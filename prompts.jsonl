Unlike a one-time, $1,400 stimulus check, a proposal for $2,000 stimulus checks every month could be available until the economy is fully recovered. Rep Ilhan Omar (D-MN) tweeted last month: \"We need $2,000 recurring checks until the end of the pandemic. I joined @TimRyan, @MichaelDTubbs, Stephanie Bonin, and Natalie Foster to push for $2,000 recurring payments for Americans until the economy is fully recovered.\"\n\nRep. Ilhan Omar on $2,000 a month stimulus checks Rep. Ilhan Omar on Twitter\n\nIn January, Omar and 55 Democrats sent a letter to President Joe Biden urging him to do more than the $1,400 stimulus check that he included in his $1.9 trillion stimulus plan.\n\nForbes Advisor $2,000 Stimulus Check Calculator: How Much You Could Receive?\n\nMore stimulus checks may be coming\n\nIf some Senate Democrats get their way, more stimulus checks and enhanced unemployment insurance may be coming. In the coming weeks, a group of Senate Democrats, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), will send a letter to urge Biden to support recurring stimulus checks until the Covid-19 pandemic is over.\n\n\"We urge you to include recurring direct payments and automatic unemployment insurance extensions tied to economic conditions in your Build Back Better long-term economic plan,\" the senators write. \"This crisis is far from over, and families deserve certainty that they can put food on the table and keep a roof over their heads. Families should not be at the mercy of constantly-shifting legislative timelines and ad hoc solutions.\"\n\nWhile the letter doesn't specify a dollar amount or frequency of the stimulus checks, some of the senators previously supported $2,000 stimulus checks every month for the duration of the Covid-19 pandemic. (Vice President Kamala Harris, who didn't sign the letter, supported $2,000 monthly stimulus checks when she was a U.S. senator). Will Congress renew this policy proposal? Supporters say stimulus checks and unemployment insurance are essential tools to lift people out of poverty. According to an Urban Institute study cited in the letter:"}

They weren't step-parents. She had four parents who genuinely loved her as if she were their own, and this man is one of them.\"\n\nThe family is using an empty urn during the funeral service today in Blue Point, New York. The service is being held at the Moloney Funeral Home. The FBI has not released Gabby's body to her family, nor have they provided a timeline as to when they might do so.\n\n\"If there is a trip you want to take – do it now while you have the time,\" Joseph said. \"If there is a relationship that might not be the best for you – leave it now.\"\n\nGabby Petito's father, Joseph, and her stepfather, Jim Schmidt, hugged after speaking during her memorial service.\n\n\"I don't want you guys to be sad,\" her father, Joseph, said to begin the service. \"Gabby didn't live that way...I'm asking you guys be inspired the way she treated people. She didn't care she genuinely loved people. I couldn't be more proud as a father.\"\n\n\"Gabby lived her life every single day,\" Jim said, \"We want to celebrate her and how she lived her life.\"\n\nBoth gave each other a hug after speaking.\n\nMourners wait in line to enter the funeral home.

Ambrose said Petito dated her cousin for about a year between 2013 and 2014.\n\n\"Since she first went missing, I did not want to believe that anything bad could have happened to her, and I'm still kind of in denial. It's hard to take in.\"\n\nAmbrose described Petito as the most \"free-spirited, kind-hearted soul\" who saw the best in everybody.\n\n\"You could do no wrong for her,\" Ambrose said. \"No person deserves this, but her – she didn't deserve this.\"\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the Petito family is requesting donations for the future Gabby Petito Foundation. Additional information can be found here.\n\nThe foundation is aimed at helping families with resources and guidance to help bring missing children home.\n\nThe memorial service takes place over two weeks since Gabby was reported missing. One week later, her body was discovered in Wyoming with the medical examiner ruling her death as a homicide.\n\nWhile she will be laid to rest in New York, hundreds in North Port held their own vigil for Gabby. In fact, the city has held several since she was first reported missing.\n\nOn Saturday night, North Port residents gathered by city hall for the first time since she was found dead. It started with a butterfly release, then a silent prayer, and a candlelight vigil.\n\nAbout 200 people attended, all to honor Gabby's life.\n\n\"It's just very heartbreaking being a mom myself,\" said Niki Doe, a North Port resident. \"I can't even imagine what her parents are going through, it's just an experience a parent should never have to go through.\"\n\nThe night before, residents New York's Blue Point community lit up Blue Point Avenue with candles and luminaires at the edges of their driveway in honor of Gabby.\n\nGabby Petito death\n\nA coroner confirmed that a body found Sunday in Wyoming was indeed Gabby. They said the manner of death was homicide. Investigators believe Brian – Gabby's fiancé – is the last person to see her alive.\n\nPetito's exact cause of death has not yet been revealed, and the final autopsy report remains to be completed."}

And during the trophy presentation, he appeared to make a sly move that one of his sponsors would love.\n\nAs he prepared to take a question on the podium, Lombardi Trophy in hand, Brady glanced down at his shirt, then pulled the collar tight around his neck – conveniently concealing the Nike logo on his undershirt.\n\nWhy is that notable? Brady is a prominent endorser of Under Armour, a Nike competitor.\n\nOn the field, Brady wears Under Armour cleats, and an Under Armour glove on his left hand. The NFL has an apparel and equipment contract with Nike. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers' uniforms, like those of every other team, are made by Nike. Their undershirts, and now their \"SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONS\" t-shirts, have Nike logos on them.\n\nBrady – likely aware how much brand visibility matters to sports apparel companies, especially on a stage as big as the Super Bowl's – perhaps realized that a quick shirt adjustment could make his appearance Nike-free.\n\nDid Brady pull a reverse Jordan?\n\nBrady isn't the first athlete to make a branding move on a celebratory podium. Team sponsorships and individual sponsorships often clash during postgame photo ops. The most famous example came at the 1992 Olympics.\n\nAt the time, Team USA was sponsored by Reebok. When the men's basketball team – popularly dubbed the \"Dream Team\" – won gold, Michael Jordan was forced to wear a Reebok warmup jacket onto a podium for the medal ceremony.\n\nJordan, a celebrated Nike endorser, found a workaround. The entire team half-unzipped their jackets to cover up the Reebok logo. Jordan, Charles Barkley and Magic Johnson draped American flags over their shoulders to be absolutely sure that the Reebok logo wouldn't be seen.\n\nIt's unclear how much thought Brady put into the shirt lift. It could have simply been a comfort move. But it very well could have been a sly nod to his Under Armour partnership.\n\nBrady's cover-up wasn't as successful as Jordan's\n\nIf it was a nod to Under Armour, though, Brady wasn't quite as clever or particular as Jordan. In other photos and videos from Brady's trophy lift, the Nike swoosh is clearly visible, front and center.\n\nTom Brady lifts the Lombardi Trophy after Super Bowl LV.

{"by": "Human", "text": "Whether Trump 'incited' Capitol riot is in eye of the beholder\n\nIt should be easy to make the political argument Trump's words are at fault. Legally, it will be more difficult.\n\nAs thousands clad in Donald Trump hats and wielding Trump flags stormed the US Capitol last Wednesday, it was Trump's own words just prior to the riot urging them to \"fight\" that is being blamed for the violence that ensued.\n\nAccording to the House resolution laying out the article of impeachment the US House of Representatives is expected to debate this week, it was Trump's speech at the Ellipse, just across the street from the White House, that is the evidence for their allegation that Trump \"engaged in high Crimes and Misdemeanors by inciting violence against the Government of the United States\".\n\nThe resolution states that \"shortly before the Joint Session\" to count the Electoral College votes and certify President-elect Joe Biden's victory \"commenced, President Trump ... reiterated false claims that 'we won this election, and we won it by a landslide'\".\n\n\"He also willfully made statements that, in context, encouraged – and foreseeably resulted in – lawless action at the Capitol, such as: 'if you don't fight like hell you're not going to have a country anymore',\" the resolution continues.\n\n\"Thus incited by President Trump, members of the crowd he addressed ... unlawfully breached and vandalized the Capitol, injured and killed law enforcement personnel, menaced Members of Congress, the Vice President, and Congressional personnel, and engaged in other violent, deadly, destructive, and seditious acts.\"\n\nThe House impeachment effort boils down to Trump's uttering of \"if you don't fight like hell you're not going to have a country anymore\".\n\nImpeachment versus legal guilt\n\nThe impeachment process is inherently a political one, not a legal one, meaning while members of Congress generally refer to legal language when considering whether a president committed \"high crimes and misdemeanours\", there is no requirement that Congress needs to legally prove that the accused is guilty of those crimes, though generally there is a lot of effort to gather as much evidence as possible.\n\nBecause the process is driven by politics, it is therefore driven by American sentiment towards the accused president and whether a majority of Americans agree with the accusations. In this case, a poll released on Sunday is the first indication that impeaching Trump might not be a very controversial move.\n\nIn the ABC News/Ipsos poll, 67 percent of Americans said Trump deserves a great deal or good amount of blame for the riot, including 69 percent of independents but only 31 percent of Republicans.\n\nThe same poll suggested that 56 percent of Americans think Trump should be removed from office before his term ends on January 20.\n\nThat is a significant difference from when Congress impeached but failed to remove Trump from office in 2019-2020. Last year, Americans were split throughout the entire process, with a clear majority never materialising to punish Trump.\n\nThe difference in Americans' opinions is a likely indicator the process this time around could move more quickly with much less controversy. Certainly, the political winds will give members who vote to impeach significant political cover against those who argue this process is happening too quickly, dispensing with the traditional lengthy investigation and deliberation given to previous successful impeachment efforts.\n\nBut just because Congress says Trump is guilty of \"inciting\" the riot, does not mean he is guilty in the eyes of the law. Congress's actions could result in Trump being removed from office or preventing him from holding office again, but it does not meet the legal bar of actually holding him liable for the illegal behaviour and destruction of the Capitol caused by the rioters.\n\nAnd that legal bar is quite high, according to experts.\n\nThe former District of Columbia assistant attorney general, Jeffrey Scott Shapiro, who has experience successfully – and unsuccessfully – convicting protesters for incitement, argues Trump did not violate any incitement laws with his speech.\n\nShapiro, who currently serves as a Trump appointee to the US Agency for Global Media, pointed out in a Wall Street Journal op-ed on Sunday: \"In the District of Columbia, it's a crime to 'intentionally or recklessly act in such a manner to cause another person to be in reasonable fear' and to 'incite or provoke violence where there is a likelihood that such violence will ensue'.\"\n\nIn addition to the \"fight\" language the House resolution cites, Shapiro mentions that another of Trump's lines from his speech is being held up as evidence of incitement: \"We're going to cheer on brave senators and congressmen and -women, and we're probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them. Because you'll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength and you have to be strong.\""}

John Bel Edwards said at a press conference Sunday afternoon.\n\n\"We're just getting started,\" he said.\n\nThe storm came ashore as a Category 4 storm in Port Fourchon on the Louisiana coast just before noon Sunday. With 150 mile-per-hour winds, it is one of the strongest hurricanes to make landfall in Louisiana since the middle of the 19th century.\n\n\"There is no doubt that the coming days and weeks are going to be extremely difficult for our state, and many, many people are going to be tested in ways that we can only imagine today,\" Edwards said. \"But I can also tell you that, as a state, we've never been more prepared.\"\n\nIda arrived on the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina — which destroyed much of New Orleans – and two days after the first anniversary of Hurricane Laura, which devastated Lake Charles in the southwestern region of the state.\n\nEdwards said southeastern Louisiana residents who stayed for Hurricane Ida need to be prepared to \"shelter in place\" for 72 hours after the storm has passed. Search and rescue crews won't be able to start their work until Monday morning, he said.\n\n\"We will be ready at first light tomorrow morning to go out in those areas that we know already have received the most damaging impacts of the storm,\" Edwards said.\n\nLouisiana's entire National Guard — nearly 5,000 people — have been called up to service. The state fire marshal, law enforcement and Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries agents will also be involved in search and rescue missions — and there's an additional 900 people on loan from 16 other states available to help, Edwards said.\n\nBy Sunday evening, Ida had already hit Louisiana's coastal towns like Houma, which is home to a large segment of the state's commercial fishing operations and the nexus of the offshore oil and gas industry. Ida also walloped Grand Isle, a popular vacation spot, though Edwards said almost the entire population of that barrier island had been evacuated before the storm.\n\nFrom Sunday evening to Monday morning, Ida is expected to creep its way up into the most populous areas of Louisiana — hitting New Orleans, Baton Rouge and the northshore of Lake Pontchartrain hard. Communities will not not only face the strongest winds they have seen in decades, but may also be inundated with flooding for much of the rest of the week, according to local weather reports.\n\nMany coastal parishes put mandatory evacuations in place Friday. Notably, New Orleans did not. New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell said the storm was moving too quickly by Friday evening to safely make that call, but thousands of residents fled the city voluntarily, resulting in hours-long traffic jams on interstates going to Texas and Florida on Saturday.\n\nLouisiana is trying to avoid some of the problems it saw in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The Department of Public Safety and Corrections has agreed to house 2,500 jail detainees and prisoners from Acadia, Plaquemines, St. Mary, Orleans, St. Bernard, Vermillion and Terrebonne parishes. After Hurricane Katrina, people in jails struggled to get access to food and water.\n\nEdwards also insisted Sunday that the state is \"more prepared than it ever has been\" for a hurricane of Ida's magnitude. After Hurricane Katrina, the federal government spent billions of dollars developing a new protection system consisting of levees and floodgates around New Orleans and its surrounding parishes. Though Louisiana has been threatened with other storms in recent years, Hurricane Ida is the first time the state intends to make use of the full protection system.\n\n\"Will [New Orleans storm protection system] be tested? Yes. But it was built for this moment,\" Edwards said.\n\nThe governor said about 1,400 people were being housed in public shelters across the state Sunday afternoon, but expected that number to grow. Power companies are warning Louisiana residents that they could be without electricity — and air conditioning — for several days.\n\nThe governor expects that more people will find their homes uninhabitable after the hurricane passes. The state has enough capacity to house approximately 10,300 people now and more public shelters will be opened."}

In fact, he's been more late-game clutch than overall dominant, even in winning four Super Bowl MVPs.\n\nHere is our ranking of his first nine Super Bowl performances:\n\n1. Super Bowl LI: Patriots 34, Falcons 28 (2016)\n\nIt was on pace to be Brady's worst Super Bowl in the third quarter, when the Patriots trailed 28-3 and the quarterback's most noteworthy play was throwing a pick-six. But he orchestrated the biggest Super Bowl comeback in the first one ever to go to overtime by completing 43-of-62 passes for 466 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nBrady completed third-down passes to three different receivers on the game-tying 91-yard touchdown drive — then capped it with a must-have 2-point conversion pass. The halftime adjustment to target 1-on-1 coverage outside the numbers was brilliant.\n\n2. Super Bowl XLIX: Patriots 28, Seahawks 24 (2014)\n\nYou remember Malcolm Butler's goal-line interception, but did you forget the Patriots' 10-point fourth-quarter comeback?\n\nUndeterred by the dark cloud of Deflategate and an unthinkable decade-long championship drought, Brady was 37-of-50 for 328 yards and four touchdowns with two interceptions. But he was 13-of-15 for 124 yards with two touchdowns in the fourth quarter against the NFL's top-ranked defense, anchored by its secondary.\n\n3. Super Bowl LII: Eagles 41, Patriots 33 (2017)\n\nLike the only other quarterback ever to throw for 500 yards in the playoffs — Ben Roethlisberger, three weeks ago — Brady lost. Unlike Roethlisberger, Brady wasn't piling up meaningless stats.\n\nBrady took shots down the field in completing 28-of-48 passes for 505 yards — including 237 yards while throwing under pressure — and three touchdowns with no interceptions. But he was strip-sacked by Brandon Graham in the closing minutes of a shootout.\n\n4. Super Bowl XXXVIII: Patriots 32, Panthers 29 (2003)\n\nGraduation day! The end of knocking Brady as a game-manager came when he led two scoring drives in the final four minutes of the first half and two more in the final three minutes of the second half. He threw for 354 yard and three touchdowns — one of which claimed the lead with three minutes to go — on a then-record 32 completions.\n\nAfter the Panthers tied the score with 68 seconds left, Brady set up Adam Vinatieri in range for the winning field goal.\n\n5. Super Bowl XXXVI: Patriots 20, Rams 17 (2001)\n\nWho is this guy? He was the backup who replaced Drew Bledsoe early that season.\n\nBrady's final numbers were those of a caretaker: 16-of-27 for 145 yards with one touchdown and no interceptions. But his legend was born in the final 90 seconds, when the great broadcaster John Madden suggested the Patriots should play for overtime. Brady completed five passes — including a 23-yarder to Troy Brown — to set up the last-second field goal.\n\n6. Super Bowl XXXIX: Patriots 24, Eagles 21 (2004)\n\nThe win that cemented the dynasty.\n\nDonovan McNabb had the gaudy stats (357 yards, three touchdowns) but made the mistakes (three interceptions) his counterpart did not. Linebacker Mike Vrabel caught one of Brady's two touchdown passes, and favorite target Deion Branch exploded for 11 catches, 133 yards and MVP honors.\n\n7. Super Bowl XLVI: Giants 21, Patriots 17 (2011)"}

Scary enough that the odds of keeping his leg once stood \"damn-near 50/50,\" according to Tiger himself.\n\n\"There was a point in time when, I wouldn't say it was 50/50, but it was damn-near there if I was going to walk out of that hospital with one leg,\" Woods told Golf Digest in an interview released Monday.\n\nThe revelation comes on the heels of Woods' first public comments in nearly nine months: a 40-minute interview in which Woods discussed his injuries, his path back to professional golf, and his advice for his son Charlie.\n\nOn the topic of the accident in Rolling Hills Estates, Calif., Woods had plenty to say — though the news might come as a stark dose of reality for many hoping for a similar comeback to the one Woods completed in 2018. The 15-time major champion seemed resigned to the fact that his body no longer has what it takes to compete regularly at a high level.\n\n\"I don't have to compete and play against the best players in the world to have a great life,\" he said. \"After my back fusion, I had to climb Mount Everest one more time. I had to do it, and I did. This time around, I don't think I'll have the body to climb Mount Everest, and that's okay.\"\n\nInstead, Woods seemed to indicate his desire to follow in the footsteps of Ben Hogan, playing only a select number of tournaments at his own discretion. But that future is still a long way from the present.\n\n\"I think something that is realistic is playing the Tour one day — never full time, ever again — but pick and choose, just like [Ben] Hogan did,\" he said. \"Pick and choose a few events a year and you play around that, you practice around that, and you gear yourself up for that. I think that's how I'm going to have to play it from now on. It's an unfortunate reality, but it's my reality. I understand it, and I accept it.\"\n\nWoods spoke extensively about the rehab process, including a prolonged stay in isolation in southern California, during which time he received near round-the-clock treatment.\n\n\"In a hotel room and I'm hooked up with wires everywhere and people poking and prodding me at 2-3 in the morning for more bloodwork,\" he said. \"It was just like, c'mon. You know? How much is enough?\"\n\nOnce Woods recovered to the point that he was no longer at risk of amputation, his attention shifted to his hands — testing to see he'd kept his dexterity in the wake of the crash.\n\n\"I wanted to test and see that I still had my hands. So even in the hospital, I had Erica [Herman] and Rob [McNamara] throw me something,\" he said. \"Throw it over here, catch it over there. Then the nurse comes in. 'What? I wasn't doing anything?' Nurse leaves, 'Okay, let's go!' We were being kids, we were isolated, we were doing shenanigans. Just anything to pass the time.\"\n\nIn March, he returned home to Florida after nearly a month in the hospital. He was kept inside for months, leaning on lessons from his father Earl to endure grueling rehab sessions.\n\n\"This is where my dad's teachings came into play,\" he said. \"Being in the military, you don't know how long a firefight's going to take. It could last five seconds, it could last five hours. Some could go on for days at a time. You don't know when the end is. That's the hard part.\""}
