Manning, a two-time Super Bowl winner and brother of Peyton Manning, retired from football last year and has since kept a low profile compared to his sibling.

But even outside of his professional career, Powell's commitment to repairing and sustaining things was evident.\n\nAt his memorial service, his son Michael recalled his father's efforts to fix a batch of defective adding machines, an anecdote that highlighted Powell's frugality, curiosity, and drive to repair rather than discard.\n\nPowell's impressive career was marked by a swift rise to becoming a four-star general and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He was the first African-American to hold the position.\n\nHowever, when it came to the decision to invade Iraq, Powell faced a dilemma that seemed to contradict his own \"Powell doctrine\" of using force only when necessary.

I will also discuss how the trial of Ahmaud Arbery's killers highlights the inconsistencies in self-defense claims, and how the Rittenhouse case calls into question the current interpretation of self-defense laws.\n\nThe acquittal of Kyle Rittenhouse, who was charged with shooting three men during a Kenosha riot, has sparked outcry and criticism for celebrating an individual whose actions have been deemed lawful. President Trump's celebration of Rittenhouse as a symbol of self-defense against lawlessness has done nothing to quell the controversy.\n\nCritics of the acquittal argue that Rittenhouse's actions are not reflective of justice and serve to undermine core principles of the law.

However, a new study has found that the impact on gas prices was significantly less than media initially reported.\n\nThe study, co-authored by Associate Professor Tsvetan Tsvetanov and doctoral student Srishti Slaria, found that the shutdown only led to a 4-cents-per-gallon increase in average gasoline prices in affected areas. This is significantly less than the 25- to 50-cent increases initially reported by media.\n\nThe study used daily regular gasoline price data at the city level and employed a difference-in-differences approach, comparing prices before and after the shutdown. This allowed researchers to isolate the impact of the shutdown on gas prices.\n\nThe Colonial Pipeline provides about 40% of the East Coast's fuel needs and 60% of the Midwest's. The shutdown forced gas stations to rely on other sources of supply, causing prices to spike.\n\nHowever, the shutdown was short-lived and the pipeline was back online in less than two weeks. This allowed the market to quickly adjust and prices to go back to normal.\n\nOverall, the shutdown was a wake-up call for the U.S. energy infrastructure and its vulnerability to cyberattacks. It also highlighted the resilience of the market, as prices quickly returned to normal levels after the shutdown."}
