In a statement, Alex Villanueva, LA County Sheriff, said there was 'no evidence of impairment' in Tiger Woods' SUV. The LA Times quotes him as saying, \"We have no cause of the crash as of yet.\"\n\nIn an effort to make the story more dramatic, authorities have tried to make it look like the SUV crashed through a fence and ended up in a wooded area. While the Sheriff's Department acknowledges that there was a fence that was hit in the crash, Woods' car was partially submerged in water and he was found sitting on the ground outside of his SUV a few blocks away, according to the Times.\n\nIn the statement, the Sheriff's Department said that the crash was an accident because of what they call 'impairment of consciousness.' That means a driver must not be able to remember what happened to him, according to CNN. The statement even says that the crash was due to \"a sudden change in roadway conditions, resulting in a loss of control of the SUV.\"\n\nThe statement also says there is \"no cause of the crash as of yet,\" which again makes it seem as if the incident was completely out of Woods' control and the authorities are just trying to make a dramatic statement that the crash was not intentional.\n\nThis is a very unethical way to go about investigating a possible crime. Experts say that if a driver is driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol, they would have a harder time remembering what happened to them. It makes it even more difficult to determine whether or not a person was driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, especially when they were unconscious.\n\nAs the Sheriff's Dept. continues to try to make this crash a tragic accident, it does little to help the public. Instead of focusing on what caused the crash and trying to help Tiger Woods and his family deal with the aftermath, the Sheriff's Dept. seems to be focusing on what happened to Tiger's SUV and trying to paint Tiger as the one who caused a crash that he clearly wasn't at fault for.\n\nExperts say they are frustrated with the LA County Sheriff's Department's lack of transparency. They are also upset that there has been little publicity about the case, especially since they say that the lack of transparency is due to authorities' attempts to make this crash seem more dramatic than it actually was."}

The journey was not meant to be a positive one. It was to be a last resort, an escape. And for most Washington Post reporters, it actually was an escape. On August 30, two days after the Taliban took over Kabul, we were given a chance to travel to Qatar on a chartered plane. Washington Post's staff in Kabul had previously been the subject of assault from Taliban gunmen who had tried to kill us twice while we tried to flee Kabul, and I was worried for Aziz Tassal, my daughter and others who were with us. He was one of the first to leave the capital, in a convoy provided by the United States, on August 29. We left Kandahar on a bus, and then took a helicopter to Kabul. On arrival at the Kabul airport on Monday, August 30, we were met by U.S. and Afghan officials and led to a waiting chartered flight to Qatar. When we arrived at the airport in Kabul on Monday August 30, we were met by U.S. and Afghan officials and taken to a waiting chartered flight to Qatar. Aziz Tassal, my daughter and others were beaten up by militants who tried to stop us from leaving Kandahar to return to Kabul, where they had been beaten up. The United States was aware the Taliban were moving to take over Kabul and the situation had become very dangerous. But the U.S. and Afghan governments were just not equipped to provide an evacuation flight. The Taliban were taking the city by force, and there were hundreds of thousands of people trapped inside. We couldn't even get to the airport. So we had to return to Kandahar, where Aziz Tassal was shot several times and injured, where I was beaten up by militants who tried to stop us from leaving Kandahar to return to Kabul, where we had been beaten up. The Biden administration were escalating evacuation plans, but could not provide us with a safe passage."}

Facebook users can now comment on German election debates Facebook bans political posts and posts from users who hate Jews or Muslims More than a million comments and 10 million likes have been posted in less than an hour on the Bundestag debate, which was streamed live on Facebook. Facebook said it had blocked comments on the debate due to a series of hate speech posts that were not content violations. In its verdict, the court added that Facebook's community standards, which prohibit users from posting content that constitutes a direct threat to another person, violated European law. The Federal Court of Justice also condemned Facebook for not offering users a right of appeal against their posts being removed and their accounts being blocked. \"The Federal Court of Justice's decision demonstrates that Facebook, as a media company, is responsible towards its users,\" Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement. Facebook was given the power to block users who violated its terms of service in 2008. In a statement, Facebook said it had blocked the user because some of her posts were \"significant violations of our Community Standards policy\". The German lawyer who filed the case has called the ruling \"a victory for free speech\". \"This is not the first time that we see such an unfolding on Facebook,\" she added. The decision means Facebook has no legal grounds to block or delete content that violates its community standards, the court added. The ruling comes as the Bundestag is holding its final debate before the May 24 election. The Social Democrats are in a lead of more than 16 points.

The accident at the Suez Canal could have been far worse, had the container ship not been diverted to the port of Mombasa instead of the port of Ismailia. In the run-up to the inauguration of the new U.S. administration, we take a look at the causes of this tragedy and what we can learn from it. One of the lessons that we have learned from the recent shipwreck at the Suez Canal is the importance of communication and the need for better communication in order to prevent accidents like this in the future. We have learned that the relationship between management and crew should be strong and trusting. In this case, communication was poor, and this was the source of the problem. So if the management and the crew can improve their relationship, I think accidents like the Suez Canal will be much less likely in the future. The accident at the Suez Canal could not have happened if the operator of the ship, Everting Marine, had made the right choices. So it was the human factor that played a major role. What we can learn from this is that the operators of container ships should pay more attention to human factors and the need to improve communication between the management and the crew."}

However, the \"plus-up\" has caused confusion for millions of Americans who need to know why they are getting a payment in their bank account. The news media is reporting that some families will receive a second payment of $1,400 in the form of a child tax credit. This is correct, however the details of how many families will receive this are not yet known. This is due to the fact that the details of CTC payments are determined after the US census is taken in October of this year, and it is only after that that we will know how many families will receive these payments and how much they will be. This means that the first round of payments will be made in November and the second round will be paid out in February of 2021. The purpose of these payments is to address the impacts of the economic downturn caused by the pandemic. This is not the first time that the Child Tax Credit has been subject to a \"plus-up\" but this has been part of the child tax credit for some time now and has been called the \"plus-up\" since 2008. However the new American Rescue Plan that was unveiled in September of this year has added to these payments. The \"plus-up\" is triggered when a family has a lower income than they used to, or when they have a child. The details of how the \"plus-up\" works will be explained in the next section of this story. It will be announced after the census is taken in October of 2021. It is also important to note that it is not always necessary to receive a \"plus-up\" payment. The amount of money that you will get will be determined based on your own income level and whether you have children. The new American Rescue Plan will be unveiled in September 2021. The CTC was a huge part of the Rescue Plan, but there are also \"plus-up\" payments being made to some of the American families. This is the second biggest part of the plan.

Cuomo said Wednesday that the news of his suspension was \"unfortunate to hear,\" but he still understood CNN's decision. \"I understand that this is what is happening. This is not good for me personally or good for the network. I understand that. But, I also understand that it is an opportunity for me to take another path forward,\" Cuomo said on SiriusXM's \"News at Night.\" Cuomo was scheduled to appear on CNN's Anderson Cooper's show Wednesday, but the network extended the program to make way for Cuomo's show."}

He had no idea they had SIVs, and he took them out, in case they were needed. He says the cousins had been out and about for several weeks when they were hit in the air strike, but were not carrying weapons or explosives on them.

The cause of the power failure is not yet known, but it's clear that the state's power grid has not been this vulnerable in a long time. The storm's power failure devastated the Texas power grid, leaving hundreds of thousands of people without power On February 21, Texas suffered a winter storm, followed by heavy ice and snow on February 22 and 23, which resulted in widespread power outages across the state. In the aftermath of the storm, more than 1,300 people were hospitalized, and 151 people were confirmed to have died. However, BuzzFeed's data review suggests that this could be a much higher number of fatalities, and an analysis by the Texas governor suggests that the death toll could be as high as four times that number. The Houston Chronicle ran an article with the headline, \"Lost power could be killing Texas residents.\" The headline caught the eye of BuzzFeed's data team and drove traffic to the article, leading to over half a million page views, over 200,000 unique visitors, and 4.1 million impressions in the first two days of the story on February 24 and 25. The original article is still available on the Chronicle's website. According to the Texas governor, more than 1,300 people were hospitalized with severe respiratory problems after the storm, which was followed by heavy ice and snow on February 22 and 23. No deaths had been confirmed at the time. On February 24 and 25, BuzzFeed's data team did a simple analysis. We used an \"excess fatalities\" analysis, comparing the number of deaths that happened during the storm week to those during normal conditions. Our analysis suggests that the February winter storm could have killed between 426 and 978 more people than normal. In fact, the exact number could be higher, because data on how many people are injured in accidents during the storm week does not yet exist. In the aftermath of the storm, 151 people were confirmed to have died. The data team also estimated that the storm week alone could have killed 702 people. The analysis is based on state records in the past decade, and we also looked at other states with similar weather, but without the same widespread power outages that occurred in Texas, to see if they had a spike in deaths. To do that, we analyzed data from each state over the past decade, looking for similar weather patterns to the one we saw in Texas. We found states that experienced similar weather patterns to Texas, but without widespread power outages, like Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia. Those states did not see a spike in deaths."}

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been granted asylum in an Ecuadorian embassy after fleeing Sweden last year to avoid being extradited to the United States . Merrick Garland is the official in the US charged with prosecuting him for espionage . The CIA is seeking to obtain a court order to detain Assange on grounds that he could pose a danger to national security should he be moved to another country . Assange has been granted asylum in an Ecuadorian embassy, after fleeing Sweden in June last year to avoid extradition to the US for allegedly leaking classified information to Wikileaks . Last month, he said it was highly unlikely that Assange would be extradited after he had already been granted sanctuary . Members of the Intelligence Committee have sought information from CIA officials and Office of the Director of National Intelligence officials about a possible plot to kidnap Assange and torture him, reports Yahoo News. The panel's chairman, Adam Schiff, did not know about the plans when they emerged in 2017. The CIA and the ODNI say they have not received any requests from the committee for information about this alleged plot, according to the reports. The CIA is reportedly divided over the prospect of a prosecution of Assange, who has been fighting extradition from Sweden on charges of sexual assault, despite being granted asylum in the Ecuadorean embassy in London last year. Earlier this year, Reuters reported that CIA chief Gina Haspel had been reluctant to pursue an extradition for fear of upsetting allies.

This strategy would be a dangerous gamble for the U.S. and Afghanistan, but the U.S. military is willing to take that risk to reduce the overall threat of U.S. troops in Afghanistan. U.S.-led forces are trying to stop ISIS-K militants from capturing the rest of the country, but the U.S. is preparing to let ISIS-K, and other militants, move on to threaten Kabul if they think it's safest to do so, said a U.S. official.

The next round is expected to be slightly larger than the first, though it will be distributed in a more fragmented way with many states receiving their own version. Here are five things to know about the next round of stimulus payments, which are beginning to be distributed in some parts of the country: 1. $4 Stimulus Check Will Be Unlikely A fourth stimulus check is unlikely to happen despite a petition for $2,000 recurring payments gaining over 2.9 million signatures. That petition is being forwarded to President Trump and congressional leaders, but it remains to be seen if it will make its way to the White House. Instead, most of the checks being distributed in this round will be smaller and more targeted to individuals who already qualify for them. These include: . 2. States Providing Additional Financial Relief Some states are already providing additional financial relief due to the gap in federal support, with millions of California receiving a second Golden State Stimulus check of $600 to $1,100, per CNN . The state of California, for instance, is providing another round of $600 to $1,100 checks to those individuals who have not already qualified. These individuals will receive a second round of $600 checks, an additional $300 per child if they have a child, and $300 if they have two or more children. These amounts will gradually increase as the child gets older, to $1,200 per child from age three to age 12. 3. Low-income Marylanders Eligible for Direct Payments Marylanders will be eligible for direct payments of $300 or $500 . Those eligible will begin receiving the payments starting this week . These payments will be available through December, with future aid discussed in federal budget packages .

The following excerpts from his book reflect on his experiences as a U.S. Army officer, as well as his views on the military and society in general. He has served as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and now is the U.S. Secretary of Defense. He is married with two adult children. The U.S. Army is a small part of the large U.S. military and its personnel make up for only 5 percent of the total U.S. military force. Only about 20 percent of active-duty soldiers are women and their families make up about 15 percent of active-duty military families. Approximately 1 percent of the total U.S. population is comprised of service members and their families. During the height of Desert Storm in January 1991, U.S. President George H.W. Bush, the nation's Commander-in-Chief, made the decision to send U.S. troops to the Persian Gulf to defend U.S. homeland and citizens from Persian Gulf states that sought to invade and attack the U.S. Bush was concerned that the United States could become involved in a major conflict in the region and he wanted to avoid the kind of warfare that had been occurring in the war-torn former Soviet Union states. Bush decided that the U.S. military would go to the Persian Gulf to defend against a war that would not last more than a year. This would be a short war, with limited use of military force. As a way to assure the U.S. public that the U.S. was not about to go to war, President Bush issued a statement to the nation that it would be a short war and there would be limited use of military force. As a result, there were relatively few protests against the U.S. troop deployment. When President Bush sent the troops to the Persian Gulf, he had to deal with a large troop build-up as well as an increase in U.S. military spending due to the large U.S. troop deployment. U.S."}

How did DarkSide respond to the attack? How did DarkSide make money and why did they target Colonial in the first place? Was this the last attack by DarkSide, or are they likely to return? Take a look at the latest information about the DarkSide ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline and whether they are planning another attack in the future. DarkSide's website is also vulnerable to backdoors found in their operating system. Colonial paid around $5 million for a decryption key, as reported by Bloomberg on May 13. In recent months, DarkSide's ransomware group has targeted other businesses around the world. This has led to criticism of the group's ransomware for its apparent double extortion tactic. Earlier this week, DarkSide released some information about the Colonial attack, including video showing the hackers being led to believe they had been hacked by a spooky man wearing a white hat. However, the website does not contain any of DarkSide's code, suggesting the ransomware attack may have been carried out by a third-party contractor, rather than the hacker collective itself. DarkSide has already targeted other corporations, but this attack is the first time a US-based corporation has taken part in the group's extortion scheme. In a statement released by the US government on May 11, the US State Department said it is aware of DarkSide's attack on Colonial Pipeline. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is investigating the incident. DarkSide is a notorious ransomware group that has previously targeted other US businesses, most recently a bank in Florida earlier this month. However, this is the first time they have targeted a US-based corporation. Colonial Pipeline has paid more than $5 million for a decryption key to unlock its data, according to a Bloomberg report on May 13. Colonial Pipeline is the world's largest pipeline operator and is based in Houston, Texas, US. The pipeline has been targeted in previous attacks, including one in 2017 when hackers stole 100GB of data. That attack appears to have been linked to the SolarWinds cyberattack earlier this year, which has been widely reported. The SolarWinds cyberattack was one of the largest hacks on US infrastructure in recent times. The SolarWinds cyberattack was announced by Microsoft in December 2018, and appears to have targeted US government agencies and US-based companies. The SolarWinds attack was linked to an attack on SolarWinds Orion, a piece of government software, in May 2020. This appears to have been conducted by a third party contractor. DarkSide has previously targeted other US businesses, but this attack is the first time they have targeted a US-based corporation.

This is not to say that Hollywood should be held responsible for any fatalities that happen on film set, but they should be held accountable for these shootings. These shootings occurred in two very different countries, yet the similarities are alarming. Let's start with the similarities: Both Brandon Lee and Halyna Hutchins were working on film and television projects when they were killed. The incidents were both accidental and neither shooting was premeditated, the FBI and USADA are saying. However, they did happen on sets that should be safe to work in. Both Brandon Lee and Halyna Hutchins were working on projects at film studios in the U.S. Both of the shooters were unarmed when they were killed. In both shootings, a piece of ammunition was found in the shotgun used by the shooter, either in the magazine, in the firearm, or in the grip of the shooter. Both shooters were mentally ill when they were killed. Brandon Lee was killed in a shooting at a Hollywood film set in 1993, while Hutchins was killed in a shooting at a Texas film set in 2021. Both shooters used guns that were supposed to be safe and functional, but that did not stop them from carrying out the murderous actions. In both shootings, the FBI and USADA say that the shooters were not properly screened for firearms and mental health. And both shooters died on film sets that were supposed to be safe places of work. What is interesting, however, is that the two incidents happened in different countries. While Brandon Lee died in 1993 in the U.S., Halyna Hutchins was killed in 2021 in Texas, USA. In both instances, the shooters were unarmed and the film set should have been safe places of work. Both were mentally ill when they died, the FBI and USADA are saying. However, Brandon Lee died on a U.S. movie set, while Halyna Hutchins was killed in Texas on a Texas movie set. There is no way to know if Brandon Lee died in a tragic accident or premeditated murder, but we know that he was killed on a U.S. film set. Halyna Hutchins was killed on a Texas film set, but that is the only information we have on her death.

Rittenhouse has been released on bond.\n\nThe decision was largely viewed in the media as a case of injustice, as Rittenhouse, who is not affiliated with any political party, was not charged with any racially motivated violence.\n\nBut the Rittenhouse case has also been an opportunity to examine some of the many legal issues raised by the case, including:\n\nRittenhouse was acquitted of all charges, with the jury arguing that he acted in self-defense during an August 2018 altercation with two black men.\n\nWhat about Rittenhouse's acquittal did you find particularly striking? What about what has changed about the legal system that might be good for society? How has the media reacted to this decision? Is there a way in which we can use this as an opportunity to improve? You can submit your thoughts to Daily Wire by clicking here. A police officer in the county in which Kyle Rittenhouse allegedly killed two black men has had his job taken away from him after making a statement about the case in which he supported Rittenhouse, USA Today reports. William Kelly, 51, had nearly 20 years of service with Norfolk police and had made his comments on Facebook. Kelly is accused of refusing to tell authorities that he had seen video of Rittenhouse shooting two black men in broad daylight in 2017, USA Today notes, citing the sheriff's office. Kelly resigned from Norfolk police in March after Rittenhouse's acquittal, according to the sheriff's office. He was accused of making comments about Rittenhouse during an interview with the Milwaukee Sentinel in April. Kelly's firing was announced Monday on the Norfolk police department's Facebook page, which noted that Kelly had resigned and was no longer employed by Norfolk. Kelly had been involved in Rittenhouse's defense, the sheriff's office said. Kelly's attorney says Kelly did not tell the sheriff's office that he had seen videos of Rittenhouse shooting two men because he does not know what could have happened to him, USA Today reports. Kelly's attorney said he wasn't aware of the sheriff's office's explanation for Kelly's firing. \"He has no comment,\" a lawyer for Kelly said."}

Andrew Cuomo, the company announced Tuesday. Chris Cuomo's firing from CNN comes as the media giant continues to be grappling with questions about its handling of storylines involving some of its most prominent reporters. CNN has been facing questions over its leadership since the summer. In a press release announcing Cuomo's firing, the company noted that while Cuomo did not have a conflict of interest over the story he handled, the company had \"found a number of discrepancies\" between the content of the story and CNN's own reporting guidelines. Anderson Cooper addressed the firing in his CNN Now interview on Tuesday night and was visibly emotional as he emphasized the importance of ethical reporting and the need to be transparent in journalism. Cuomo is not the first major figure to be fired by CNN, but his firing is being widely seen as a watershed event in the company's history. CNN's conduct over the past few years has been widely criticized for not being transparent enough in the handling of news stories."}

The verdict is due on a number of charges including second-degree murder, manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter. Derek Chauvin is accused of killing George Floyd during a Minneapolis police custody investigation on May 25, 2020. Here are the five most important things you need to know about the case this week:\n\nAs a result, Derek Chauvin was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the death of George Floyd and acquitted of second-degree murder and manslaughter, though he was found guilty of a lesser charge of involuntary manslaughter in the death of 3-year-old Trayvon Martin, and was sentenced to 21 years to life in prison and ordered to pay $300,000 in civil damages to George Floyd's family. The other jurors agreed with the decision and returned a 12-1 vote to convict Chauvin of manslaughter. The jury acquitted Chauvin of involuntary manslaughter and second-degree murder, with 11 other jurors supporting acquittal. Howard wrote that she was not sure what the jury found, as she was not present during the deliberations. But she believed the bodycam footage and expert testimony were critical to the conviction, and she will be watching the verdict in hopes it supports her position, she said. Dr. Martin Tobin's testimony, asserting George Floyd died from asphyxiation, impacted Howard significantly, she said. She praised that he did not receive payment for his testimony, adding to his credibility, as well as Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo's testimony against Chauvin's tactics. Howard's comments came after the conclusion of Monday's deliberations and before her verdict is read aloud on Wednesday at 1:01 a.m. ET.

Exploiting the system of racial control and exploitation that exists at the heart of American policing, Derek Chauvin and his fellow officers racially discriminated against unarmed black men in Minneapolis. But their actions did not justify killing them and they will not be pardoned.\n\nChauvin's conviction signals that the United States is moving in new directions. It is time to end the endless cycle of racism, white supremacy and policing that is killing tens of thousands of black and brown Americans each year.\n\nRead David Leonhardt's full column here\n\nEven without racial bias, policing won't solve the problems of inequality and exploitation. One of the many tragedies of the United States has been that people have not considered policing as a system of racial discrimination.\n\nThe system works as follows. We are all equally entitled to the freedom of movement under the rule of law. That is the cornerstone of our democracy. In other words, when we are at the mercy of a police officer who decides whether we can go to the grocery store or a convenience store, it is not a free society.\n\nFor decades, police, many of whom were white, discriminated and exploited black and brown people in the name of protecting the public. The result is that Americans are at the mercy of the police and they depend on them for access to basic human needs.\n\nAt a time when we need to focus the anger about the killing of George Floyd at the hands of a police officer on racism, the system of racial control and exploitation at the heart of American policing should also be considered. This is not a problem of George Floyd's death alone. It is a system that benefits white supremacists and racists, but harms blacks and brown people.\n\nBut most importantly, the system of racial control and exploitation creates a cycle of violence that lasts many years. By killing unarmed black people in the name of protecting the public, white supremacists are creating a vicious cycle of revenge. The result is that many black and brown men and women are killed by police in the same way that George Floyd was killed.\n\nChauvin's conviction signals that the United States is moving in new directions. It is time to end the endless cycle of racism, white supremacy, and policing that is killing tens of thousands of black and brown Americans each year."}

So he was unable to calculate the exact likelihood of Brady winning seven or more Super Bowls with his current deal with Bayern Munich.

His legacy of conflict, from Vietnam to Afghanistan, has left many people mourning. In his time as defense secretary, Rumsfeld presided over the largest military expansion since World War II, including the longest war in U.S. history: the Vietnam War. After 9/11 he was the architect of the Bush administration's war efforts. He also oversaw the deployment of cluster bombs in Afghanistan that inadvertently endangered civilians. This article argues that Rumsfeld's actions were misguided and that the U.S. had a better way of handling the conflict in Afghanistan. There is no doubt that Rumsfeld was a key neoconservative architect of the Bush administration's war efforts post 9/11. But much of his legacy is a legacy of conflict. And it is a conflict that has killed and injured thousands of civilians across the world. Not only were his policies a disaster in Afghanistan, where he presided over a war that killed tens of thousands of innocent civilians, but also in Vietnam, where he allowed the U.S. to launch a full-scale attack on a communist power without proper planning and without any prior warning to the Vietnam government.

The shooting death of Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins by Alec Baldwin on Christmas Day 2017 is not just a personal tragedy for Baldwin; it was a tragedy for the entire filmmaking community and for those who worked on the film.

Before I knew it, I heard about the injuries sustained by the director Joel Souza and Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. We all knew that Alec Baldwin was drunk, and we were all shocked and saddened by what happened to this young man, who was supposed to be responsible for the safety of everyone in the film, including himself. A few days later, it was revealed that there were more than 12 rounds of bullets that Alec...

He was one of the most revered military figures of his time, and a great statesman. Still, his legacy and those of others like him are rarely remembered with a high state funeral in this country. This is especially noticeable in the current moment, during a pandemic and a time of social unrest. In the wake of Colin Powell's funeral, here are three things we need more of in the U.S.: Public funerals. By all accounts, Colin Powell's coffin was brought to Washington National Cathedral on a private plane, following his death from complications of covid-19. While it might have seemed an odd way to transport a former Secretary of State's casket, this was the only way to honor Powell's wishes, according to those who knew him. In many ways, this was a reflection on the division in the U.S. While a private funeral can be a good option for families, it is especially important that a public funeral be given to someone of Colin Powell's stature, so that the world can reflect on his achievements. The post-WWII United States is marked by what some consider to be a division between \"us\" and \"them.\" When the civil rights movement and the Great Migration ended segregation, Americans were united, and the country seemed headed toward a bright future. Over the past several decades, however, Americans have increasingly been torn up over divisive issues such as race, class, gender, and religion. Since the 1950s, Americans have not had a funeral state of their own. While Powell was a great statesman and great military leader, this is not a time for reflection and national healing. Powell's body is currently lying in state for seven days at the Washington National Cathedral, which was his alma mater. After that time, his family will return the casket to Florida to lay him to rest at Camp David, where he had previously spent much of his last days. The casket will be on display during his final resting place at Camp David for seven days. During that time, the nation will reflect on Powell's contributions to the country and to the United States. Over the last three weeks, Americans have protested against police brutality and police violence against Black people. While Powell's death was not directly tied to these protests, he was a key figure in..."}

This is what some women are worried about, according to this week's story by CNN's Vanessa Been. Rashida Yasin writes from Kabul that for some women, the return of the Taliban to power is a bad thing. Here's why: It will be hard to make progress if there is no support of women - and there isn't much if the Taliban doesn't take them seriously, she says. In Herat, dozens of women have staged a protest demanding equal rights and equal opportunities - and there are calls for more similar protests in Kabul. Here is some of Vanessa Been's other stories this week: 1. This week's report from Afghanistan shows that as the U.S. pulls out, there are signs of life on the ground that could signal a positive turn for women . 2. Some fear that the Taliban's promise of a better future for women will be hollow . 3. Other women say the Taliban is not going to allow for equal rights in the near future . 4. Many women in the country have also suffered the devastation of war . The Afghan capital of Kabul is beginning to see signs of life returning after American troops pulled out. The airport and a hospital have reopened. But the Taliban is also back in power and some women are worried that the return could be a bad thing. They fear they will not have equal rights, especially in the new cabinet. And some say the Taliban is not going to allow equal rights in the near future. Women from Herat in western Afghanistan have staged a protest demanding equal rights, equal opportunities, and access to basic services. They want to work and send their sons to school. \"I want women to be included in the government so the government can do something for women,\" she tells CNN. \"I am a woman and I want to go to school, work and send my sons to school. I want a good life for my sons.\" She says she hopes the government will change soon. The Taliban's previous rule in the late 1990s was marked by severe oppression, particularly towards women. Many were barred from working or attending school. And in 2000, the Taliban banned women from driving. The government later relaxed the ban. Many now drive, but there are still restrictions. The U.S. Embassy has said that it continues to urge the Afghan government to ensure women's rights are not eroded after the U.S. withdraws. Experts from Qatar and Turkey are working to reopen Kabul airport after the U.S. withdrawal. There are calls for similar protests in Kabul, where many women are waiting for the airport to open."}

The former president has died aged 90, after a long and illustrious political career which included a controversial return to politics, leading to a second term as US President and then as Governor of Texas. Here we look at the key figures in American politics during his presidency and how he was viewed by his fellow politicians. President George W. Bush was one of the most powerful figures in American politics during the George W. Bush presidency, but was controversially returned to politics in 2006 following his first term in office. He was elected Governor of Texas in 2001 to take over from Republican former Governor Dick Cheney, and was reelected to the governorship in 2006. Bush's controversial return to politics led to the first term as US President after he won election in 2004, after the Republican Party lost power to the Democrats. This was followed by a second term as US President in which he focused on bringing the country out of the financial crisis of 2007/8 and becoming a global force for peace and stability. The Republican Party lost control of the US Senate in 2010 to the Democrats, leading to a run-off election where Republican Senator John McCain was defeated. He led the Republican party to the 2012 elections and was elected President again, which was the first time in the party's history that the party had held power in the executive branch for more than four years. After the Iraq War, President Bush advocated for further military action, and took a leading role in the fight against terrorism and the War on Terror. He led the fight against terrorism until 2003, when he announced he would not seek re-election. He retired to painting after the Iraq War and was knighted in 2008 for services to his country, and was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during the... Bush first ran for US President in the 1988 election but failed to win. He won election as Governor of Texas in 2001 to become the first Republican to hold the office, following his election as Governor of the state in a special race in 2000. He was reelected to the governorship in 2006 and in 2010 won a third term, finishing his first term as governor in 2013 with the highest approval rating in Texas history. He is the second most popular governor in US history behind Democrat Bill Clinton and was the highest paid elected official in Texas history. President Bush led the Republican Party to re-election in 2012 and was elected for a record second term in 2014. He was re-elected to a third term in the 2016 elections. The former president was elected to the Senate from Texas in 1998 and served until 2010. He was also elected to the US House of Representatives in 1986."}

President Joe Biden was sworn in as president on Wednesday, and the price of gasoline is already at a record high. House Republican leaders have falsely blamed Joe Biden for the increase in the cost of gasoline. That is a misleading and disingenuous statement. The recent increase in gasoline prices is attributed to the rise in the value of the U.S. dollar, the Colonial Pipeline cyberattack, and not Biden's policies. Joe Biden is committed to the interests of all Americans, including those working hard to pay for our nation's transportation system.

President Trump, during an impromptu news conference at the White House, said that Donald Trump's former lawyer had asked him about witness testimony, allegedly in the form of money. Mr Trump's statement also included allegations of a conspiracy to undermine the integrity of the 2020 presidential election, and a call for new elections to fix the problem of election fraud. The announcement came on the heels of Mr Trump's firing of his own lawyer, Michael Cohen, for lying to Congress about payments to women who said that he had sex with them. The move has been described as the latest development in a saga of allegations against Mr Trump that began in 2016 and has left him on the defensive. On Tuesday, the House of Representatives impeached Mr Trump for the second time in the history of the U.S. Senate.

The Cuomo brothers have become a focus of controversy and debates about journalistic ethics and responsibility . Cuomo has been accused of sexual harassment by several former female colleagues and the NY AG Letitia James has accused Cuomo of abuse of power . CNN has a long history of covering scandalous stories involving the media and politics and is the first to report the allegations against Andrew Cuomo and Chris Cuomo is a proven news leader who knows what to say to move audiences to tears, laughs and to tears again. Chris Cuomo's role at the center of the Cuomo scandal is complex, but CNN's approach has not been to punish Cuomo. Rather, we're focusing on the bigger picture. While the Cuomo brothers are among the most closely watched figures in New York politics, Andrew Cuomo is facing impeachment for allegedly sexually harassing a number of former female staffers and for abuse of power. CNN has not disciplined Chris Cuomo, the governor's brother and a senior CNN news anchor in New York City. Why? Because there is a delicate balance in news stories between being able to get the story and allowing people who want to see the story to get to see the story. Andrew Cuomo is not a member of CNN's editorial board, but he is well-liked and respected by CNN staffers. Chris Cuomo has a proven track record of being able to move audiences emotionally. He's also respected by his colleagues and friends on the network. Chris Cuomo, like other news anchors, has to balance journalistic duties with family loyalty.

It said of those 11 cases, nine were under 30 and had received Moderna's Spikevax vaccine. But five of them were treated with corticosteroids, which is a treatment for inflammation. One of the cases involved a 20-year-old who received a shot on 1 February and died on 13 February. A case of myocarditis was confirmed three days after he died, MHRA figures show. The rest were treated with corticosteroids, which is a treatment for inflammation. The HAS statement said myocarditis had been reported in just 11 cases since 1 March. The other nine involved people over the age of 30 and had received the Comirnaty vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech. It has been used for those over 30 since 21 February. The EU regulator, the European medicines agency (EMA), approved Moderna's booster vaccine for all over 18s, six months after the second dose, on Wednesday. Pfizer's Comirnaty vaccine, which was approved for all over 18s in the UK last year, is the only vaccine to be licensed for over 30s."}

Some states are now offering their own stimulus payments, but others, including California, have decided not to do so The pandemic has seen an increase in housing and food insecurity in the US, partly due to the loss of employment caused by the shutdowns. Stimulus payments have been a crucial lifeline for many low income American families who are struggling with the crisis caused by the virus. The American public is not likely to receive another round of stimulus payments until 2021 at the earliest. There is no anticipation of a fourth round of federal stimulus payments for the general American public, US media outlet Forbes reports. Several states, including California, New York, New Mexico, Maryland, and Colorado, have already started offering their own stimulus payments, but others, including Texas, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Georgia, are not doing so. Lawmakers are focusing on other forms of financial support such as child tax credit payments rather than direct payments. Direct payments and relief programs have played a crucial role in mitigating housing and food insecurity during the pandemic.

January 6, the Capitol riot is the day in which America learned that Trump was a danger to democracy and the rule of law. And that a president who unrelentingly exploits societal divisions and abuses the rule of law cannot stay in office. The nation is now divided. The GOP is divided and the Trump presidency is divided. That's why, as the nation faces its greatest crisis in four years, we must hold Donald Trump accountable. This is the year when America will experience the most divisive presidential election in a decade. And if Trump loses, then he will be responsible for that. President Trump should be impeached for inciting a riot that saw five die and the speaker of the House of Representatives and a senior House Democrat were assaulted. It's time to end Trump's dangerous presidency and move on. It's been nearly two years since the January 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, a violent protest against the election result led by Donald Trump supporters. As the nation prepares to cast its ballots on Nov. 3, 2020, we look back at the history of the riots that led to Trump's impeachment and at why impeachment is needed. Trump tweeted that he would \"walk out of the White House\" after being impeached, but that was not the case. In the weeks that followed, Trump continued to claim his innocence, insisting that he was being unfairly slandered. He also tweeted a series of tweets that stated that there would be chaos during the election on Nov. 3 if he were to lose. In light of the riots on January 6, Trump tweeted on Jan. 20 that \"there will be NO violence whatsoever\" at the polls. Since then, Trump has said that he won the election and that \"we were the ones who started the riots.\" He even tweeted that his supporters will \"take\" the election if he loses. After the riots on January 6, a number of Trump supporters took to social media to share their thoughts about the riots, the president, and the future of the country.

The service outage was attributable to human error, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said . Facebook said it suffered a series of maintenance failures during the outage . Some experts and users were quick to speculate that the outage was caused by military action, as rumors spread online . (CNN) -- You might have seen online that the military raided Facebook and caused the service to briefly halt on Oct. 4. The claim is a hoax and Facebook was forced to deny it. This was the company's most serious data center outage in years, according to a statement from Mark Zuckerberg on the company's blog on Oct. 5: \"We're all still shaking our heads and processing that this was the worst outage we have ever seen,\" he said. \"We were lucky to get through another day.\" If Mark Zuckerberg were to die in a car crash, CNN would say, \"Lucky he didn't have a job to do today,\" and we would be right. The real reason why Facebook was down was because we are human and we make mistakes. We know what the damage we have done to millions of users was terrible, but we want to make clear that we are here to fix it. We are working hard every day to fix it . Most of the outage happened when Facebook attempted to migrate data from servers running on older technology to newer technology. The migration took longer than expected, which is why many users may not have been able to log in to the service for six hours. When the migration was complete, Facebook restored data and services. The company said it had restored 99% of the service. The migration may have caused the outage. As for the military raid theory: It was a hoax; it originated with a Twitter user claiming that he had seen U.S. military personnel trying to take down the site, but he later retracted that claim . The military raided Facebook? That's a hoax, and it started on Twitter, according to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. (CNN) -- A six-hour outage on Facebook and Instagram and WhatsApp appeared to be the result of military action, but it was not the case, the company said Monday. Mark Zuckerberg said on Facebook's blog that the problem was caused by \"human error during routine maintenance\" and promised the company would fix it. The outage occurred on Oct. 4, Mark Zuckerberg told CNN, when Facebook attempted to migrate data from servers running on older technology to newer technology. \"It was a very difficult migration and it required a large amount of work to complete,\" Zuckerberg said at the time. \"We'd like to apologize to all of those affected by this,\" the company said in a statement."}

Amanda Schaller . In a first, the House voted to impeach President Trump for a second time on Monday, making it the most bipartisan impeachment in history. Reps. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) and Tom Rice (R-Ariz.) cast the decisive votes to convict the Republican president. The vote came despite the high level of polarization . Trump has only been impeached once in the past century: In 1868, he was impeached for refusing to cede control of the government to congressional Democrats . House Democrats accused Trump of abusing his powers as president to undermine the political process, including by pressuring Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and interfering with the investigation into his associates . In a statement Monday night, Cheney called the impeachment a threat to the democratic process and said she would consider a censure vote on the president if he were to be removed from power. Rice called for Trump to be stripped of the office 'at the outset' of the new impeachment trial. Both said they would vote against Trump if they were to face the choice before the Senate . The vote is historic due to the high level of polarization and the usual party-line nature of past impeachments. It will also push the president to the right as the GOP holds an overwhelming majority in the Senate, making him harder to remove from office. Previous impeachments displayed almost no cross-party support . The impeachment votes were largely symbolic - with only 10 Republican members voting for it and 197 opposing Trump. This time, however, 11 GOP senators voted to convict the president, including Trump's top ally, Mike Pence . A look at some of the most notable moments of the impeachment vote .

The incidents have taken place over the past two weeks in and around Waterford, in the Detroit suburb of Pontiac, police said. These charges stem from threats made online and at school, including one case in which children as young as 9 allegedly wrote a threatening letter to their high school principal, according to police. Two of those accused of creating threatening letters, both 9, were detained Thursday, police said, the Detroit News reported Friday. Police in the Pontiac suburb of Oxford arrested a 10-year-old boy and a 14-year-old girl on Friday for allegedly making threats against schools. Both were in detention pending an arraignment, police in the suburb of Pontiac said. In Waterford, four students who have been accused of making serious threats against schools were taken into custody Thursday and Friday, Michigan State Police said. They were all in the eighth grade and nine years old. School officials in Oxford said they would not comment on the arrests and detention of students, but they noted that the school district is working closely with law enforcement and the courts to help those accused. The threat of violence against schools has become rampant in the nation recently, and some of the incidents have led authorities to detain students in the hope that they will rethink their actions and reconsider their threats. In metro Detroit, a total of two dozen students have been arrested and charged in recent days, according to authorities. Many of the threats against schools in Michigan appear to have been based on incidents of copycat violence against schools elsewhere in the U.S., according to officials. Authorities are warning parents that their children may face consequences if they carry out threats against schools even in jest."}

That's why I'm writing to urge you not to nominate Donald Trump for the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize. This is not my first call on you, nor will be my last. I am grateful that you are listening. It is the responsibility of the next president to ensure that every American has access to the healthcare he or she needs to lead a fulfilled life, regardless of age, race, income level, gender identity, sexual preference, or disability. This will not happen if Trump remains in office. As someone who worked closely with Powell in the 1990s, when it was clear that Donald Trump did not understand the power of the presidency, I have known for some time that Trump would be a terrible president. I have also known that Powell was not the kind of person to let such things slide. The most damning of Powell's mistakes was the decision to leave the Oval Office when Colin Powell was about to be shot on the orders of Trump. If you nominate Trump for the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize, you would be sending a clear signal that he should not be allowed to run for office in the future.

It marked the deadliest U.S. military action in the war. The bombing was the culmination of months of intense diplomatic and military negotiations between the United States and the Taliban, culminating in the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan on December 29, 2001. In the aftermath of that invasion, the U.S. military fought the Taliban and other warlords, establishing a military presence throughout the country that has remained consistent since. Despite U.S. and Afghan leaders repeatedly warning the public that the airport could be bombed, many people still decided to cross the border into Pakistan for fear of attacks. After the bombing, many of the casualties were left in the Afghan refugee camps. We hear about their lives from Afghan journalists and members of the U.S. military, and from U.S. officials. We hope these stories will remind us to keep fighting the war, and never give up hope that a better future is possible. On this day last year, many U.S. service members and Afghan civilians lost their lives as a result of an airstrike at Kabul International Airport.

The proposal includes a second round of $2,000 stimulus checks, up to a total of $350 billion over the course of 2020 and 2021. US: Senate Democrats agree on another $2,000 stimulus checks for Americans A Senate Democrats leader says the plan will help struggling Americans from the pandemic The proposed legislation will make its way to President Joe Biden, who has previously said $2,000 would be the minimum amount that should be sent to Americans. The stimulus checks are part of a $15 billion package that includes $600 billion in relief measures and an extra $350 billion in direct payments to struggling Americans. At the end of last year, Democrats proposed $1.9tn in spending and an additional $1.3tn in taxes to pay for the measures, while Republicans offered a $900bn stimulus package. Senate Democrats say the new money will help individuals and families struggling during the pandemic and that businesses will not have to pay a new $300bn tax. This is the second coronavirus relief bill to pass through the Senate, with the first bill passing earlier this month. Senate Democrats are expected to take over the Senate in January with a majority, so they can push the bill through even faster than if it passed through the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives passed the second round of stimulus checks in late December, but Senate Republicans voted to delay the legislation and the bill did not pass until last month."}

Powell had a unique combination of military and political power, and it is this combination that led him to make some highly controversial decisions in his time as US Secretary of State, for example in the case of the Iraq War. Colin Powell was secretary of state of the United States in the 1990s. Powell took over as the first black secretary of state under President Bill Clinton's administration, and enjoyed a quick rise to become a four-star general and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. But the former general had to decide whether to invade Iraq, a decision that contradicted the very principle that he had promoted for decades - that the US military should not intervene in other people's domestic politics. Powell doctrine: The Colin Powell doctrine, also known as the 'Powell doctrine', is a policy on foreign intervention that has been popularised by his son Michael, who has published a collection of his father's writings. Here is a summary of Colin Powell's life, and the controversy that marked it. Colin Powell was the first black US secretary of state under Bill Clinton, and one of the most powerful men in Washington D.C.\n\nHe became known for controversial decisions, including invading Iraq to quell what he saw as a threat to US homeland security. But Powell, a retired four-star general who served two terms as a US senator and was a member of the House and Senate armed services committees for decades, also earned the nickname \"Blond Bomber\" for his ability to fly bombers without wearing a oxygen mask.\n\nColin Powell enjoyed fixing things. He loved to repair cars and had a garage in his back yard.\n\nBut in the end, Powell's decision to invade Iraq in 2003 did not go uncontroversial. Colin Powell's role in the Iraq War was so pivotal that he came to be regarded as the grandfather of the doctrine of foreign intervention, and was credited with laying the foundations for the US intervention in Afghanistan in 2001.\n\nHere are some of his lesser-known, but equally important, contributions to US foreign policy.\n\nPowell was first black US secretary of state.

Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said that Colonial Pipeline is \"a cybersecurity risk to the U.S.,\" and said she is concerned about the company's lack of \"adequate cybersecurity measures\" to protect against such threats. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., asked Blount about why Colonial paid the hackers the equivalent of $700,000 in ransom, saying the payment was \"risky and costly to the company\" and not reflective of the company's commitment to cybersecurity. In a follow-up statement, the company said it did not pay the ransom, and that it had no plan to prevent future attacks. Read the full transcript of Blount's testimony . Colonial paid cyberattackers $700,000 in ransom . Cyberattack began in mid-December . Senators worried about company's lack of a ransomware prevention plan and its decision to pay the ransom ."}

So what is known about her death? And what do we need to know about her homicide investigation? While authorities are investigating the death of Brian Laundrie, a man who died along with Petito on July 2, 2019, it is unclear what caused his death. Officials said the body was found by volunteers in Myakkahatchee Creek Environmental Park, Florida, located in Ocala, the weekend after Petito died. Petito and Laundrie had fallen overboard from a boat, according to Florida State police. Petito was pronounced dead at a hospital the next day. But what was the cause of Laundrie's death, and what led to his death along with Petito? Legal experts have argued that the laws surrounding homicide in Florida are vague—which is why it is difficult to determine who is responsible for the death of the couple. One of the most troubling questions surrounding Petito's homicide is the role of third parties, including family and friends. Laundrie is the second murder victim to be identified in the case. The first was David Rosen, who worked as an assistant to the sheriff's office in Florida. Rosen's parents were able to identify his body in June 2020 and have since filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against the sheriff's office. But the case against sheriff's officials is still pending. Some legal experts believe that the couple may have been involved in an intimate relationship, but it is unclear if it was consensual or not. In a short statement sent out by the sheriff's office, a spokesman said that Laundrie and Petito had been \"friends\" for several months. While authorities are still investigating the cause of Laundrie's death, many questions remain unanswered regarding Petito's homicide. Here is a summary: An investigation into the murder of Gabby Petito in Florida has uncovered the remains of a man who died along with her in a boat on July 2, 2019. Authorities are still unsure of the cause of his death, but some legal experts believe it may have been in addition to her drowning, according to NBC News. The man was found in Myakkahatchee Creek Environmental Park in Ocala, Florida, the weekend after Petito died. The sheriff's office said the couple had fallen overboard from a boat and Petito was pronounced dead the next day. Brian Laundrie's death will no doubt be a major factor in the upcoming trial of petty officer Darren Wilson, the police officer who fired seven shots at 23-year-old Petito in April 2018. The trial is set to begin in August."}

Joe Biden's inauguration turned into a huge political mess when protesters stormed the Capitol on Wednesday night, demanding the president step down for failing to take action against the coronavirus pandemic. In the chaos that ensued, Lady Gaga took to her social media account to post a message to her fans: 'Thank you so much and be safe. We love you,' the pop star wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. Joe Biden joked on Twitter that he had a pretty good time at Joe Biden's inauguration after he was greeted with an angry mob of protesters who claimed he had not done enough to help the country deal with the coronavirus pandemic. 'It wasn't much fun,' he told reporters on Wednesday. 'But I still got to say thank you to all of you who came out to the inauguration.' Campbell was chosen to help because of his stature and professionalism to avoid any potential embarrassment."}

A massive storm tore a roof off a Houma hospital on Monday night, flooding the hospital's surgical floor and leaving patients lying in pools of water . The storm hit south Louisiana as a COVID-19 surge forced the evacuation of thousands of people, including many patients from the Houma Leonard J. Chabert Medical Center. The storm took a massive toll on the city, particularly on health workers. The Houma hospital has been operating since 1870, but it was not ready for this type of storm . The hospital, which is undergoing a major renovation and expansion, was already overwhelmed by the number of COVID-19 patients it received as the devastating virus swept through Houma and other parts of the state. At the time of the storm, the medical center was already running on its last reserves of water because of the thousands of patients it was processing at the same time as its overflowing COVID-19 patients. \"It was more than just a hurricane,\" said hospital's CEO, Jay Smith. \"It felt like a very long, heavy weight was on my shoulders.\" The hospital was not prepared for the kind of storm it encountered on Monday night. In the initial stages of the storm, water started to pour down from the hospital's roof, the CEO said. By the time the flood was under control, it had soaked the medical center's surgical floor and left patients lying in puddles of water. As the storm progressed, Smith said the hospital's patients were evacuated and discharged to other hospitals in the region, as they could not be risked being evacuated back to their flooded rooms.

In less than 12 months, he and his administration have had more than their share of controversies, but the most significant have been the impeachment proceedings against him, which led to his removal from office, and the coronavirus pandemic, which led to the first economic shutdown of U.S. history. With that said, there have been plenty of other things to talk about during his final months in office, so here are the five biggest stories that have dominated the news during his presidency. 1. Impeachment proceedings led to Trump's removal from office After the first debate, Trump's campaign repeatedly claimed the results had been rigged and he would win the election by a landslide if it were decided based on votes from the popular vote, rather than the electoral college. In October 2016, Donald Trump was elected president in the first U.S. presidential election in a generation to be decided by vote from the electoral college, which is based on votes from each state. In January 2017, the Republican took office after winning 270 electoral college votes over his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. During his final months in office, Trump was removed from office twice for breaching U.S. impeachment proceedings. He was charged with obstructing Congress, which led to him being impeached for the second time in December 2019, and a third time in February 2020. Both times he was found guilty of the offence, and the House of Representatives voted to send his case to the Senate, where he faces a second trial. 2. Coronavirus outbreak led to the first economic shutdown of U.S. history On March 27, 2020, President Trump declared the U.S. was at a public health emergency due to coronavirus and called on people to stay at home. The order came three days after the first person in the U.S. tested positive for the virus. By March 30, more than 25,000 people in the U.S. had tested positive for the virus, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. By May, nearly 1 million people in the U.S. had tested positive for the virus and the U.S. had become the worst-hit country by number of cases. In April, the first death due to coronavirus was reported in the U.S. The number of cases in the U.S. increased by more than 600% by the end of April and more than 300% by the end of May. 3. Trump's successor Joe Biden was inaugurated on January 20 On January 20, Joe Biden was inaugurated as the 46th U.S. president. The inauguration was the first to be held without Trump in the White House for nearly 20 years."}

His death will be felt by all Americans and his legacy will be remembered for decades to come. Powell was a former Secretary of State and U.S. Army General who served his country faithfully, with courage and bravery. Colin Powell was born in 1937, and was well known for breaking down barriers with his military and diplomatic accomplishments as a U.S. General and Secretary of State. He is also remembered for being a role model for young Americans of all backgrounds. Powell was an inspiring force behind the Army Cadet Command, which is based at Fort Knox. Today, the United States Army Cadet Command continues to grow in influence and recognition around the world. He was known as a mentor for the U.S. Army's cadet corps, as well as for Cadets of other armed forces across the world. In particular, he inspired the cadets of Fort Leavenworth to pursue careers in the U.S. Army, as well as the U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force. Powell was one of the most recognized people in the world, and he will be greatly missed by all who know him. The U.S. Army Cadet Command is a part of Fort Knox and is responsible for education, leadership, and leadership development for the Cadet Corps. The cadet corps continues to grow in influence and recognition around the world, and the influence of the Army Cadet Command is evident across the country and around the world. While Colin Powell's accomplishments were remarkable, his greatest legacy will be his influence on cadets of the Army, Navy, and Air Force around the world, and what he taught them to do. Powell served as an Army General for over 20 years, and was the first U.S. general to be awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and the Distinguished Service medal. He also served as the U.S. Secretary of State for 9 years, making him one of the longest serving Secretaries of State in U.S."}

This is the third winter storm that has hit Texas in the space of a month, and has been named the most extreme to hit the state in more than a decade. It will also push the average temperature below freezing for the first time in nearly six decades, though not to as low as the winter of 1969-70. The rolling blackouts were announced Tuesday morning by the Southwest Power Pool, which oversees the distribution of electricity across Texas, Oklahoma, and some parts of Mexico. The Southwest Power Pool said Texas had no choice but to shut its main transmission lines, which account for more than two-thirds of the state's electricity production, in response to the severe winter storm. \"The power grid is down and we cannot restore power quickly enough to meet demand,\" Power Pool executive vice president and president of Texas, Paul Menchaca, told reporters. \"We're working as hard as we can, but we can't restore power on demand at this point.\" More than two million people were left in the dark across Texas, according to the power company Entergy. While the rolling blackouts caused some economic disruption for businesses, most of the impact came down to inconvenience for customers. \"It's going to take days, probably a week, for us not to be able to turn on our heaters. It's going to be cold, and it's going to be hard, but we've got to go through it,\" Travis County, Texas, fire chief Mike Smith said. The severe weather system that has hit Texas and parts of Oklahoma resulted in more than 3,000 power outages, with 2 million people in Texas without power Tuesday . The Texas Energy Office said the cold spell is the second-deepest recorded in the state . The severe weather system will lead to the lowest temperatures in Texas in more than half a century . Some 1 million people were affected by the severe weather system in the Southwest Power Pool system, which includes Texas, Oklahoma and parts of Mexico . More than 3,000 power outages were reported in Texas and over 3 million people were without power in Oklahoma . The severe weather system has led to the lowest temperatures ever recorded in Texas ."}

A former presidential candidate, Powell is the first Black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a position he filled when President Ronald Reagan was in office. Powell said his decision to join Trump's presidential campaign was an attempt to oppose the Republican Party, which he said had become too extreme. Powell wrote a series of letters to the Washington Post in 2015 in which he expressed his concerns about the direction the Republican Party was taking under Donald Trump's leadership, and about the way the Trump administration had damaged U.S. democracy. Donald Trump's response: Donald Trump hit back at Colin L. Powell's column, denigrating his career, praising himself and referring to his opponent as a criminal. In the column, Powell said that Trump's response to the violence that broke out in the U.S. during the 2016 campaign was more important than whether he won the election. A former presidential candidate, Colin L. Powell served as the first Black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff when President Ronald Reagan was in office.

The controversial law passed in October requires social media sites to remove content at authorities' request and maintain a legal presence in Turkey. Twitter has been banned from advertising on Turkish social media platforms on Thursday, as it failed to comply with a new Turkish law that requires them to have a legal representative in the country. The new law is designed to give Turkish regulators control over what is posted on social media sites, where the government could order them to remove certain content at the behest of the authorities. According to the media regulator, a Turkish court ruled Thursday that Twitter and Pinterest could not be allowed to continue advertising on the platforms in Turkey until the firms comply with the new Turkish law, which was passed in October of this year. Twitter and Pinterest were ordered to comply with the new Turkish law as soon as possible, and Twitter has been forced to ban the types of ads that are being used in Turkey on Thursday. The new Turkish advertising ban on Twitter, Pinterest and other social media sites was implemented on Wednesday and was meant to be enforced as soon as possible, as Turkish regulators said that the social media companies needed to comply with the law.

But with the economy improving and unemployment claims down sharply, it looks increasingly unlikely that Congress or President Trump will give Americans a fourth stimulus check at this time. The White House released its weekly unemployment claims report on Tuesday and indicated the number of Americans claiming unemployment insurance fell by 2.2 million in August, the highest drop since April. While that is a much bigger drop than the 12.7 million who applied for unemployment in August, it is still only 12% of the total number of Americans unemployed during the same month. While the economy appears to be getting back in gear, many are still craving a second stimulus check from the White House or Congress to help pay their bills. That's why over 2.8 million Americans have signed a petition for a $2,000 monthly stimulus payment that would be paid out for three months in a row. \"We need this now,\" Change.org petition creator Stephanie Bonin told USA Today. \"We are at a critical time, and it's so important to make sure the stimulus checks get in to the hands of those most in need.\" Bonin pointed out the importance of getting the stimulus check to the people who need it most. In the United States, 2 million more people applied for unemployment insurance in August than in July. Bonin said the reason for the jump is because many Americans had to stop working to care for elderly family members or sick family members during the pandemic."}

Cuomo, a longtime friend and ally of governor Andrew Cuomo (D-NY), was a key adviser for his brother on his campaign. Now, Cuomo and his CNN team are facing a barrage of criticism from fellow New York journalism experts over their role in the scandal involving Governor Andrew Cuomo's brother's role in the governor's office. Cuomo says he will remain with the CNN program despite calls from other New York to fire him. Cuomo and his office have said they were not present at the time any wrongdoing was being discussed. He said his brother's decision to step down as the head of New York's emergency services had nothing to do with the news show. Cuomo is also under fire from media watchdogs and others for the way in which he has portrayed the governor's brother, Andrew Cuomo. Northeastern University experts say that Chris Cuomo and CNN's management team are responsible for the blurred lines that have been drawn between Cuomo's personal and professional life. Cuomo has said his news show is about New York, but many observers think the show is more about Cuomo himself."}

Cybercriminals are increasingly targeting companies around the world to steal data, collect a ransom, and spread the malware to other systems.\n\nCybersecurity experts say that companies around the world have been targeted with ransomware in recent years, and last month a major attack highlighted the potential threat ransomware poses to national security and to the economy.\n\nOn March 30, hackers encrypted data at Colonial Pipeline and demanded a ransom of $850,000, or $1.2 million in bitcoin. Security experts say that the $1.2 million was the maximum the company could afford. Even that amount was considered too much for most companies. But the company did comply and paid.\n\nNow, a study conducted by the Ponemon Institute for Cybersecurity suggests that ransomware could cost businesses $16 billion in 2016. This is a jump from the estimated $11.3 billion spent in 2015. The study also found that the amount of ransom paid out by businesses has risen exponentially over the past few years.\n\nThe Ponemon study, which looked at more than 1,700 companies, found that 50 percent of the victims of ransomware attacks in 2016 paid a ransom. The average amount a company paid in ransom last year was estimated at about $312,000. But the report found that the actual average amount paid out was $640,000, and that the average number of days to recover data was about 4.5 days.\n\nCybersecurity expert Dr. David Krebs, author of the Ponemon study and professor at the University of Minnesota, said it was not surprising the average amount paid was higher than the amount paid last year. The reasons for the higher amount were not clear, he said. \"It's always interesting to know what makes people decide to pay,\" Krebs said.\n\nThe Ponemon Institute for Cybersecurity also looked at ransomware attacks on government networks. That category included schools, government agencies, hospitals, and other health care facilities, as well as banks and financial institutions. Of that group, Ponemon found that the average amount paid out in ransom was about $262,000. But the average number of days to recover data was just 2.4 days. The study also found that the amount of ransomware paid out by government networks was the lowest of the three groups.\n\nPonemon found that the most common method of payment was bitcoin, which was used in about a third of ransomware attacks it studied. About a third of attacks also required payment in cash, and about a quarter used credit cards.\n\nPonemon's study found that..."}

But what impact will the bill have on the finances of US families? The US Senate passed its third stimulus bill, which contains a $1,400 per adult and $600 per child check. But will this have any effect on household financial stability? This is an analysis of how the new stimulus package will impact households. By John CampbellBusiness and finance editor, Morning Consult As a journalist writing about the economy, I find the focus of political debate and economic commentary on the third stimulus bill to be a bit of a surprise. While the overall size and timing of the bill is good, the lack of data on the impact on households' ability to pay their bills has been striking, as have some of the policy suggestions contained in the bill. When the US Senate passed its first $2 trillion bill in 2009, the debate raged for months over the impact on household finances and consumer spending, including the role of student loans and the potential impact of the massive tax cut. Of course we all liked it when the student loans were forgiven, but that is not the point. What is interesting to note is that when we looked at the financial situation of US families, we saw that it was not the most popular bill, despite the amount it was spent. This is because at that time, there was limited data on the financial situation of US families. This time around, there has been even more focus on the impact of the stimulus package on consumer spending. That is a bit of a surprise, in my view, given that traditional economic data like the GDP and consumer spending data do not provide a full picture of the distribution of savings among the US population. So let's look at the data from one of the most comprehensive sources we have - Morning Consult. It tracks all aspects of the US household finances and its tracking data includes all three stimulus packages in addition to all of the other economic policies in the past 20 years. So let's look at the distribution of savings among the US households. We looked at two different scenarios: first, let's assume we are on a recovery, with the economy growing and consumer spending rising, and second, let's look at an economic downturn. So let's assume that we are on a recovery, with the economy growing and... 1. This time around, there has been even more focus on the impact of the stimulus package on consumer spending.

A heavily armed white man was arrested for killing two black men and wounding a third man.\n\nThe verdict has elicited polarized reactions, with right-wing groups and the National Rifle Association celebrating, and liberal leaders expressing concerns over vigilantism.\n\nHowever, what the case reveals is a deep rift in U.S. society that will not be easily fixed. It has touched on divisive issues like gun rights, police brutality, and racial injustice. It has also highlighted the deep divides between liberal and conservative views on how to respond to violence.\n\nThe case has also sparked an interesting debate about the meaning of self-defense. Rittenhouse, 18, claimed self-defense after fatally shooting two men and wounding a third during protests in Kenosha on Aug. 21. The men were in a crowd of people demonstrating against the police and protesting the fatal shooting of Jacob Blake, a black man, by a white police officer. Supporters of the shooting said it was justified, but many liberal leaders were critical of Rittenhouse.\n\nSupporters of Kyle Rittenhouse, right, who killed two black protesters and wounded a policeman in Kenosha, Wisconsin, claim that he was justified in his actions.\n\nRittenhouse was convicted last week of manslaughter in the deaths and is now accused of a hate crime in the police shooting of Jacob Blake.

It's just one in a long list of fake pictures circulated on the internet following a major disruption to the Suez Canal on March 23. This morning we learned that after the Ever Given had been released from its position on the canal, it began its usual route. So it's important to remember that while this photo is a plausible depiction of the Ever Given cargo ship's route before it was caught in the Suez Canal, the ship's route hasn't always been as it is now. So what was the actual route of the Ever Given? Was the ship intended to be drawn in the way that the photo appears to be? Was the route intended to resemble a crude drawing of a penis? First things first: a picture is worth a thousand words, but this one isn't worth too much. The image is genuine and shows the same route as the ship has always taken before it was stuck in the Suez Canal. That means the following things.\n\nThe image depicts the full route of the Ever Given cargo ship from the start of its usual route, through the Suez Canal, out to the shipyard that it was built at in the Port of Mombasa. It was drawn in exactly the same way as the route is now, with the lines drawn in the same scale as the lines on the physical map. It does not resemble a drawing of a penis. And, importantly, it is not a drawing of the route that was taken by the Ever Given when it got caught in the Suez Canal.\n\nIt's worth pointing out that the photo was posted to Twitter by the ship's owner, but not by the company that ran the Suez Canal, nor by the company that owns the ship. While the photo is true, there's nothing to suggest it was meant to look like a crude drawing of a penis. It was not the intention to draw the route of the ship in this way. What's next\n\nThe Ever Given was released from its position on the canal on Monday, March 23, and the usual route has been taken since.

In the wake of the recent shooting at the 'Rust' movie set, the Hollywood Reporter spoke with an armorer who has been working on films since the '30s to get a sense of how things really work. The author explains that there are multiple layers of safety in place on the movie set to keep shooters and their equipment safe, including using only real guns and dummy rounds that look like actual bullets. The author also provides a description of how revolvers and blank rounds work on set, including safety protocols for using dummy rounds\n\nThe 'Rust' shooting is described as incredibly tragic by many on set, including the head of the UCLA Film School\n\nThis week's shooting at the 'Rust' movie studios left a cinematographer dead and injured director Joel Souza. While the circumstances of the shooting were not yet fully clear at the time of publication, the Hollywood Reporter spoke to an armorer who has been working on films since the '30s, and who has more than a dozen years experience with Hollywood sets, to further clarify the shooters' use of deadly weapons and the safety protocols that exist on the film sets. As the 'Rust' shooting occurred, Joel Souza was working behind the scenes filming for the new movie 'Call Me by Your Name,' when a gunshot was fired at him. The actor was able to get back on set, but shortly after that, a shotgun was fired, injuring him and forcing his character in the movie to fall unconscious. While the shooting was happening, Hutchins, also from the 'Rust' movie studio, was filming in front of the set and taking photos of the shooters movements, dead body, and the gunshots, according to an email from Hutchins' publicist. When the incident occurred, Souza was not there to see the shootings, and the first person he saw was the first responders to the scene. Souza was able to get back on the set and continued filming. After the shooting, however, the head of the UCLA Film School said he felt the death of the cinematographer on 'Rust' to have been tragic, even though he felt the movie had some things in common with 'Apocalypse Now,' according to the Hollywood Reporter.

It will also be one of the most important for the Rams, if they are able to overcome the adversity caused by the recent trade that cost them their first-round pick in the 2016 NFL Draft. It is one of the most intriguing matchups of the 2015 NFL season. Tampa Bay has been one of the most impressive teams in recent years, winning two straight Super Bowls — the first time for any team in NFL history to do so. Meanwhile, the LA Rams have been inconsistent, losing four of their last five games, including three to the New England Patriots and the Pittsburgh Steelers. It has been a hard time for the LA Rams, with a major disappointment in their most recent trade, losing their first-round pick to the Pittsburgh Steelers in the 2016 NFL Draft. Before the 2015 NFL season started, it looked as if the Los Angeles Rams would be a team that would challenge the New England Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers for championships. However, the Los Angeles Rams are a struggling team. They won one of their first five games of the 2015 NFL season by defeating the New England Patriots, but the remainder of their season has been a struggle. This matchup will be the third of the season between the two quarterbacks, the second to be played at Levi's Stadium. In the first two meetings between the two teams, neither of the teams won. The first meeting took place in Super Bowl XLVIII, where the Tampa Bay Bucs beat the LA Rams 38-24, led by Tom Brady. The second encounter was in Super Bowl XLIX, where the LA Rams held the Tampa Bay Bucs to a 14-14 tie, with both teams scoring 24 points in the third quarter of the game. The Los Angeles Rams were a disappointing team in 2015, losing four of their last five games. The Rams will want to turn things around in their next game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, despite having lost their first-round pick in the 2016 NFL draft. Matthew Stafford has struggled in recent games against the Tampa Bay Bucs."}

In a settlement announced by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on Tuesday night, Griddy Energy is to pay $2.5 million in damages to customers that received very high electricity bills during the storm. The bill was caused when the company offered consumers a 'wholesale electricity rate' to pay for high-priced power generated by the company's own nuclear plants. The agency sued the company after thousands of customers complained about bills ranging from $2,000 to $13,000. \"This settlement marks an important step forward in the fight to hold energy suppliers accountable,\" Attorney General Paxton said.

As the nation's second-highest-ranking Hispanic, and the first female president-elect, Joe Biden chose Harris in hopes that she could help turn the focus away from managing border security issues, and toward addressing the root causes of migration from Central America, which is often driven by poverty and economic opportunity, and the political instability that often accompanies it. \"It is important for us to focus on the root causes of migration, rather than managing the southern border,\" Harris told ABC News. \"Poverty is a big factor, and instability in these countries is a huge factor.\" While Biden's team is preparing to head to Mexico and Guatemala next week, the former California senator is worried about political entanglement in any immigration policy discussions with Mexican officials. Critics from the Republican majority have accused Joe Biden's team, led by Harris, of turning their back on the country to work on border issues. \"They have turned their backs on the nation and are focused on dealing with the border,\" Sen.

The Suez Canal blockade highlighted vulnerabilities in global supply chains and the importance of crisis management plans. The recovery from such crisis requires a detailed plan including goals, tasks, timeframes, required resources, and stakeholders to be notified. Peter Deans, an expert on contingency plans and supply chains, shares his view on the crisis and discusses how businesses should plan for contingency. There are a number of reasons why businesses should have contingency plans for various scenarios in their supply chains, from transportation disruption to supply shortages to weather events. The following are examples where companies may want to create a contingency plan for an event in their supply chain. Businesses should work with their suppliers to create a contingency plan for a supply shortages scenario. To do so, they will need to know what happens during normal events, what happens during a supply event, what will happen during a contingency event, and how they are going to work together to avoid the contingency event. The contingency plan will then outline how the company's suppliers will work together to avoid the contingency scenario. Businesses should also work with their customers to create a contingency plan for a transportation disruption scenario.

There is no doubt Donald Trump will lose his presidency on the first count, which is abuse of office. But his lawyers have had to work hard to try to convince senators that they have not lost their sense of fairness or impartiality. Trump's lawyers say he was acting within the limits of the constitution in firing Comey as FBI director, in firing his generals and in imposing travel restrictions on foreign nationals in the US. But they will be looking to add a third count: that the impeachment process was unconstitutional. So why do 43 Republican senators vote to convict President Trump? They believe that what the House Managers did not do was establish a clear and present danger to the national security, or that the conduct of Trump had been so egregious that impeachment was the only way forward. The question is why are 43 Republican senators in the Senate voting not to convict Trump? They believe that what the House Managers did not do was establish a clear and present danger to the national security, or that the conduct of Trump had been so egregious that impeachment was the only way forward. Senator Rand Paul said that Trump is a \"very dangerous\" person, but that the Trump administration is \"very much alive\", so he has no choice but to vote not to impeach Trump. Why are 43 Republican senators not in favour of convicting Trump? They believe the conduct of Trump is not so egregious that impeachment is the only way forward."}

More than that, he has been acquitted of killing three people at a protest in October 2020.\n\nThat doesn't mean Kyle Rittenhouse is out of the woods, but it does mean that the trial that led to his convictions, which featured impassioned testimony by his lawyer and emotional testimony by himself, is not going to get repeated anytime soon.\n\nAfter the three-year standoff, this week the Wisconsin court decided to set aside the trial verdict because the jury acquitted Kyle Rittenhouse of killing three people at a Kenosha, Wis., protest, according to court documents obtained by the Wisconsin State Journal.\n\nThe court also dismissed all charges against Rittenhouse and released him from prison.\n\nThe trial verdict was overturned because of the jury's refusal to accept Kyle Rittenhouse's testimony during the trial, which he described as emotional.\n\nIt was something different from what occurred during the three-day trial of the former outlaw biker, which was called a miscarriage of justice by the defense attorney for Kyle Rittenhouse.\n\nWisconsin Gov. Tony Evers has called on the Wisconsin State Journal to publish the verdicts, saying they could lead to an investigation of the Kenosha Police Department's conduct of the original investigation. Rittenhouse's lawyer also said that he was confident his client would be acquitted again, and now that Kyle Rittenhouse is no longer under criminal arrest, it's time for him to get a fair trial. \"He's been proven wrong, and I think he's going to go through this process, and he's going to get his day in court,\" Kyle Rittenhouse's lawyer, Mark Feldman, said in September. In it, the 18-year-old was depicted as a hero, receiving praise from singer-songwriter Ted Nugent and right-wing gun-rights activists. In an interview with Fox 5, Nugent said Kyle Rittenhouse \"showed the true face of the white supremacy and the white nationalist\" in Kenosha, Wis. \"It's a pretty good day for Rittenhouse,\" he said. Nugent also told the station that he was confident Kyle would be exonerated. \"I hope not, but I know there's no reason he shouldn't,\" Nugent said.

Kyle Rittenhouse has pleaded not guilty to three charges of first-degree murder, manslaughter and a fourth charge of criminal mischief . Rittenhouse remains in the Kenosha Police Department after his arrest on Dec. 1 . A judge has ruled against the defense request to have a use-of-force expert testify at trial . The hearing at the Kenosha Circuit Court was set for Oct. 21 . Rittenhouse is accused of killing two people and injuring an additional three during a mob attack . (CNN) A judge denied a request by the defense Tuesday to have a use-of-force expert testify at trial for Kyle Rittenhouse, the 17-year-old accused of killing two people and injuring three others during a mob attack in Kenosha, Wis., last month. Prosecutors asked that the expert examine Rittenhouse's handling of the weapons used in the incident, including an officer's gun, as evidence in the case against the teenager. The request was denied Tuesday in a brief ruling by Kenosha County Circuit Judge Bruce Schroeder. Rittenhouse has pleaded not guilty to three charges of first-degree murder, manslaughter and a fourth charge of criminal mischief . Schroeder said prosecutors must submit a written request in a pretrial hearing on Oct. 21 to show how to prove Rittenhouse's motive. The case against him will start on Nov. 1. Authorities said Kyle Rittenhouse fired several rounds at people during a mob attack last month, killing one man and injuring two women . At the time of the attack, the Rittenhouse Police Department was preparing to defend itself in response to a white supremacist rally that was being held in downtown Kenosha. The officers were defending themselves and their equipment, prosecutors said. The Kenosha County Circuit Judge Bruce Schroeder's ruling Tuesday denied the defense's request . Schroeder rejected the defense request Tuesday . He said the request was without merit, noting that the experts have already given evidence of Rittenhouse's actions in the police department during his time there and in training . Schroeder ruled on Tuesday that the prosecutors must show how they can prove Rittenhouse's motive in a pre-trial hearing scheduled for Oct. 21. If there is no evidence of Rittenhouse's motive, the case could be dismissed, Schroeder said . The judge also rejected the defense's request to introduce evidence about one of the victims that was later found in Rittenhouse's possession ."}

In the wake of the mass shootings in Michigan earlier this month, blood banks across the U.S. were encouraged to host blood drive events in their communities, but Bass Pro Shop in Fort Smith, Arkansas, has chosen to organize one near a store that sells firearms similar to those used in the school shooting. The blood drive was held Thursday night at Bass Pro Shop in the downtown area. The store is just south of the school shooting at an elementary school in Auburn Hills, Michigan, where 26 people were killed. They were gunned down in March over the weekend, and authorities there are searching for a suspect. \"We felt it was appropriate to step up as a blood bank to help the families in Auburn Hills,\" Arkansas Blood Institute Executive Director Mark Schultz said in a statement. The press release for the event notes, \"Auburn Hills is a town of some 13,000 that is served by the Fort Smith hospital, which is the only hospital in the city.\" Bass Pro Shop, a popular fishing and hunting equipment retailer, is also a gun store. The news comes as a reminder of the controversy surrounding mass shootings and blood donation. Last year in New York City and Chicago, gun owners and advocates criticized mass blood drive events that were held in their respective neighborhoods. The group Gun Violence Archive, which tracks gun violence in the U.S., says there have been more than 200 mass shootings in the U.S. this year, the most in at least eight years. While there are blood drive events across the country hosted by nonprofits and local hospitals, there is concern that, for many people, they are inconvenient and they have to drive to locations far from where they work or where they live. Critics say blood drive events provide a false sense of safety and make it easier for people to purchase guns online.\n\nArkansas blood drive is held near gun store parking lot, where sales of guns similar to those used in school shooting are conducted. Photo provided by Bass Pro Shop\n\nFor example, the gun store at Bass Pro Shop sells a .45-caliber semi-automatic rifle, which is similar to the one used in the Auburn Hills school shooting, according to the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). The .45-caliber semi-automatic rifle, similar to one used in Auburn Hills shooting, can be purchased from Bass Pro Shop. The FBI is investigating the Auburn Hills school shooting, which killed at least 24 students, teachers and staff.

'Free speech' Parler, a social network known for its conservative views, was popular among those who protested against President Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the election . By . John O'Donnell . Amazon has suspended Amazon Web Services (AWS) service from the far-right social network Parler. Parler has been using AWS to host the site since 2016. Amazon announced the suspension on its website today, which does not specifically state why it has suspended AWS service, but in a statement said that Parler had failed to comply with the terms of use of AWS, and would no longer be able to use AWS until the site complies with the terms. The suspended service is crucial for Parler, because Parler is currently unable to move its website to a different hosting service, as Amazon's decision could shut down the site without a new cloud provider, meaning all of Parler's users would lose their accounts. Parler's CEO, John Matze, responded to the news of Amazon's decision to ban Parler from its cloud services. He told CNBC that Amazon, Google, and Apple are colluding to eliminate competition. 'It is clear to all that Parler, which has long been the darling of the alt-right community, was the first and only true alternative to Facebook and Twitter. Amazon and the rest of the tech giants are trying to suppress innovation and free speech. We will fight back. It is a victory for democracy, and a victory for the free-speech movement,' Matze said. He added that the tech giants are only doing this for the profits that Amazon makes from the advertising they can place on Parler's site. Amazon said that users of Parler will no longer be able to use Parler unless they delete the violent incitement posts the site currently carries, and Amazon has stated that it is willing to negotiate with Parler on a deal to remove the posts.

Woods, who suffered severe injuries to his lower leg in the crash, has continued to have progress, and is now playing golf in person for the first time since the crash. The 38-year-old golfer played golf in California over the weekend for the first time in months. Tiger Woods still has a long road ahead of him if he ever returns to touring golf, but he is now optimistic about the prospect of returning to competitive golf. The golfer was recently pictured playing in person in California and Florida."}

As the case of Gabby Petito became a matter of national news, the focus on her race became especially prevalent. Journalists and public figures from across the ideological spectrum criticized media attention to her case, pointing out that it's a symptom of a longstanding problem in media storytelling. Why focus on her race, and how can race be a factor when reporting? Media coverage of missing women has focused on race disproportionately over the years, according to Chris Cuomo, who has been covering the case of missing woman, Gabby Petito, for the past three months. (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nGabby Petito, 23, from Idaho, went missing on August 3, 2017. She has been missing for almost five months. Her disappearance has been covered extensively in the media and has led to widespread public concern about her safety.\n\nThe case of Petito, whose disappearance sparked nationwide debate on the issue of missing white women, has received intense media coverage since her disappearance. The story has been reported by multiple outlets, including CNN, the Washington Post, Fox News, and the BBC. A number of politicians from both sides of the political spectrum have also shared their views on the case and have been critical of media coverage of Petito's disappearance.\n\nIn fact, the hashtag #missingwhitewomensyndrome has been trending on Twitter since Gabby Petito's disappearance, with millions of people sharing their opinions on the issue. The hashtag was started by the author and activist Lauren Berard in June of this year. As the name suggests, the hashtag highlights media's disproportionate focus on white female victims, neglecting victims of color.\n\nThe hashtag trending on Twitter has been criticized by journalists and public figures from across the ideological spectrum. Others have argued that the hashtag is actually a symptom of a larger problem in media coverage of missing women. According to a CNN article written by Lauren Berard and published last month, the term 'missing white woman syndrome' was coined by a woman who worked as a magazine editor when she was a teenager. She felt that media coverage of missing women was skewed by a focus on white women of a similar age to her, and often neglected cases of women of color.\n\nThe article explains that although the hashtag was coined by a teenager, the term was popularized by a news reporter. She used the term to explain how the news media's focus on missing women was a symptom of a larger problem in media coverage of missing women."}

But Joe Biden and the Democrats did not like this deal and pushed to pass the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which included more cash for American families. The $2,000 stimulus checks were a part of the original proposal and were part of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, but Congress did not approve them. How did Democrats initially push for a $2,000 stimulus check? Here's what Democrats said they wanted from the plan, per the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. Here are the key points. The House and Senate passed the American Rescue Plan on Friday, and President Joe Biden signed the bill into law on Saturday. It includes more than $4 trillion in aid to combat the Covid-19 virus and rebuild the economy, as well as $1,400 stimulus checks for individuals and $2,800 for married and joint filers.

I was standing in the rotunda on a rainy day in Washington, D.C., a few years ago when I watched my husband be sworn in as vice president. It was an extraordinary moment. I think about all the good that Joe Biden will do for the nation, but I also think about the future of our country. On the one hand, we knew that there were problems in the country. The country was going through a pandemic and racial unrest was at an all-time high. But on the other hand, I felt that we were on the road to recovery. I knew that Joe Biden's campaign would be tough, but the country was going to get through. I am confident that this will be just the beginning. This moment in time is very special, but I am also very aware of where we are. We are a country that was ravaged by the pandemic, we have racial unrest that is at an all-time high, and we have a deep, deep division. Joe Biden's administration will have to work hard to bring us back together. This is an historic moment for our country. And hopefully, it will create a moment of unification. Biden will have to break down walls. I think he will be able to do that. There will be many challenges ahead, and we need him to make sure that his administration is focused on fixing the problems that we all face. He has a long road ahead of him.

During that period of time, Colin Powell served as U.S. Secretary of Defense and helped craft the U.S. military strategy for Iraq. Since then, several high-profile U.S. military officials, including Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey, have served as Secretary of Defense. In addition, the National Security Advisor John Bolton has served in that position. As a result, a U.S. military presence in Iraq was deemed essential to the nation's security interests. However, as I have argued previously, it is time to withdraw the troops from Iraq, now that the U.S. government has decisively won both the Iraq War and the War on Terror. President Donald Trump is committed to U.S. national interests and to keeping the U.S. out of harm's way. In fact, the people who served in the George W. Bush administration could not have been more different from Trump on a number of issues, including on foreign policy. In addition, President Trump has been more than willing to engage with other nations and willing to put the interests of the U.S. ahead of the interests of other countries. As a result, the Trump administration is in the right place at the wrong time. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is widely expected to play a key role during the George W. Bush administration. Pompeo worked closely with Colin Powell, and he understands Powellian strategy. He will bring a different perspective to the White House than the Bush administration."}

Graham, R-S.C., would like to see companies, such as Twitter, forced to share their user information with the government if they violated privacy laws . (CNN) On Friday, U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a staunch Trump ally, announced he intends to challenge Twitter's recent ban of President Trump from posting on its platform. Graham said the move should not be viewed as a legal victory for Trump, but instead as a chance for the U.S. to take back control of what happens on social media. He told reporters that he would fight to restore Trump to Twitter and that the president's tweets would continue to be available to the public. On Tuesday, Twitter banned Trump from its platform indefinitely, saying he had engaged in violence against the country. Trump called the decision a \"ridiculous attack\" and a \"slam dunk.\" Twitter has said the president violated its terms of service, including its ban on inciting violence. He said in a statement released on Twitter Friday that he had no doubt Twitter could be held accountable by the court if Trump violated its policies again. \"This is what happens when you have absolute immunity from being sued,\" he said. Graham said he believes that Twitter can be held accountable for its actions, but that it shouldn't be \"absolutely immune from being sued.\" He also argued that Twitter must share information with the government if companies violate privacy laws. \"I think it's possible Twitter would do something similar to what Facebook did when Facebook was selling the data of its users to the political advertisers and campaign groups,\" he said. \"If you can't trust a company, you don't use it.\""}

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission released a report Thursday on the causes of what many call the worst blackout in US history. The 28 recommendations are focused on generator winterization, conducting annual winterization training, and monitoring pipeline temperatures. This image shows an outage street in Texas. Officials have been looking for answers to what led to the severe blackout, which many attribute to winter weather.\n\nFor years, regulators have tried to crack the mystery of why this happened. FERC released its findings Thursday, and regulators say they now know the main cause of the Texas blackout was \"freezing or insufficient winterizing of generators,\" according to the FERC report. The findings say that 44% of the issues were due to freezing, while 31% were due to natural gas fuel shortages. But most natural gas production and processing facilities were not protected against load shedding, leading to a decline in supply. This picture shows a block of homes during the blackout.

It was signed by all eight members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. They described it as a direct assault on the U.S. Congress, the Capitol building, and the constitutional process.\n\nPresident Trump called the uprising a hoax and claimed that his supporters were the victim of an \"orchestrated insurrection\" designed to overturn the election result, and then tried to storm the building. Authorities later arrested more than 100 people after the riot. The insurrection left five people dead, including a police officer, and more than 50 people with injuries. Trump has since been impeached by the House of Representatives and convicted on two articles of impeachment by the Senate, which convicted him of inciting a riot and encouraging an insurrection. The officers were on their way to the Capitol as part of a pro-Trump march when they were attacked. At least one of them was shot and injured. The Capitol riot was not the first time violence had broken out in Washington, DC. Four years ago, a Trump supporter threw a Molotov cocktail in the House of Representatives. In all, there were at least 25 previous incidents in Washington over the course of the Trump administration, the Wall Street Journal reports.

You can read the full version of the Guardian's original article by clicking here\n\nOn Monday the U.S. Senate affirmed a conviction in a racial profiling trial against Kyle Rittenhouse, the 17-year-old who shot dead several protesters in Kenosha, Wisconsin. The U.S. Supreme Court has refused to hear the appeal, so the case against Rittenhouse will go to the highest federal court in the country, to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, and there is a good chance that the Supreme Court will decide the case. Rittenhouse has been charged with killing two unarmed black men and wounding a third in August 2020, and was acquitted of the charges. We are disappointed in the verdict, but not surprised, and have been advocating for Kyle since he was 16, and still do. Read More ... Kyle Rittenhouse was tried in Kenosha over the killing of two unarmed protesters in August 2020\n\nThe murder of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man, in March of this year, has also been the subject of a racial trial and conviction in Georgia. There have been calls for a federal trial in that case. The U.S. Supreme Court this week declined to hear a request for a review of an unrelated case in which a Georgia man had been found guilty in his trial. As a U.S. Senate spokesperson, we take a unique perspective on this subject. We don't have direct influence over the law or the courts, but we do play an important role in sharing information and educating the American public on these cases and the implications of race. That's why we have written a statement on the Kyle Rittenhouse verdict, which we want to share with you. Kyle Rittenhouse was tried in Kenosha over the killing of two unarmed protesters in August 2020. He was acquitted of all charges, but the case will go to the highest federal court in the country. The statement mentions that Ahmaud Arbery, who was unarmed, was shot and killed in Georgia in March of this year, and that case has been the subject of a racial trial and conviction in Georgia. Both cases raise troubling questions around race and bias. The Supreme Court this week declined to hear a request for a review of an unrelated case in which a Georgia man had been found guilty in his trial. Rittenhouse's trial focused on the shooting of two unarmed black men. The case against Rittenhouse was dismissed by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2019, and the case is currently on appeal. Rittenhouse was charged with killing two unarmed black men and wounding a third in August 2020. We are disappointed in the verdict, but not surprised, and have been advocating for Kyle since he was 16, and still do."}

Dr Tulio de Oliveira is a journalist for Nature.com who is writing this article as part of his work reporting on the global health crisis. What is the message? People with HIV and other comorbidities should be prioritised for vaccination against COVID-19. What does this mean? This means that people with HIV should be entitled to priority for vaccination, and access to free treatment should be increased and expanded to ensure that people with HIV and other comorbidities are treated as they should be. Please consider signing the letter to urge health ministers to do so. People with HIV should be entitled to priority for vaccination, and access to free treatment should be increased and expanded to ensure that people with HIV and other comorbidities are treated as they should be. This is a Call to Action for health ministers to give priority consideration to these unique health problems caused by HIV. HIV is a chronic, progressive and life-threatening infection that takes a serious toll on those who are infected, but there is no known cure. Therefore, effective treatment is necessary to reduce viral load, which in turn helps to keep the virus from replicating within people with HIV. This in turn reduces the risk of transmitting the infection to others, especially those who are most vulnerable, like children and pregnant women, and it is the most effective way of preventing HIV transmission to others. This can be done through treatment and access to antiretroviral therapy (ART), which, according to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates has saved more than 3 million lives since its introduction in 1996. HIV can be treated and controlled with ART and HIV drugs are easily available and are free in many countries. Unfortunately, in 2020, the number of people with access to HIV drugs was at a critically low level, causing the WHO to urge all governments to urgently increase treatment coverage in those with HIV. In fact, the latest figures from UNAIDS revealed that treatment coverage for people living with HIV (PLHIV) in low-and middle-income countries has fallen by more than 10% since 2017. Some of the most worrying factors that threaten the health of people with HIV, including those living in the United States, are the lack of access to ART and lack of prevention, which is due to a lack of access to HIV drugs. In Africa, where an estimated 29 million people are living with HIV, the...

It's been a month since one of the largest container ships to ever enter the Suez Canal went awol. The ship, operated by Evergreen, was in the water for more than two weeks and is currently the biggest container ship ever to get stuck in a canal, with a diameter that is smaller than a football field. Scroll down for video\n\nThe size of the container ship is mind-blowing, and the fact that the ship has been stuck in a canal for so long makes it even more spectacular. Ever Given's predicament has highlighted the normally invisible infrastructure of global capital and supply chains. It is both an indictment of our capitalist economy and a call to greater transparency and collaboration, as the Guardian's Mark Avery explains.
