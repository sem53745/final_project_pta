But there's one matchup in particular that I'm really looking forward to.\"\n\nManning's excitement was palpable as he spoke about the upcoming clash between his former rival, Tom Brady, and New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees.\n\n\"Drew and Tom are two of the greatest quarterbacks to ever play the game,\" Manning said. \"To see them go head-to-head at this stage in their careers is really something special.\"\n\nSince retiring from the NFL, Manning has kept a low profile compared to his brother Peyton, engaging in charity work and brand endorsements. However, he still makes time for old teammates and friends, like Victor Cruz.\n\n\"Vic and I have been working on a Super Bowl food ideas initiative called Stella Stadium Bites,\" Manning explained. \"It's been a great collaboration, and we're really excited about the potential impact we can make.\"\n\nReflecting on his storied rivalry with Brady, Manning emphasized the importance of team effort in their Super Bowl victories.\n\n\"We had some great battles against the Patriots, but it was never just about me and Tom,\" Manning said. \"It was about our team and our ability to come together and execute when it mattered most.\"\n\nPlaying smart football against teams like the Patriots was a key factor in the Giants' success, Manning noted.\n\n\"You have to be disciplined and focused against them,\" he said. \"They're a well-oiled machine, and you can't afford to make mistakes.\"\n\nManning's relationship with his brother Peyton has always been a source of inspiration and camaraderie.\n\n\"We've always had a great bond, both on and off the field,\" Manning said. \"We love talking football and analyzing games together. It's just part of who we are.\"\n\nDespite being considered the quieter Manning brother, Eli shared memories of watching Super Bowls with his family and the significance of such moments.\n\n\"Those are some of my favorite memories,\" he said. \"Being able to share those experiences with my loved ones is something I'll always cherish.\"\n\nCollaborating with Cruz on Super Bowl-related activities beyond his playing days has been a rewarding experience for Manning.\n\n\"Vic and I have a great chemistry, both on and off the field,\" he said. \"It's been a pleasure to work with him on this project, and I know we're going to make a difference.\"\n\nManning expressed admiration for the longevity and skill of both Brees and Brady as they continue playing at a high level into their 40s.\n\n\"They're both still at the top of their game,\" Manning said. \"It's a testament to their dedication and work ethic.

Amid the condemnation of the unprecedented violence, some lawmakers referred to the rioters as \"patriots,\" fueling further division and controversy.\n\nThe riot was reportedly emboldened by President Trump and Republican rally attendees, including state lawmakers, who gathered in Washington D.C. to support Trump's efforts to overturn the election results. One GOP state lawmaker, Rep. Russell Fry of South Carolina, has already resigned following public backlash for attending the rally before the riot.\n\nThe rally, which drew thousands of supporters, was held to protest the certification of President-elect Joe Biden's electoral votes. Several Republican lawmakers, including Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Josh Hawley of Missouri, were present at the rally and addressed the crowd before the violent events unfolded.\n\nThe rioters, some of whom were armed, organized an attempted coup, storming the Capitol building as Congress was in the process of certifying the election results. At least five people, including one police officer, died during the event, and investigations into the riot's planning and execution are ongoing.\n\nMembers of the Proud Boys, a far-right extremist group classified as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, were reportedly present at the riot. The group's leader, Enrique Tarrio, was arrested earlier in the day for burning a Black Lives Matter banner taken from a historic Black church.\n\nAmid the chaos, a Senate aide managed to secure the electoral vote boxes, ensuring they were not damaged during the riot. The Senate and House of Representatives eventually reconvened hours later and certified President-elect Biden's victory, with Vice President Mike Pence presiding over the joint session.\n\nTrump, in a video message posted on Twitter shortly before the session resumed, called for an orderly transition and urged his supporters to go home peacefully. However, some Republicans have continued to question the election results, and calls for Trump's impeachment on charges of \"incitement of an insurrection\" have emerged.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced that she will begin the process of impeaching Trump for a second time, while some Democrats have also called for the expulsion of GOP lawmakers who supported the president's efforts to overturn the election results.\n\nThe riot at the Capitol has sparked widespread backlash against Republicans, with many Americans expressing outrage over the violence and the role that some GOP lawmakers played in fanning the flames of election conspiracy theories.\n\nSocial media platforms, including Twitter and Facebook, have taken steps to limit the spread of misinformation about the election and the events at the Capitol. Google and Apple have also removed the Parler app from their app stores, citing concerns over the platform's role in the spread of violent content.\n\nThe riot at the Capitol has raised serious concerns about the security of the US democratic process and the role of social media in shaping public discourse. Experts warn that the events of January 6th could have long-lasting implications for American democracy.\n\nAs the nation grapples with the aftermath of the Capitol riot, many are calling for unity and healing. However, the deep divisions that fueled the riot remain, and it remains to be seen how the country will move forward.\n\nIn the days and weeks ahead, the focus will shift to the incoming Biden administration and its plans to address the many challenges facing the nation. However, the events of January 6th serve as a reminder of the fragility of American democracy and the importance of respecting the rule of law."}

James' damning allegation, made in a report released on January 28, 2022, raised serious questions about the state's handling of the pandemic and its impact on vulnerable elderly residents.\n\nWilliam A. Jacobson, a media critic and Cornell Law School professor, did not mince words when reacting to the controversy. \"Governor Cuomo directed nursing homes to accept COVID-positive patients, and now we learn that thousands more died than were reported,\" said Jacobson. \"This is a massive scandal, and the fact that it involved the Cuomo brothers' relationship only adds to the intrigue.\"\n\nAs the scandal unfolded, it came to light that Governor Cuomo had directed nursing homes to accept COVID-19 patients, potentially contributing to the high death rates among elderly residents. CNN, where the governor's brother Chris Cuomo is a prominent anchor, faced intense criticism for its handling of the issue.\n\nSteve Krakauer, a former CNN digital producer and media watchdog, weighed in on the controversy. \"CNN's handling of the Cuomo brothers' interviews was a textbook example of a conflict of interest,\" Krakauer said. \"The network should have been more transparent about the relationship and provided more nuanced coverage of the nursing home scandal.\"\n\nWhen the nursing home controversy was finally addressed on CNN, Governor Cuomo deflected criticism jokingly. During a March 3, 2022, interview with his brother, Chris Cuomo asked, \"What do you make of the allegation that New York underreported nursing home deaths?\" To which the governor quipped, \"I'd make a joke, but it's a little early in the morning.\"\n\nJournalist Glenn Greenwald did not hold back in his criticism of CNN's handling of the scandal. \"CNN's refusal to acknowledge the clear conflict of interest in their coverage of the Cuomo brothers only underscores the media's complicity in protecting powerful figures,\" Greenwald said.\n\nGovernor Cuomo, who had previously been lauded by the liberal media, authored a book on leadership, and received an Emmy Award, defended his nursing home policy. In a March 2, 2022, press conference, he blamed the Trump administration for COVID-related issues and argued that his policy was based on the best available science at the time.\n\nMedia watchdogs and commentators on both sides of the political spectrum criticized the coverage and handling of the Cuomo nursing home scandal. The controversy raised important questions about the role of the media in holding powerful figures accountable, and the potential consequences of conflicts of interest.\n\nLetitia James, in her report, suggested that the mandated admission of COVID-19 patients into nursing homes may have increased residents' risk. The attorney general called for greater transparency and accountability in reporting nursing home deaths, stating, \"We cannot allow this to happen again.\"\n\nAs the fallout from the nursing home scandal continues, the public remains divided on the issue. Some believe that the media should have been more transparent about the Cuomo brothers' relationship, while others argue that the focus should be on holding Governor Cuomo accountable for the state's handling of the pandemic. Regardless of where one stands on the issue, it is clear that the nursing home scandal has significantly impacted the reputations of both the Cuomo brothers and CNN.\n\nWilliam A. Jacobson weighed in on the broader implications of the scandal. \"This is a wake-up call for the media and the public to demand greater transparency and accountability,\" Jacobson said. \"The Cuomo nursing home scandal is a reminder that power and influence can't shield individuals from being held accountable for their actions.\"\n\nAs the investigation into the nursing home scandal continues, it remains to be seen what consequences Governor Cuomo and CNN will face. One thing is certain: the public will be watching closely to see how the media covers this developing story and whether they hold those in power accountable for their actions.\n\nGlenn Greenwald, in a scathing critique, summed up the situation. \"The media's handling of the Cuomo nursing home scandal is a clear example of why the public's trust in the media is at an all-time low,\" Greenwald said. \"We need a media that is transparent, unbiased, and dedicated to the truth, not one that protects powerful figures at the expense of the public's wellbeing.\"\n\nSteve Krakauer echoed Greenwald's sentiments. \"The Cuomo nursing home scandal is a reminder that the media has a responsibility to the public to report the facts, not to protect the powerful,\" Krakauer said. \"We need a media that is committed to holding those in power accountable, not one that turns a blind eye to conflicts of interest and scandals.\"\n\nLetitia James, in her report, emphasized the importance of transparency and accountability in reporting nursing home deaths. \"We cannot allow this to happen again,\" James said. \"The public deserves to know the truth about the number of lives lost in New York's nursing homes during the pandemic.\""}

This achievement comes as we continue to see promising declines in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.\n\nWhen President Biden took office on January 20, 2021, only 5% of adult Americans had been vaccinated, and the initial pace of vaccinations was slow. In response, the Biden Administration launched an ambitious COVID-19 strategy to ramp up vaccine production, distribution, and administration.\n\nAs of now, more than 175 million Americans have received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose, representing over 54% of the total U.S. population. Among adult Americans, 65% have received at least one shot, and 55% are fully vaccinated.\n\nThe Biden Administration's efforts have been multi-faceted, focusing on securing a stable vaccine supply, increasing the number of vaccination sites, and mobilizing federal personnel to support vaccinations.\n\nTo date, over 81,000 vaccination sites have been established across the country, ensuring that Americans can easily get vaccinated within 5 miles of where they live. These sites include community health centers, hospitals, pharmacies, and mass vaccination sites.\n\nThe federal pharmacy vaccination program has expanded to 42,000 local pharmacies, which have administered over 82 million shots. This program has been crucial in expanding access to vaccines in underserved communities.\n\nAdditionally, the Biden Administration has set up 39 federally-run, high-volume vaccination sites, primarily in areas with high vulnerability to COVID-19. These sites have administered millions of doses and have played a critical role in increasing vaccination rates.\n\nCommunity health centers have played a significant role in the vaccination effort, particularly for the poverty-line population and racial/ethnic minorities. These centers have hosted almost 11,000 pop-up clinics, ensuring that these communities have equitable access to vaccines.\n\nThe Biden Administration has prioritized equity in its COVID-19 response, with a majority of federally-provided shots going to people of color. The Administration has also provided support for over 20,000 community-based pop-up vaccination clinics.\n\nPresident Biden's COVID-19 strategy has been successful in increasing vaccine distribution and administration, but it is essential that Americans continue to get vaccinated. The Administration encourages everyone who is eligible to get vaccinated as soon as possible to help protect themselves, their loved ones, and their communities.\n\nCOVID-19 vaccines are safe, effective, and free. They have undergone rigorous clinical trials and have been authorized for emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for all eligible individuals.\n\nThe Biden Administration remains committed to ensuring that every American has access to COVID-19 vaccines and the resources needed to get vaccinated. We will continue to work tirelessly to ensure that our country emerges from this pandemic stronger and more united than ever before."}

The situation has reached a boiling point, prompting creative protests and sharp criticism of the local government.\n\nDuring a City Council committee meeting on Sept. 21, residents testified about the uncollected trash that had accumulated before and after the hurricane hit on Aug. 29. \"I've never seen anything like this in my life,\" said lifelong resident Carolyn Williams. \"It's been over a month, and we still have trash on our streets.\"\n\nAaron 'Louisiana' Grant, a local artist and activist, proposed a solution with a satirical twist: a Trash Parade.

Grant's intention was to draw attention to the issue in a lighthearted yet impactful way.\n\nApproximately 150 protesters participated in the Trash Parade on Sept. 25, showcasing their creativity with costumes made from discarded materials. \"We wanted to make a statement, but also find joy in the chaos,\" Grant explained. \"Humor is a powerful coping mechanism in the aftermath of a disaster.\"\n\nMayor LaToya Cantrell acknowledged the garbage collection problems during a press conference, attributing them to a workforce shortage exacerbated by Hurricane Ida. \"We understand the frustration of our residents, and we're working to address this issue as quickly as possible,\" Cantrell said.\n\nDespite the Trash Parade and the mayor's acknowledgment of the issue, trash remains visible throughout the city. Residents like Grant are growing increasingly frustrated with the lack of progress. \"It's been over a month, and there's still no sign of improvement,\" Grant stated.\n\nGrant's criticism of the local government's response extends beyond the trash crisis. \"Where is the planning and preparation for situations like this?\" he asked. \"Why isn't sanitation a priority like electrical and healthcare services?\"\n\nThe city is seeking help from outside contractors to address the sanitation crisis. However, residents like Grant remain skeptical. \"We've seen promises before, and we'll believe it when we see it,\" he said.\n\nMayor Cantrell emphasized the importance of patience and understanding during this difficult time. \"We're doing everything we can to get our city back on its feet,\" she said. \"But it's going to take time, and we need everyone's cooperation and understanding.\"\n\nGrant and other residents aren't willing to wait indefinitely. \"We can't let this become the new normal,\" he said. \"We deserve better, and we're going to keep pushing for it.\"\n\nAs the Trash Parade came to a close, participants took to social media to express their frustration and solidarity. \"#TrashParadeNOLA: When the city can't handle the trash, we will,\" one participant wrote. \"Together, we'll clean up New Orleans, one parade at a time.\"\n\nThe Trash Parade may have been a satirical protest, but it highlighted a serious issue that affects the lives and well-being of New Orleans residents. With the help of outside contractors and the resilience of the community, the city is working to overcome this challenge and restore normalcy. But for many, the memory of the Trash Parade serves as a reminder of the importance of holding their elected officials accountable for the services they provide."}

The messages revealed that Griffin offered large sums of money to women and their daughters for sexual acts, including in the presence of minors.\n\nUS Attorney Nikolas P. Kerest emphasized the need to keep Griffin detained for community safety. \"The defendant in this case, John Griffin, is a wealthy man who attempted to use his wealth to influence the legal process,\" Kerest said in a statement. \"Despite his previous privilege, he now faces substantial legal and reputational risks.\"\n\nThe indictment alleges that Griffin offered money for \"sexual subservience\" training sessions at his Vermont ski house for girls as young as 9. Griffin reportedly communicated with a victim's mother, offering to pay her $25,000 to bring her daughter to one of these sessions.\n\nHeather Carriker, 33, was arrested for her role in the abuse of her own daughters at Griffin's house. Carriker is charged with one count of conspiracy to engage in illicit sexual conduct with a minor.\n\nAccording to court documents, Griffin engaged in disturbing communications, including reassuring someone who sexually assaulted a baby that he could \"get away with it.\" Griffin also allegedly attempted to use his wealth to influence the legal process, offering a family member of a victim $4,000 as a payoff.\n\nThe Southern District of New York has jurisdiction over the case due to the interstate and foreign commerce aspects of the alleged offenses. Griffin's alleged victims are located in various states across the country.\n\n\"The defendant in this case is charged with attempting to prey on the most vulnerable members of our society, children,\" Kerest said. \"We will do everything in our power to ensure that he faces the consequences of his alleged actions.\"\n\nGriffin's arraignment is scheduled for March 16, 2023, in Manhattan federal court. If convicted, he could face up to 30 years in prison.\n\n\"The safety of our communities is our top priority,\" Kerest added. \"We will continue to work tirelessly to bring those who seek to harm children to justice.\"\n\nGriffin's attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAs the investigation into Griffin's alleged crimes continues, more details are expected to emerge.

There's no signs of impairment at the scene.\" (Villanueva, LA County Sheriff's Department)\n\nHowever, Charles Schack, President of Crash Experts, a forensic engineering firm, believes that a more comprehensive investigation was needed. \"The lack of skid marks and Woods' inability to remember driving are both signs of potential inattentiveness or impairment,\" Schack explained. (Schack, Crash Experts)\n\nAccident reconstruction experts suggest that a drug recognition expert (DRE) should have been called to the scene to evaluate Woods for signs of impairment. DREs are specially trained officers who can determine the need for a blood test based on a driver's medications, eyes, and vital signs.\n\nJonathan Cherney, a former detective, noted that the crash appeared to be a case of falling asleep at the wheel. \"The absence of attempts to brake or steer away from the crash site suggests a lack of attention or impairment,\" Cherney stated. (Cherney, Former Detective)\n\nChris Taylor, Managing Attorney at Taylor & Taylor, added, \"A blood test could have identified any medications or drugs in Woods' system, potentially leading to charges of misdemeanor driving under the influence.\" (Taylor, Taylor & Taylor)\n\nHowever, it is now too late to access Woods' blood and medical reports without his cooperation or a search warrant. The sheriff's department obtained the SUV's \"black box\" data but has not released its findings.\n\nVillanueva defended the department's actions, stating, \"We followed the proper procedures in investigating this incident. Mr. Woods was cooperative, and there was no evidence or signs of impairment.\" (Villanueva, LA County Sheriff's Department)\n\nSchack, however, disagreed, stating, \"It's important to remember that an 'accident' doesn't necessarily mean there was no negligence or impairment involved. A thorough investigation is always necessary to determine the cause of a crash.\" (Schack, Crash Experts)\n\nCherney added, \"It's unfortunate that the focus has been on Woods' injuries and not on the investigation of the crash itself. A proper investigation could have provided valuable insights into the cause of the crash and potentially prevented similar incidents in the future.\" (Cherney, Former Detective)\n\nTaylor emphasized the importance of a proper investigation, stating, \"The public has a right to know that law enforcement is conducting thorough investigations into crashes, especially those involving high-profile individuals. Ruling a crash an 'accident' without a proper investigation sends the wrong message.\" (Taylor, Taylor & Taylor)\n\nThe California Highway Patrol is currently conducting its own investigation into the crash, which could potentially lead to new information being uncovered.\n\nThe Woods crash serves as a reminder of the importance of a thorough investigation in determining the cause of a crash. While the focus has been on Woods' injuries, it is crucial not to overlook the importance of a proper investigation in ensuring public safety and holding negligent parties accountable.\n\nIn the words of Schack, \"A thorough investigation is always necessary to determine the cause of a crash and prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.\" (Schack, Crash Experts)\n\nAs the investigation into the Woods crash continues, it remains to be seen what new information will be uncovered and how it will impact the public's perception of the incident. One thing is clear, however: a proper investigation is essential in ensuring public safety and holding negligent parties accountable.\n\nIn the meantime, the focus should be on the importance of thorough investigations in determining the cause of crashes and preventing similar incidents from happening in the future. As Schack aptly put it, \"An 'accident' doesn't necessarily mean there was no negligence or impairment involved. A thorough investigation is always necessary to determine the cause of a crash.\" (Schack, Crash Experts)"}

Later in the day, he was scheduled to visit New York City to assess the aftermath of Hurricane Ida's remnants.\n\n\"I've seen firsthand the devastating impact of Hurricane Ida,\" Biden said during a briefing at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) headquarters in New Jersey. \"This is not just a New Jersey problem or a New York problem. It's an American problem.\"\n\nBiden's visit to the Northeast came a week after he traveled to Louisiana to survey the damage from Hurricane Ida's initial landfall as a powerful Category 4 storm. The hurricane caused catastrophic flooding as it moved northward, resulting in over 50 fatalities across six eastern states.\n\n\"Climate change poses an existential threat to our nation and the world,\" Biden emphasized. \"We're seeing more frequent and intense storms, more devastating wildfires, more prolonged droughts. We need to act with urgency and scale.\"\n\nNew Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, who accompanied Biden during the tour, shared his concerns about the future. \"The science is clear: Our climate is changing, and we need to adapt,\" Murphy said.\n\nBiden has approved major disaster declarations for several counties in New Jersey and New York, paving the way for federal aid to help with recovery efforts. \"We're going to stand with you all the way,\" Biden assured the affected communities.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Jen Psaki echoed the president's sentiments during a press briefing. \"The devastation wrought by Hurricane Ida is a stark reminder of the urgent need for action on climate change,\" Psaki said.\n\nHurricane Ida made landfall in Louisiana on August 29, 2021, as a Category 4 storm with winds of up to 150 miles per hour (241 kilometers per hour). The storm left a trail of destruction, causing billions of dollars in damages and displacing thousands of residents.\n\nBiden's visit to New Jersey and New York was aimed at pushing for federal spending on infrastructure to better defend against future storms. \"We need to invest in our infrastructure, not just to rebuild after a disaster, but to prevent future disasters,\" Biden said.\n\nDuring his tour of flood-damaged areas in New Jersey, Biden met with emergency responders and victims of the storm. He expressed his sympathies and offered words of encouragement. \"We'll be with you every step of the way,\" Biden assured the residents.\n\nGovernor Murphy indicated that the clean-up and rebuilding process would take months. \"This is going to be a long-term recovery effort,\" Murphy said. \"But we will get through this together.\"\n\nBiden's visit to New York City was expected to include a tour of storm-damaged areas, as well as meetings with local officials and emergency responders. \"We're going to make sure New Yorkers have the resources they need to recover and rebuild,\" Biden pledged.\n\nThe remnants of Hurricane Ida brought record rainfall to the Northeast, causing widespread flooding and power outages. In New York City alone, over 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain fell in just a few hours.\n\nBiden's focus on climate change and the need for urgent action comes as the United States faces an increasing number of extreme weather events. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the first half of 2021 saw 20 separate billion-dollar weather and climate disasters.\n\nThe president's call for action on climate change also includes investments in renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power. \"We need to transition away from fossil fuels and towards clean, renewable energy,\" Biden said.\n\nIn Louisiana, Biden pledged $1.6 billion in federal funding to help the state recover from Hurricane Ida. He also promised to work with Congress to pass a bipartisan infrastructure bill, which includes provisions for climate resilience and disaster recovery.\n\nDuring his visit to New Jersey, Biden emphasized the importance of community resilience in the face of extreme weather events. \"We need to build communities that can withstand the impacts of climate change,\" Biden said.\n\nPsaki highlighted the widespread impact of severe weather across the United States. \"We've seen devastating wildfires in the West, historic flooding in the Midwest, and now record-breaking rainfall in the Northeast,\" Psaki noted.\n\nBiden's focus on climate change and infrastructure investments reflects a growing recognition of the need to address the root causes of extreme weather events. \"We can't just keep reacting to disasters,\" Biden said. \"We need to be proactive and invest in the future.\""}

Previously, the timing had been reported as 8:46 due to a math error by the Minneapolis Police Department.\n\n\"There was a one-minute error in the original calculation. The new calculation is based on the actual video,\" said Jerry Blackwell, one of the prosecutors in the case, during a hearing on Monday.\n\nThe discrepancies in the timing are not expected to impact Chauvin's trial, according to Toshira Garraway, founder of Families Supporting Families Against Police Violence, and other experts.\n\n\"What's important is the fact that Mr. Floyd was killed in broad daylight, and the officer had his knee on his neck for an excessive amount of time,\" Garraway said. \"The exact duration is significant, but it's just one piece of the puzzle.\"\n\nChauvin is charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter for Floyd's death. Three other officers, Thomas Lane, J.

Medical experts are expected to testify about the amount of time Floyd spent without oxygen and how it contributed to his death.\n\nProsecutors acknowledged the one-minute error but stated it would not affect the case. The revised timing from prosecutors indicates Chauvin's restraint lasted at least nine minutes but possibly up to 9 minutes, 31 seconds.\n\nDefense attorney Eric Nelson disputed the longer duration, stating that Chauvin's knee was on Floyd's neck for only 7 minutes and 40 seconds, based on his analysis of the body-camera footage. Nelson also argued that Floyd's cause of death was an overdose of fentanyl and methamphetamine, not Chauvin's actions.\n\n\"The video speaks for itself. Mr. Floyd died because his heart stopped, and that was due to his use of drugs, not because of Mr. Chauvin's actions,\" Nelson said during the hearing.\n\nThe trial began on March 29 and is expected to last several weeks. Witnesses have testified about the events leading up to Floyd's death and the actions of Chauvin and the other officers involved.\n\nGarraway and other advocates for police reform have called for transparency and accountability in the criminal justice system. They also emphasized the need for systemic change to address police brutality and racial disparities in law enforcement.\n\n\"We cannot rely solely on the justice system to bring about change. We need to work together as a community to demand accountability and create a world where everyone is treated with dignity and respect,\" Garraway said.\n\nAs the trial continues, the focus remains on the facts of the case and the pursuit of justice for George Floyd and his family.

The situation on the ground has evolved swiftly, and I want to speak directly to the American people about what this means for our nation and our values.\n\nFirst and foremost, let me be clear: the original goals of our mission in Afghanistan were to combat al Qaeda and prevent terrorist attacks on the American homeland. We have achieved significant progress in that regard. Our military and intelligence professionals have worked tirelessly to keep our country safe. But the time has come for us to refocus our efforts on the contemporary threats that face us.\n\nThe current focus of our counterterrorism strategy will be on an over-the-horizon capability. We will continue to work with our allies to prevent Afghanistan from becoming a safe haven for terrorist organizations once again. Our commitment to the security of the American people remains our top priority.\n\nI also want to address the withdrawal agreement negotiated by my predecessor. This agreement left the Biden administration with limited options. We inherited a deal, and we are executing it in the best way possible under the circumstances.\n\nLet me be clear: the decision to withdraw was not an easy one. There was never a 'good time' to withdraw U.S. forces from Afghanistan. But we cannot continue to bear the burden of fighting a conflict that Afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves. We have provided significant support to the Afghan military over the years, but we could not instill the will to fight for their future.\n\nI want to acknowledge the pain and personal impact of this war, especially for our veterans and their families. Your sacrifices will never be forgotten. We will continue to support you and provide the resources you need to heal and reintegrate into society.\n\nNow, let me speak directly to the people of Afghanistan. I want you to know that the United States does not seek perpetual conflict in your country. We want you to live in peace and security. But we cannot support a government that cannot unite politically and negotiate a political settlement with the Taliban.\n\nThe rapid collapse of Afghan political leadership and military is a reinforcement of the decision to withdraw. The Taliban's takeover was not inevitable. The Afghan people had the power to determine their own future, but they chose not to seize the opportunity.\n\nWe will continue to engage with the international community to provide humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people. We will also work to ensure that the gains made in areas like education and women's rights are not lost.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen, as we move forward, we must remember that the United States is more than just a military power. We are a beacon of hope and freedom. We will continue to work towards a world where all people can live in peace and dignity.\n\nIn closing, I want to reiterate that our commitment to the security of the American people remains our top priority. We will continue to work with our allies to prevent Afghanistan from becoming a safe haven for terrorist organizations once again. And we will continue to support our veterans and their families as they heal and reintegrate into society.\n\nThank you. God bless you all, and God bless the United States of America."}

Tassal shared stories of other journalists and Afghan colleagues who had been beaten or detained by the Taliban while attempting to flee. \"We were determined not to let that happen to us,\" he said.\n\nThe Biden administration was escalating evacuation plans, but could not guarantee safe passage to the airport. With the help of British troops, the group managed to bypass a Taliban checkpoint and reach the military base.\n\nUpon arrival, there were initial fears that no charter planes would land that day. An American military officer stepped in, arranging for the group to leave on a U.S. military flight to Qatar.\n\nThe flight was packed with mostly Afghans, with seats removed to accommodate more people. Tassal described the scene as chaotic, with desperate families and damaged vehicles clogging the runway. \"It was a relief to finally be on our way,\" he said.\n\nAs they soared into the sky, Tassal couldn't help but reflect on the harrowing experience. \"We were fortunate to make it out alive,\" he said. \"But there are so many who are still trapped in Kabul, facing an uncertain future.\"\n\nAziz Tassal's voice crackled over the phone as he recounted the events that had unfolded over the past few days. \"It's a difficult time for Afghanistan,\" he said, his voice heavy with emotion. \"But we will continue to report on the situation and bring the world's attention to the stories of those affected.\"\n\nDespite the danger and uncertainty, Tassal remained committed to his role as a journalist. \"We have a responsibility to tell the truth and bear witness to history,\" he said. \"And that's what we will continue to do, no matter what.\"\n\nAs the plane touched down in Doha, Qatar, the group was met with a sense of relief and gratitude. They had made it out of Kabul alive, but the fate of their colleagues and the Afghan people remained uncertain. For Tassal and his daughter, the journey was far from over. They would continue to report on the situation in Afghanistan, bearing witness to history and bringing the world's attention to the stories of those affected."}

The ban, which followed Trump's encouragement of the Capitol riot, led to a significant drop in the spread of false and misleading claims about the election on the platform and others.\n\nDisinformation researcher Kate Starbird of the University of Washington observed a \"steep drop-off\" in election-related disinformation following the ban. Her team at the Center for an Informed Public used data from the media intelligence firm Zignal to track the decline.\n\nZignal's data showed a 73% decrease in election-related disinformation mentions on Twitter the day after the ban. Graham Brookie, director of the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, called the Twitter ban \"a pivotal moment\" in the fight against disinformation.\n\nTrump and his allies lost accounts on multiple platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitch, Spotify, and Shopify, following the Capitol riot. The bans deprived them of the ability to reach new audiences and curbed their momentum to spread false claims.\n\nLeysia Palen, an information science professor at the University of Colorado, noted that while de-platforming can be effective in limiting the reach of disinformation, it may also harden the views of those already engaged in online communities.\n\nThe Twitter ban was part of a broader social media crackdown, with Twitter banning over 70,000 QAnon-affiliated accounts in the days following the riot. The use of hashtags affiliated with the Capitol riot dropped considerably after the ban.\n\nMedia Matters for America, a liberal media watchdog group, reported a significant fall in interactions on right-leaning political Facebook pages following the Capitol riot. The group found that interactions on pages like Breitbart, Gateway Pundit, and The Epoch Times dropped by an average of 30% after the riot.\n\nFew accounts acted as \"superspreaders\" of election misinformation, with Trump's account being a major source. Starbird noted that a small number of accounts were responsible for the majority of the disinformation. These accounts, she said, \"were able to amplify a large amount of content very quickly.\"\n\nAdvance Democracy, a nonprofit organization that monitors disinformation, found a decrease in election fraud claims following the Capitol riot. However, violent narratives continued to spread at the peripheries of online communities.\n\nStarbird cautioned against complacency, noting that \"new actors and new narratives are constantly emerging.\" She urged social media companies to continue their efforts to combat disinformation and maintain transparency in their content moderation policies.\n\nBrookie emphasized the importance of continued research and collaboration between social media companies, researchers, and policymakers in the fight against disinformation. He called for a \"multi-stakeholder approach\" to addressing the issue.\n\nPalen emphasized the need for individuals to fact-check information before sharing it online and to engage in constructive dialogue with those holding opposing views. \"We all have a role to play in creating a more informed public,\" she said.\n\nIn conclusion, the Twitter ban on Donald Trump marked a significant turning point in the fight against election disinformation. While the decline in disinformation is a positive development, it is crucial that social media companies, researchers, policymakers, and individuals remain vigilant in the face of new actors and narratives."}

Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane, and Tou Thao, were federally indicted on Friday, February 11, for violating Floyd's civil rights under color of law.\n\nAccording to the indictment unsealed in the U.S. District Court in Minnesota, the officers are charged with depriving Floyd of his rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, including the use of unreasonable force and deliberate indifference to his medical needs.\n\n\"This indictment reflects the Justice Department's commitment to ensuring that all Americans receive equal protection under the law, regardless of their race or their status as a law enforcement officer,\" said U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland in a statement.\n\nMark Osler, a former federal prosecutor and professor at the University of St. Thomas School of Law, commented on the significance of the federal charges, stating, \"Federal civil rights cases are a big deal because they carry a potential for much longer prison sentences than the state charges.\"\n\nChauvin, who was convicted on state charges of murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death last year, also faces separate federal charges related to a 2017 incident involving the use of excessive force against a 14-year-old.\n\nKenneth Udoibok, a civil rights lawyer and managing partner at Udoibok Law Firm in Minneapolis, shared his thoughts on the importance of the federal charges, \"This is a significant development in the pursuit of justice for George Floyd and his family. The federal indictment reaffirms that no one is above the law and that law enforcement personnel must be held accountable for their actions.\"\n\nRachel Moran, an associate professor of law at the University of St. Thomas, explained the standard the prosecution must meet to convict the officers, \"The government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers' actions were willful violations of Floyd's civil rights under color of law.\"\n\nRebeccah Parks, spokesperson for the U.S. District Court in Minnesota, confirmed that the proceedings' dates have not been set and that they are unlikely to be broadcast, unlike the high-profile state trials.\n\nFederal civil rights charges against law enforcement officers are relatively rare, with an average of 41 cases brought annually between 1990 and 2019, according to a study by the National Police Foundation.\n\nExperts and legal professionals agree that a federal conviction could result in severe penalties, potentially carrying sentences of 20 years to life in prison for each offense.\n\nIn light of the new federal charges, plea negotiations could potentially affect the outcomes for the officers in both the state and federal cases, according to Osler. However, he emphasized that such discussions are still speculative at this stage of the proceedings.\n\nThe federal charges against Chauvin and the other officers add another layer of complexity to the already intricate legal landscape surrounding George Floyd's death. The events that transpired on May 25, 2020, continue to spark national conversations about police accountability, racial justice, and the role of the criminal justice system.\n\nAs the legal proceedings unfold, the public awaits the outcome of these cases with a renewed sense of anticipation and hope for a measure of justice for George Floyd and his family."}

However, the court declared Facebook's terms of service regarding post deletion and account blocking for community standards violations as \"null and void.\"\n\n\"We are reviewing the judgment to continue effectively removing hate speech in Germany while ensuring the rights of our users,\" a Facebook company spokesperson told Reuters in a statement. The spokesperson emphasized Facebook's zero-tolerance policy for hate speech.\n\nThe specific post cited in the court ruling criticized German handling of \"Islamist immigrants,\" alleging impunity for murder and rape. The post called for action from the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, Germany's main domestic security agency.\n\nGoogle also sought judicial review of a new German law (NetzDG) this week, citing privacy concerns due to the law's provisions for data sharing with law enforcement.\n\nThe court's criticism of Facebook for not committing to inform users about post removal, account blocking reasons, or offering a right of appeal, raises questions about how social media platforms can balance free speech with the need to prevent hate speech and incitement to violence.\n\n\"The right to freedom of expression is a fundamental right, but it is not absolute. It is subject to the general prohibition of hate speech and incitement to violence,\" the court said in its ruling.\n\nFacebook's zero-tolerance policy on hate speech has been under scrutiny in recent years, with critics arguing that the platform does not do enough to prevent the spread of hate speech and misinformation. The company has faced criticism for its handling of posts that violate its community standards, particularly in the run-up to elections.\n\nThe court's ruling is expected to have far-reaching implications for social media companies operating in Germany, as they will now be required to provide users with more transparency regarding post removal and account blocking.\n\n\"This is a significant step towards ensuring that social media platforms are held accountable for their actions in removing hate speech and protecting the rights of their users,\" said Jens Markwart, a legal expert at the German Digital Association.\n\nThe debate on toxic discourse on social networks has gained urgency ahead of Germany's general election, scheduled for September 26, 2021. Political parties and advocacy groups have called on social media platforms to do more to prevent the spread of hate speech and misinformation.\n\nThe court's ruling comes as social media companies face increasing pressure to address the issue of toxic discourse on their platforms, particularly in the context of elections. Facebook and other social media companies have faced criticism for their handling of posts that violate community standards, particularly in the run-up to elections.\n\nThe court's ruling is likely to be closely watched by other European countries, which have also been grappling with the issue of hate speech and incitement to violence on social media platforms. The European Union has proposed new regulations that would force social media companies to take down hate speech within 24 hours of being notified or face fines.\n\nIn conclusion, the German Federal Court of Justice's ruling that Facebook acted illegally by taking down racist posts and blocking the author's account without notification or explanation adds complexity to the debate on toxic discourse on social networks ahead of Germany's general election. The court's criticism of Facebook for not committing to inform users about post removal, account blocking reasons, or offering a right of appeal raises questions about how social media platforms can balance free speech with the need to prevent hate speech and incitement to violence.

The disruption started around 8:30 a.m. Pacific Time (PT) or 11:30 a.m. Eastern Time (ET), leaving millions of users unable to access their accounts or use various Facebook services.\n\nThe financial implications of the outage were swiftly calculated by financial analysts. Fortune and Snopes estimated that Facebook lost at least $60 million in revenue during the hours-long outage based on the company's second-quarter earnings report. Facebook generates approximately $319.6 million in revenue per day, making the potential revenue loss significant.\n\nFacebook's ad business, which accounts for the majority of its revenue, was significantly impacted during the outage. Users couldn't engage with content or interact with advertisements, causing a ripple effect through the digital advertising ecosystem.\n\nFacebook acknowledged the outage and issued a statement, \"We're aware that some people are having trouble accessing Facebook at the moment. We're working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible. In the meantime, people can stay connected with friends and family using our apps Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram.\"\n\nServices began to come back online by approximately 3:30 p.m. PT/6:30 p.m. ET on the same day. Facebook expressed gratitude for users' patience and apologized for the inconvenience, stating, \"We appreciate everyone's understanding as we work to resolve this issue.\"\n\nThe outage also had a ripple effect on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's net worth and ranking. Shares of Facebook dropped nearly 5% following the news, reducing Zuckerberg's net worth by an estimated $6 billion.\n\nThe outage led to a broader selloff in social media stocks, affecting shares of Twitter and Snap. Twitter lost about 3% of its value, while Snap saw a 2.5% decline in stock price.\n\nFacebook's outage serves as a reminder of the company's reliance on its digital platforms and the potential financial impact of service disruptions.

The company's founder, Chang Yung-fa, instilled a disciplined culture that led to a remarkable safety record.\n\nStone Huang, Taiwan Managing Director at JAS Worldwide, shared, \"Evergreen has always had a reputation for having a very strict and disciplined management style. This is due in large part to the influence of Chang Yung-fa.\"\n\nThe Suez Canal incident, however, has put this reputation to the test. On March 23, 2021, the Ever Given, a 400-meter-long container ship, ran aground in the canal, causing a major disruption to global maritime trade.\n\nAs investigations into the cause of the accident continue, potential factors include the operator, shipowner, weather conditions, or the canal itself. Evergreen Marine has cited gusty winds as a reason for the ship's deviation from its course.\n\nLiang Kuo-yuan, President of the Polaris Research Institute, commented, \"There's a lot we don't know yet about what happened in the Suez Canal. However, it's clear that this incident has raised questions about the management practices at Evergreen Marine.\"\n\nChang Yung-fa established Evergreen Marine in 1968, and the company has grown to operate over 200 container ships. His disciplined management style, which emphasized safety and efficiency, was instrumental in the company's success.\n\nHowever, after Chang's death in 2002, a dispute over inheritance among his sons was reported. Some observers suggest that the management style at Evergreen may have shifted from its original strictness.\n\nCathy Chin, Chairperson of the Taiwan International Logistics & Supply Chain Association, noted, \"It's important to remember that Evergreen Marine has had an excellent safety record up until this incident. It's too early to say definitively what caused the Ever Given to run aground.\"\n\nThe Suez Canal incident might not significantly damage Evergreen's reputation due to the high demand for sea freight. Stone Huang explained, \"There's always going to be a demand for shipping services, and companies like Evergreen will continue to play a crucial role in global trade.\"\n\nDespite this, the incident raises questions about the appropriateness of large vessels for certain shipping routes. Liang Kuo-yuan observed, \"The Suez Canal is a narrow and complex waterway. It may be time to reconsider the size and design of vessels that use it.\"\n\nStone Huang added, \"Safety should always be the top priority for shipping companies. It's essential that lessons are learned from incidents like this to prevent similar occurrences in the future.\"\n\nAs the investigations into the Ever Given's grounding continue, it remains to be seen what role, if any, Evergreen Marine's management practices played in the incident. One thing is clear, though: the shipping industry will be watching closely to see how Evergreen responds.\n\nConclusion: The Suez Canal incident has put the strict management style of Evergreen Marine under scrutiny. While the cause of the Ever Given's grounding is still being investigated, some observers suggest that the company's management practices may have shifted since the death of its founder, Chang Yung-fa. Despite this, Evergreen's reputation may not be significantly damaged due to the high demand for sea freight. The incident, however, raises questions about the appropriateness of large vessels for certain shipping routes and the importance of safety in the shipping industry."}

Among the devastating consequences was a house fire that claimed the lives of three young children and their grandmother, leaving behind a grieving mother and her friend, both critically injured.\n\nJackie Pham Nguyen, the mother of the children, and her friend Mai Bui, were rushed to the hospital with major burns. They remain in stable condition but are facing a long and arduous recovery. Survived by, Nguyen, her mother, Loan Le, was also in the house when the fire broke out due to a power outage at her residence.\n\nSugar Land Fire Department responded to the scene around 2:15 a.m., with firefighters battling the blaze for hours.

Here's what you need to know about the payments and what's next for families.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has sent out the third round of Economic Impact Payments to eligible individuals based on their 2019 or 2020 tax filings. The payments, which totaled up to $1,400 for individuals and $2,800 for married couples, were designed to help Americans cope with the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHowever, no more monthly Child Tax Credit payments are planned for 2022. The expanded Child Tax Credit benefits, which provided up to $3,600 per child under the age of 6 and up to $3,000 per child between the ages of 6 and 17, have been a lifeline for many families.\n\nSome families, however, may be eligible for \"plus-up\" payments based on changes noted in their 2020 tax filings. These changes include lower income or having a child. The IRS will send out \"plus-up\" payments until December 31, based on the legislative deadline.\n\nIt's important to note that Economic Impact Payments are available for individuals making $75,000 or less, or married couples making $150,000 or less. If you believe you are eligible but haven't received a payment, you can use the IRS's Get My Payment tool to check your payment status.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, are planning to continue efforts to extend the Child Tax Credit payments into 2022. A one-year extension of the Child Tax Credit would cost an estimated $185 billion, while extending the credit for 10 years would cost approximately $1.6 trillion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\n\nPresident Biden has expressed support for extending the Child Tax Credit, but it remains to be seen whether Democrats will be able to pass the legislation in a divided Congress. In the meantime, families are encouraged to take advantage of the expanded benefits while they last.\n\nAs the year comes to a close, it's important for families to understand the timeline for these payments and what to expect moving forward. The IRS has provided resources and tools to help individuals check their payment status and ensure they are receiving the benefits they are eligible for.\n\nIn conclusion, the American Rescue Plan's stimulus check payments and expanded Child Tax Credit benefits are coming to an end in 2021. While some families may be eligible for \"plus-up\" payments based on changes to their income or family size, it remains to be seen whether Democrats will be able to extend the Child Tax Credit into 2022. In the meantime, families are encouraged to take advantage of the benefits while they last and to stay informed about any updates to the legislation."}

The jury's verdict came after approximately 26 hours of deliberation, concluding a deeply divisive trial that ignited a national debate over vigilantism, gun rights, and self-defense.\n\nThomas Binger, the lead prosecutor, expressed disappointment in the jury's decision, stating, \"Obviously, we're very disappointed in the outcome, but we respect the jury's decision.\" Rittenhouse, who cried and hugged his lawyers after the verdict was read, declared himself not guilty on multiple counts, including first-degree reckless homicide, first-degree intentional homicide, and attempted first-degree intentional homicide.\n\nGovernor Gavin Newsom of California criticized the verdict, tweeting, \"Another American community reeling from a senseless act of gun violence. My heart goes out to the families of Anthony Huber, Gaige Grosskreutz, and Joseph Rosenbaum.\" President Biden also expressed concern but urged for peaceful acceptance, stating, \"While the verdict in Kenosha will leave many Americans feeling angry and concerned, myself included, we must acknowledge that the jury has spoken.\"\n\nSenator Ron Johnson (R-WI) and Rebecca Kleefisch, the Republican candidate for Wisconsin governor, praised the jury's decision, with Johnson stating, \"The jury's verdict reflects the law and the facts of the case.

The prosecution attempted to portray Rittenhouse as an instigator, while the defense and verdict supported the notion of self-defense. Regardless of the outcome, the trial and subsequent verdict will continue to fuel the ongoing national conversation surrounding gun rights, self-defense, and the role of citizens in maintaining order during civil unrest."}

Ilhan Omar (D-MN) led a group of House Democrats in sending a letter to President Joe Biden on Monday urging him to include recurring direct payments and automatic unemployment insurance extensions in his proposed relief bill. \"The economic crisis caused by this pandemic is far from over,\" Omar said in a statement. \"Congress must act now to ensure that families have the resources they need to get through this crisis.\"\n\nSenate Democrats, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), plan to send a similar letter to Biden, according to a source familiar with the matter. While there is no specified dollar amount or frequency for the stimulus checks mentioned in the upcoming Senate Democrats' letter, Sanders has been a vocal advocate for monthly payments of $2,000. \"We cannot allow millions of working-class families to go hungry or be evicted while corporate America continues to rake in record profits,\" Sanders said in a statement to Forbes.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Senate is considering Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus package, which includes a one-time, $1,400 stimulus check. According to the Urban Institute, a one-time $1,200 stimulus check and enhanced unemployment insurance could prevent 12 million people from falling into poverty.\n\nHowever, Senate Republicans and some moderate Democrats like Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) are unlikely to support monthly $2,000 stimulus checks. Manchin told reporters on Monday that he would not support recurring checks, arguing that the focus should be on getting people back to work. \"We need to focus on getting people jobs,\" Manchin said. \"We can't keep giving checks out every two weeks or every month.\"\n\nPresident Biden, a moderate Democrat, is seen as unlikely to support the proposal for recurring checks, according to sources familiar with his thinking. Instead, Biden is expected to focus on getting a relief bill passed as soon as possible.\n\nSupporters of the recurring payments argue that 65% of Americans, including majorities of Republicans and independents, favor them. A recent poll by Data for Progress found that 71% of Americans support recurring stimulus checks until the economy recovers. \"The American people overwhelmingly support recurring direct payments,\" Warren said in a statement. \"It's time for Congress to listen to them and act.\"\n\nThe debate over recurring stimulus checks comes as the pandemic continues to take a toll on the economy, with millions of Americans still out of work and struggling to make ends meet. The U.S. added just 49,000 jobs in January, falling far short of expectations.\n\n\"The economy is still in a deep hole, and we need to do everything we can to help working families make it through this crisis,\" Omar said. \"Recurring direct payments and automatic unemployment insurance extensions tied to economic conditions are the best way to do that.\"\n\nSanders and Warren are expected to push for recurring payments as part of Biden's relief package, but it remains to be seen whether they will be able to win over enough support from their colleagues to include them in the final bill.\n\nIn the meantime, Democrats are urging Biden to act quickly to get relief to the American people. \"The longer we wait, the more people will suffer,\" Omar said. \"We cannot afford to wait any longer.\""}

Samirah's comments were in response to the Sunrise Movement's call to boycott a rally due to the participation of Jewish movements with Israel ties.\n\nIn one tweet, Samirah referenced a Guardian article alleging Mossad's role in creating wars but acknowledged that the article did not support his claim. He further blamed Israel for the 1980s Iran-Iraq war, citing a 1986 New York Times article about Israel's weapons deals with the Shah of Iran.\n\nBoris Epshteyn, a Jewish adviser to former President Donald Trump, questioned the silence from Jewish Democratic groups regarding Samirah's remarks. \"Silence is complicity.

However, a closer look at the evidence presented reveals a more nuanced truth.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge the inaccuracies in the portrayal of the British press during the interview. Veteran royal reporter Robert Jobson, currently with the Evening Standard, advised me to \"take a deep breath and ignore the sensationalist headlines from blogs and foreign media.\" More than a third of the 'racist' headlines shown during the interview were, in fact, from these sources, not the British press.\n\nSecondly, it's worth noting that the British press adheres to the Independent Press Standards Organisation's (IPSO) Code of Conduct, which includes rules against racial prejudice and harassment. In the context of this interview, it's contradictory for Harry and Meghan to claim they've been silenced while actively making complaints and taking legal actions against the media.\n\nJobson, who has covered the royals for decades, shared his perspective on the situation: \"The British press, for all its faults, does have a system in place to hold itself accountable. The same can't be said for blogs and foreign media.\"\n\nAs journalists, we must balance scrutiny and accountability. The public has a right to know the truth, but it's equally important to respect individuals' privacy and dignity. The personal safety and professional integrity of journalists are under threat amidst severe online criticism and trolling following the interview. Jobson warned, \"Ignoring the trolls is the only way to stay sane and focused on reporting the facts.\"\n\nThe recent departure of Piers Morgan from Good Morning Britain, instigated by a complaint from Meghan, raises concerns about the impact on freedom of speech. Morgan's outspoken opinions were a staple of the show, and his removal sends a chilling message to the media.\n\nMoreover, there's a perceived hypocrisy in the public's response to accusations against Meghan compared to others. While Meghan's experiences are undeniably distressing, they should not overshadow the very real struggles faced by other public figures subjected to similar, if not worse, scrutiny.\n\nTo maintain journalistic responsibility and accountability, it's crucial to scrutinize public figures' claims. However, we must also be mindful of the potential for misinformation and manipulation. As journalists, we have a duty to the truth and to our readers, and it's essential that we remain impartial and objective in our reporting.\n\nIn closing, the Harry and Meghan interview served as a stark reminder of the power and influence of the media. It's crucial that we continue to strive for accuracy, fairness, and professionalism in our reporting, while also acknowledging the importance of scrutinizing public figures' claims. As Robert Jobson wisely put it, \"The truth will always come out, but it's up to us as journalists to ensure it does so in a responsible and ethical manner.\""}

Andrew Cuomo's, defense against sexual misconduct allegations.\n\nIn a statement, CNN said, \"The New York Attorney General's office released transcripts and exhibits Monday that shed new light on Chris Cuomo's involvement in his brother's defense. The documents, which we were not privy to before their public release, raise serious questions. When Chris admitted to us that he had offered advice to his brother's staff, he broke our rules and we acknowledged that publicly. But we also appreciated the unique position he was in and understood his need to put family first and job second. However, these documents point to a greater involvement in his brother's efforts than we previously knew. As a result, we have suspended Chris indefinitely, pending further evaluation.\"\n\nAnderson Cooper's show, \"Anderson Cooper 360,\" was immediately extended to fill Cuomo's prime time slot following the suspension announcement.\n\nIn a statement on his SiriusXM show, Chris Cuomo addressed his suspension, expressing embarrassment but stating he understands CNN's decision. \"I never intended for any of my actions to end up in the way they did. I never inquired about the specifics of any allegation against my brother nor did I attempt to cover up any allegation or conceal the truth. But I should not have allowed my involvement in my brother's situation to interfere with my ability to report objectively about the political implications of the allegations.\"\n\nThe documents disclosed include text messages and interviews detailing Chris Cuomo's efforts to assist his brother's defense and use his media connections inappropriately. For instance, in one text message, Cuomo wrote, \"Only thing we got is stuck on this [expletive] story. He's being pursued by three different women who all say he groped them. The latest took a picture of his [expletive] to prove it. I'll help you out.\"\n\nPreviously, Chris Cuomo had admitted to giving advice to his brother's staff but claimed he did not attempt to influence CNN's coverage of his brother's scandal. However, voices both internally and externally have emerged criticizing Cuomo for violating journalistic norms and ethics.\n\nNo specific details have been shared about the duration of the suspension or who will permanently fill Cuomo's time slot.\n\nThe revelations are part of broader investigations into Andrew Cuomo's conduct, including potential misuse of state resources. In response to the release of the documents, Rich Azzopardi, a spokesperson for Andrew Cuomo, criticized the move as politically motivated. \"This is all politically motivated. The fact that other reporters in the media are being used in a political game is disgusting,\" Azzopardi said in a statement.\n\nCNN's decision comes as the network faces increased scrutiny over its handling of the Chris Cuomo situation. Earlier this month, the network faced backlash for initially defending Cuomo's involvement in his brother's defense, with some critics arguing it represented a conflict of interest. However, the release of the documents appears to have changed the calculus for CNN executives."}

Although there have been calls on social media for Trump's supporters to gather at the tech giant's offices, no official announcement of a mass demonstration has been made.\n\nAccording to local reports, Twitter employees have been working remotely since March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, significantly reducing the number of people at the headquarters. In a statement, a Twitter company spokesperson said, \"We respect the right to express views, but we will continue to enforce our rules against glorifying violence.\"\n\nThe suspension of Trump's account came after last week's violent breach of the U.S. Capitol, which resulted in five fatalities. Twitter cited the risk of further incitement to violence as the reason for the permanent ban. The spokesperson further explained, \"Our decision to suspend @realDonaldTrump was made after careful consideration of the context around his tweets and the ongoing potential for violence.\"\n\nIn anticipation of the rally, San Francisco police have plans in place, including mutual aid from nearby law enforcement agencies if necessary. A spokesperson for the San Francisco Police Department stated, \"We will work closely with Twitter and other relevant organizations to ensure public safety during any potential demonstrations.\"\n\nTwitter is not alone in taking action against the former president. Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, and YouTube have also suspended Trump's accounts. Amazon, Apple, and Google removed the pro-Trump app Parler from their platforms, citing violations of their respective policies.\n\nReacting to these developments, a Twitter spokesperson commented, \"Social media platforms have a responsibility to enforce their rules and protect the public from harmful content. Twitter's decision to suspend President Trump's account is part of our ongoing commitment to upholding these standards.\"\n\nThe decision to suspend Trump's account has been met with controversy, with some arguing that it infringes on the former president's right to free speech. However, Twitter and other platforms argue that their actions are necessary to maintain a safe and inclusive online environment.\n\nA Twitter spokesperson explained, \"We understand that some may disagree with our decision. However, we believe that it is essential to uphold our rules against glorifying violence and maintaining a safe and inclusive platform for all users.\"\n\nAs the date of the potential rally approaches, tensions remain high, with both supporters and opponents of the former president expressing their views on social media. The situation underscores the ongoing debate about the role of social media platforms in shaping public discourse and enforcing their content policies.\n\nA Twitter spokesperson reiterated the company's stance, stating, \"We will continue to enforce our rules and take action against content that violates our policies. Our commitment to maintaining a safe and inclusive platform for all users remains our top priority.\"\n\nIn the meantime, San Francisco police are urging the public to stay informed about the situation and follow any instructions from law enforcement officials if they choose to attend the rally. The spokesperson for the San Francisco Police Department emphasized, \"Public safety is our top priority. We encourage everyone to exercise their First Amendment rights peacefully and responsibly.\""}

Lauren Boebert Sparks Outrage with Controversial Alec Baldwin T-Shirt\n\nColorado Republican Congresswoman Lauren Boebert has ignited a firestorm of controversy with her latest political statement, wearing a t-shirt referencing Alec Baldwin and the tragic shooting on the set of the film \"Rust.\"\n\nThe t-shirt, which bears the message \"GUNS DON'T KILL PEOPLE ALEC BALDWIN DOES,\" has been widely criticized as disrespectful towards Halyna Hutchins, the cinematographer who was killed by Baldwin's prop gun last October.\n\nMarty Lindsey, an actor on \"Rust,\" expressed his disgust with Boebert's actions in a statement to Colorado Public Radio. \"It's unconscionable that anyone, let alone a sitting member of Congress, would make light of a tragedy that took the life of a beloved colleague and mother,\" he said. \"This behavior shows a blatant disregard not only for Halyna and her family but for the entire film community.\"\n\nThe incident that Boebert's t-shirt references occurred on October 21, 2021, when Baldwin discharged a prop gun during rehearsals for \"Rust,\" killing Hutchins and injuring director Joel Souza. Baldwin has since been charged with involuntary manslaughter in connection with Hutchins' death.\n\nBoebert's office has not commented on the matter. However, this is not the first time the congresswoman has mocked Baldwin since the incident. The day after Hutchins' death, Boebert tweeted, \"Alec Baldwin calls for an end to filibuster but forgets about halting production on 'Rust' movie after fatal shooting.\"\n\nThe controversy surrounding Boebert's t-shirt does not end there. A similar shirt is available in an online store run by Donald Trump Jr. Boebert has a history of using clothing to make political statements. In 2019, she wore a t-shirt that read \"Workout gear not a hijab\" during a debate with her Democratic opponent, Diane Mitsch Bush.\n\nLindsey, who is also from Colorado, expressed disappointment in Boebert's connection to the state. \"As fellow Coloradans, I had hoped for better from someone in a position of power,\" he said. \"Instead, we have a representative who uses tragedy to score cheap political points.\"\n\nThe shooting on the set of \"Rust\" continues to reverberate through the film industry and beyond. The Hutchins family has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Baldwin and others involved in the production. The tragedy has also sparked renewed calls for stricter gun safety protocols on film sets.\n\nIn the wake of Boebert's controversial t-shirt, it's clear that the impact of the \"Rust\" shooting will continue to be felt for a long time to come."}

According to Texas officials, 151 deaths were confirmed in the aftermath of the storm. However, a data review by BuzzFeed News suggests the actual number could be much higher.\n\nBuzzFeed used an 'excess fatalities' analysis, comparing deaths during the storm to those during normal conditions, and estimated that between 426 and 978 more deaths may have occurred during the storm. The analysis also estimated that as many as 702 people could have died during the storm week alone.\n\nNeighboring states with similar storm impact but without Texas's widespread power outages did not see a spike in deaths, raising questions about the role of power outages in the increased mortality rate. Those who died were often medically vulnerable people with conditions like cardiovascular disease and diabetes.\n\nIn Harris County alone, at least 66 deaths were reported due to the storm. The county, which is home to Houston, the fourth-largest city in the United States, accounted for a significant portion of the state's storm-related fatalities. Thousands more were left without power, exacerbating conditions for residents.\n\nTexas lawmakers are considering legislation aimed at preventing future blackouts, including Senate Bill 3. The bill would require power companies to winterize their infrastructure and face penalties if they fail to do so. However, there are concerns that the proposed legislation may not sufficiently ensure winterization of the state's natural gas infrastructure, which played a significant role in the power outages.\n\nThe electric grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), has faced criticism for its handling of the crisis. ERCOT has defended its actions, stating that the extreme weather conditions were beyond its control. However, some experts argue that the grid was not adequately prepared for such extreme weather.\n\nThe storm highlighted the vulnerabilities of Texas's power grid and the need for more robust infrastructure to withstand extreme weather events. The human toll of the crisis serves as a reminder of the importance of ensuring access to basic necessities like electricity and heat, especially during times of crisis. The long-term impact of the storm on Texas and its residents remains to be seen."}

The error, described as one of the biggest blunders in banking history, has raised concerns over the outdated user interfaces in the financial sector and the risks of human error.\n\nAlex Khmelevskiy, the head of UX design at Clay, a fintech firm, weighed in on the incident, criticizing Citigroup's wire transfer system as \"outdated\" and \"in dire need of an update.\" Khmelevskiy stated, \"The financial industry needs to modernize its interfaces to minimize the risk of human error and ensure a seamless user experience.\"\n\nA Citigroup spokesperson acknowledged the mistake, stating, \"We apologize for the error and are working diligently to correct the issue. We have added significant controls to our loan operations platform until the new system is operational.\"\n\nOracle, the interface provider for Citigroup's Flexcube system, declined to comment on the situation.\n\nThe mistake occurred during a process to transfer a $7.8 million interest payment from Citigroup to Revlon creditors. However, the full loan amount of $507 million was mistakenly sent instead.\n\nAccording to reports, a subcontractor in India was responsible for the error. The subcontractor incorrectly checked boxes during the transaction setup, causing the full loan amount to be transferred instead of the intended interest payment.\n\nJudge Jesse Furman, presiding over the case, ruled that Citigroup cannot recoup the $500 million mistakenly sent to the creditors. The judge stated, \"It was reasonable for the creditors to keep the funds, given that they were unaware of the error and acted in good faith.\"\n\nSpeaking on the ruling, Judge Furman expressed hope that other banks would learn from Citigroup's mistake and take steps to minimize error risks. He stated, \"This incident underscores the importance of having robust systems in place to prevent such errors and the need for regular updates and maintenance.\"\n\nKhmelevskiy further commented on the incident, stating, \"This is a stark reminder of the risks associated with outdated interfaces and the need for financial institutions to prioritize user experience and interface design.\"\n\nCitigroup's mistake follows a series of high-profile errors in the financial sector, including a $170 million error by JPMorgan Chase in 2012 and a $6 billion error by HSBC in 2011.\n\nIndustry experts believe that the increasing complexity of financial transactions and the reliance on third-party applications and subcontractors increase the risks of errors.\n\nCitigroup is not the first bank to experience interface-related issues. In 2018, Wells Fargo experienced a similar issue when it mistakenly wired $820,000 to the wrong account.\n\nThe incident has raised questions about the role of human error in financial transactions and the need for banks to invest in user-friendly interfaces and robust error prevention systems.\n\nCitigroup has not disclosed the financial impact of the error on its bottom line, but analysts believe that the bank could face significant losses and reputational damage.\n\nAs the financial industry continues to evolve, the need for modern, user-friendly interfaces and robust error prevention systems has never been more critical. The Citigroup incident serves as a reminder of the risks associated with outdated systems and the importance of prioritizing user experience and interface design.\n\nQuote from Alex Khmelevskiy: \"The financial industry needs to modernize its interfaces to minimize the risk of human error and ensure a seamless user experience.\"\n\nQuote from Citigroup spokesperson: \"We apologize for the error and are working diligently to correct the issue.

We will forever cherish the memories we made together.\" The room filled with the sound of sniffles and quiet sobs as the family members spoke.\n\nAn empty urn sat at the front of the room during the service, as the FBI has not yet released Gabby's body to her family for burial. The absence of her physical remains did little to dampen the spirit of the gathering.\n\nJoseph Petito urged those in attendance to live their lives fully and leave unhealthy relationships behind. \"Gabby would want us all to be happy and to live life to the fullest,\" he said. \"Let's honor her memory by doing just that.\"\n\nCorissa Ambrose, an acquaintance of Gabby's, shared her thoughts on the free-spirited and kind-hearted young woman. \"She was always so full of life and had a smile that could light up a room,\" she said, her voice shaking with emotion.\n\nThe Petito family has requested that, in lieu of flowers, donations be made to the Gabby Petito Foundation. The organization aims to help bring missing children home safely.\n\nGabby Petito was reported missing over two weeks before her memorial service, and her death has been ruled a homicide. Her remains were discovered in the Bridger-Teton National Forest, and her last social media post was on August 25.\n\nThe somber event was preceded by a vigil in North Port, Florida, where around 200 people gathered to honor Gabby's life and remember the joy she brought to their community.\n\n\"She was a shining star in our town,\" said North Port Mayor Jill Luke at the vigil. \"Her spirit will live on in all of us.\"\n\nGabby's fiancé, Brian Laundrie, is considered a person of interest in her death, and a federal arrest warrant has been issued for him in connection with the case.\n\nJoseph Petito expressed his gratitude for the support his family has received during this difficult time. \"We've been overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and support from our community and from people all over the world,\" he said.\n\nCorissa Ambrose spoke of Gabby's infectious laughter and her love for adventure. \"She lived every day like it was her last,\" she said. \"She will be deeply missed by all of us who knew and loved her.\"\n\nJim Schmidt shared memories of Gabby's childhood and her close relationship with her mother, Nicole Schmidt. \"She was a daddy's girl, but she and her mom were incredibly close,\" he said. \"They did everything together.\"\n\nThe memorial service concluded with the release of white doves, symbolizing Gabby's free spirit and the hope that she will continue to watch over her loved ones.\n\nOutside the funeral home, mourners gathered to share their memories of Gabby and to offer words of comfort to the Petito family. \"She touched so many lives,\" said one woman, tears streaming down her face.\n\nThe Petito family expressed their appreciation for the community's support and asked for privacy during this difficult time. \"We just want to be able to grieve in peace,\" Joseph said.\n\nCorissa Ambrose shared a story about how Gabby had helped her through a difficult time in her life. \"She was always there for me, no matter what,\" she said. \"I know she's looking down on us now, sending us love and strength.\"\n\nFriends and family members exchanged hugs and tears as they parted ways, each carrying the memory of Gabby Petito in their hearts.\n\nAs the sun began to set on the day of Gabby's memorial service, the Petito family and their loved ones gathered for a final moment of reflection. \"She may be gone, but she will never be forgotten,\" Joseph said, his voice filled with emotion.\n\nThe investigation into Gabby's death continues, with the FBI and local law enforcement working diligently to bring those responsible to justice.\n\nThe Petito family has set up a GoFundMe page to help cover the costs of Gabby's funeral and memorial services.

I have asked the Intelligence Community Inspectors General to review these matters and determine the extent to which these actions were taken, who was involved, and what, if any, accountability measures were taken.\"\n\nThe committee has since reached out to the CIA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) for any relevant information regarding these allegations. The committee's inquiry comes on the heels of a Yahoo News report that detailed plans to kidnap Assange from the Ecuadorian embassy in London in 2017.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and over 20 other organizations have urged Attorney General Merrick Garland to drop Assange's prosecution based on these revelations. Assange's lawyers also plan to use the CIA's alleged misconduct to argue against his extradition from the UK to the US.\n\nFormer CIA Director Mike Pompeo, who was reportedly pushing for aggressive measures against WikiLeaks, including considering assassination, acknowledged some truth in the Yahoo News story but denied any illegal plans to assassinate Assange. In a statement to Yahoo News, Pompeo said, \"There is no truth to the allegation that the CIA was planning or considering plans to assassinate Julian Assange. I will always protect the men and women of the CIA, past and present, and I have faith that they will continue to follow their sworn oaths to uphold the Constitution.\"\n\nHowever, White House lawyers reportedly vetoed the kidnapping plan, but other operations targeting WikiLeaks went ahead.

Haugen, a data scientist, applied for federal whistleblower protection before going public with her concerns about Facebook's algorithms and policies.\n\nFrances Haugen: \"The company's leadership knows how to make Facebook and Instagram safer but won't make the necessary changes because they have put their astronomical profits before people.\"\n\nHaugen's disclosures paint a damning picture of Facebook's internal workings. She detailed how the company's algorithms can harm teenagers' mental health, leading to a pause in the development of Instagram Kids. Haugen was particularly vocal about the negative impacts of Instagram on teenagers, stating that \"Facebook, as part of an internal research project, manually chose a sample of teenagers and monitored their usage of the app. They found that among the teens who reported feeling unhappy, 13% of Instagram users and 6% of TikTok users reported wanting to kill themselves within the last year, compared with 4% of Snapchat users and 3% of young Facebook users.\"\n\nMoreover, Haugen accused Facebook of promoting divisive and hateful content because it increases engagement. She claimed that Facebook's internal actions contradicted its public statements on combating misinformation and violent extremism.\n\nFrances Haugen: \"Facebook has consistently blamed its algorithms for allowing the spread of hate speech, violent content, and misinformation. The documents show that, in reality, Facebook's executives have full knowledge of how their platforms are being used to divide society and spread harmful content.\"\n\nDespite her criticisms, Haugen expressed empathy towards Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, stating that she believes he cares about doing the right thing. However, she argued that Facebook's current leadership structure, with Zuckerberg holding ultimate decision-making power, is a significant problem.\n\nFrances Haugen: \"Mark [Zuckerberg] is an incredibly capable leader, and I think he genuinely wants Facebook to be a force for good. But I believe that Facebook's current leadership structure and the current business model create an inherent conflict between what's good for Facebook and what's good for society.\"\n\nShortly after Haugen's revelations, Facebook experienced a nearly 7-hour outage due to a \"faulty configuration change.\" The outage, which affected Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, was one of the longest in the company's history. Some critics suggested that the outage was a coincidence, while others saw it as a possible attempt to distract from Haugen's allegations.\n\nThe fallout from Haugen's disclosures continues to unfold, with calls for increased regulation of tech companies growing louder. As the situation develops, it remains to be seen how Facebook will respond and what impact Haugen's revelations will have on the tech industry as a whole. One thing is certain: the public's perception of Facebook has been forever changed."}

They want to create chaos in Afghanistan to justify their continued presence.\" The Taliban, who seized control of Afghanistan following the withdrawal of U.S. and Western troops, insists they have the capability to control terrorism within their borders.\n\nHowever, ISIS-K, an Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan, claimed responsibility for the attack, releasing a statement asserting, \"The bombing at Kabul airport was carried out by the soldiers of the Islamic State.\" The group, which opposes both the Taliban and the U.S., continues to present a significant threat to stability in Afghanistan.\n\nKarimi criticized the U.S. evacuation strategy, attributing the airport attack to poor planning. He promised that the Taliban would not harm Spanish nationals and encouraged knowledgeable individuals to contribute to Afghanistan's prosperity. The Taliban asserts that foreign nationals are forgiven and can lead normal lives, including the opportunity to leave the country legally when the situation normalizes.\n\nDespite historical restrictions, the Taliban claims to support equal rights for women to study and work, provided they comply with Islamic law. Karimi emphasized the importance of women wearing hijabs and adhering to Islamic dress codes to prevent \"provoking men.\"\n\nAcross Afghanistan, women have protested against the Taliban's conservative laws, facing militant crackdowns. One protester, speaking anonymously for fear of reprisals, expressed her frustration, stating, \"We will not be silenced. We will continue to fight for our rights and the future of our country.\"\n\nThe Taliban's rapid takeover of Afghanistan followed the withdrawal of U.S. and Western troops, ending over two decades of military presence. The U.S. had invaded Afghanistan in response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, which were orchestrated by Al-Qaeda, a militant group harbored by the Taliban.\n\nDespite the Taliban's blame, ISIS-K has already claimed responsibility for the deadly attack at Kabul airport. The group has a history of carrying out high-profile attacks against both the Taliban and Western forces.\n\nKarimi reiterated the Taliban's commitment to providing security and stability to Afghanistan, stating, \"We understand the concerns of the international community, and we will work to address them. The people of Afghanistan deserve peace and prosperity, and we are committed to delivering that.\"\n\nAs the world watches Afghanistan's uncertain future, the Taliban and ISIS-K continue their tug-of-war for control, with innocent civilians caught in the crossfire.

The summit's objectives include vaccinating the world, saving lives now, building back better, and calling the world to account through measurable targets.\n\nAt the summit, President Biden announced the U.S. will donate an additional 500 million Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines to low and lower-middle-income countries, bringing the total U.S. commitment to over 1.1 billion doses. This historic donation will help save lives, protect communities, and contribute to the global effort to end the pandemic.\n\nThe U.S. is also providing additional funding to enhance global vaccine readiness and delivery. Through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), nearly $1.4 billion will be provided to mitigate COVID-19 impacts and strengthen health systems.

These investments will help increase the supply of vaccines and ensure equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines around the world.\n\nThe U.S. calls for expanding global and regional production of COVID-19 vaccines and enhancing transparency about vaccine availability. Transparency is essential to ensuring that vaccines are distributed equitably and that countries have the information they need to make informed decisions about their response to the pandemic.\n\nPresident Biden reiterated the U.S. support for a temporary waiver of intellectual property protections under the WTO's TRIPS Agreement for COVID-19 vaccines. This waiver would help increase vaccine production capacity and ensure equitable access to vaccines for all countries.\n\nThe Global COVID-19 Summit emphasizes global cooperation and urgency in addressing the pandemic and preparing for future health crises.

However, a fourth federal stimulus check, as evidenced by a petition with over 2.9 million signatures requesting $2,000 recurring payments, is unlikely to materialize in the near future.\n\nJen Psaki, White House Press Secretary, addressed the possibility of additional federal stimulus checks during a press briefing, stating, \"The President strongly believes that the American Rescue Plan is the most effective tool to address the crisis at this moment, and his focus is on getting this relief to the American people as quickly as possible.\"\n\nDespite the lack of federal action, several state governments have taken matters into their own hands to provide additional financial relief. In California, for instance, millions of residents are receiving a second Golden State Stimulus check, with payments ranging from $600 to $1,100. This initiative aims to support low-income residents who have been impacted by the pandemic.\n\nIn Maryland, low-income individuals and families are eligible for direct payments of $300 or $500. Additionally, educators in states like Florida, Michigan, and Tennessee have received bonuses to help offset the challenges they have faced during the pandemic.\n\nAdvance monthly child tax credit payments of up to $300 per child have continued through December as part of the American Rescue Plan. Discussions surrounding future aid packages in federal budget proposals have also included the possibility of extending these payments. Families qualifying for the expanded child tax credit can receive up to $3,600 per child, with the option to receive these payments monthly or in a lump sum.\n\nMeanwhile, third stimulus payments of up to $1,400 are still being distributed. These payments include 'plus-up' payments for individuals who have experienced income changes since filing their taxes and provisions for new dependents in 2021.\n\nCalifornia's Golden State Stimulus I and II are also targeted at supporting low-income residents, with one-time payments of $600 or $1,100 being distributed. Maryland has issued payments to individuals and families claiming the earned income tax credit and provided additional support for the unemployed and small businesses.\n\nFront-line workers in Vermont have received hazard pay for their early pandemic work, and educators in several states have received bonus payments to help offset the challenges they have faced during the pandemic.\n\nWhile the first three stimulus checks have gone a long way in reducing financial hardships for many Americans, current federal proposals do not include further direct payments.

This decision comes after a thorough safety review by medical and scientific teams from both agencies.\n\nThe pause was initially recommended on April 13, 2021, following reports of six cases of a rare and severe type of blood clot, known as thrombosis-thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), occurring in individuals after receiving the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine.\n\n\"Safety is our top priority,\" said Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock, M.D. \"Throughout this process, we have been working closely with the CDC and other public health partners to assess the benefits and risks of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. Based on the available data, we have found that the vaccine's benefits in preventing COVID-19 outweigh the risks of TTS for individuals 18 years of age and older.\"\n\nCDC Director Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky shared similar sentiments, \"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose a serious public health threat to the United States and around the world. The Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines have demonstrated excellent safety and efficacy, and we encourage all eligible Americans to get vaccinated with these vaccines. However, the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine also plays an important role in preventing COVID-19, and the available data show that the vaccine's benefits outweigh its known and potential risks.\"\n\nDuring the pause, the FDA and CDC conducted an extensive review of available data, assessed risks, and provided outreach to healthcare providers to ensure they had the most up-to-date information on the vaccine and TTS.\n\nThe data suggest that the chance of TTS occurring is very low. According to the CDC, as of May 7, 2021, a total of 15 cases of TTS have been reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), all in women aged between 18 and 59 years.\n\nTo help healthcare providers and vaccine recipients better understand the risks associated with the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine, the FDA and CDC have revised the vaccine's fact sheet to include information about TTS.\n\nThe CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has also reviewed the latest data on TTS and reaffirmed its recommendation that the benefits of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine outweigh its known and potential risks for individuals 18 years of age and older.\n\n\"We understand that this pause may have caused concern and confusion, but we want to assure the American people that we take all reports of adverse events following vaccination seriously,\" said Dr. Walensky. \"Our vaccine safety systems are working. We encourage people to consult their healthcare providers with any questions or concerns they may have about vaccines, including the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine.\"\n\n\"We will continue to monitor the safety of COVID-19 vaccines closely,\" emphasized Acting FDA Commissioner Woodcock. \"We have robust safety monitoring systems in place, and we will continue to work with our public health partners to ensure the American people have access to safe and effective vaccines.\"\n\nThe FDA, CDC, and other public health partners will continue to provide updates as more information becomes available.

Hatley was identified through witnesses, photographs, and a cellphone tracking app, according to a statement from the FBI's Washington Field Office.\n\nFederal authorities contacted Hatley on Jan. 12, and criminal charges were filed against him on Jan. 15. Hatley faces charges including entering a restricted building without authority and impeding government business.\n\nAgent Don Wood, spokesperson for the FBI's Columbia field office, confirmed Hatley's arrest but stated, \"The FBI's Columbia field office had no substantial involvement in Hatley's investigation. The FBI's Washington Field Office led the investigation.\"\n\nHatley's presence at the Capitol was verified through the use of the 'Life360' location-tracking app, according to the FBI's statement. The app, which is often used by families to monitor each other's locations, placed Hatley near the Capitol during the riot.\n\nA witness provided the FBI with photographs of Hatley inside the Capitol building. In one photograph, Hatley can be seen taking a selfie in front of a statue of John C. Calhoun.\n\n\"The FBI is committed to holding accountable those who participated in the violent assault on the Capitol on January 6,\" said Steven D'Antuono, Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI's Washington Field Office. \"Through the tireless efforts of our investigators and our partners, we continue to identify, locate, and apprehend individuals who attacked the Capitol.\"\n\nMore than 200 people have been charged in connection to the Jan. 6 riot, which resulted in five deaths. Authorities are still working to identify and apprehend those involved.\n\nIn a now-deleted Facebook post, Hatley denied involvement in breaching the Capitol. \"I did not storm the Capitol, nor did I damage any property,\" Hatley wrote. \"I peacefully protested with thousands of other Americans for hours before leaving the area.\"\n\nThe FBI is urging anyone with information regarding the Capitol riot to come forward.

The booster dose may be administered at least six months after completion of the primary series.\n\nActing FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock, M.D., emphasized the importance of vaccinations and boosters in combating the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, stating, \"Expanding the eligibility for a booster dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine to 16- and 17-year-olds is an important step in our ongoing efforts to protect the most vulnerable populations from this continuing pandemic. We understand that the science continues to evolve regarding COVID-19 vaccines, and we will continue working with our partners at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to help the American people make informed decisions about their health.\"\n\nPeter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, cited waning vaccine effectiveness as the rationale for authorizing booster doses for this age group. He explained, \"Based on the available data, we believe that the benefits of a booster dose outweigh the risks for 16- and 17-year-olds. We have seen waning vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic COVID-19 infection in the 16- to 17-year-old age group, and a booster dose can help provide an additional layer of protection.\"\n\nThe FDA's analysis of immune response data supports the effectiveness of a booster dose in youth and adults. Marks continued, \"Our analysis of the data shows that the immune response following a booster dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine in 16- and 17-year-olds is similar to that seen in individuals 18 years of age and older. This data, combined with the available safety data, led us to conclude that the benefits of a booster dose outweigh the risks for this age group.\"\n\nHowever, the FDA is aware of reports of myocarditis and pericarditis following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination, particularly in males under 30 years of age. The agency assessed the risks and benefits of a booster dose for 16- and 17-year-olds and determined that the benefits of a booster dose outweigh the risks of myocarditis and pericarditis in this age group.\n\nPfizer is currently conducting studies on the risks of myocarditis and pericarditis following the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, and the FDA and CDC will continue to monitor safety data closely.\n\nThe FDA did not convene the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee for the decision to expand booster eligibility to 16- and 17-year-olds, as the committee was not needed for this action given the available data. The FDA will continue to work closely with its partners at the CDC to communicate the latest information about COVID-19 vaccines to the public."}

Campus safety is once again a major concern for parents, students, and educators as they grapple with the reality of school violence.\n\nIn a disturbing turn of events, a student at a school in Orange County was arrested for making an apparent threat on social media. According to Seal Beach Police Chief Phil Gonshak, \"The threat was made on a social media platform, and it was reported to our department. We took it seriously and acted swiftly to ensure the safety of the students and staff at the school involved.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in Michigan, a 15-year-old student at Oxford High School, Ethan Crumbley, faces terrorism and murder charges for the deadly shooting. The tragic incident has raised serious questions about how the warning signs were missed and why the student was not removed from school the day of the shooting.\n\nCrumbley's parents, James and Jennifer Crumbley, have also been charged with involuntary manslaughter. According to a press release from the Oakland County Sheriff's Office, \"The Crumbleys had been contacted by the school multiple times prior to the shooting for Ethan's disruptive behavior in class.\"\n\nTim Throne, Superintendent of Oxford Community Schools, issued a statement expressing his condolences and announcing a third-party investigation into the events leading up to the shooting. Throne stated, \"We will leave no stone unturned to understand what happened and why. Our priority is and always will be the safety and well-being of our students.\"\n\nAt McGaugh Elementary School in Los Alamitos, Principal Dr. Issaic Gates and his team are reviewing and discussing safety protocols with staff and students. Gates emphasized the importance of maintaining open lines of communication, stating, \"We encourage our students and families to report any concerns they may have, no matter how small they may seem.\"\n\nLos Alamitos Unified School District has a comprehensive school safety plan in place, which includes a Threat Assessment Team.

Dr. Gates added, \"We take every threat seriously and work closely with law enforcement to ensure the safety of our students and staff.\"\n\nAccording to police reports, Crumbley had been exhibiting troubling behavior in the days leading up to the shooting. He reportedly drew disturbing drawings, including one depicting a handgun with the words \"My thoughts are exacto.\"\n\nDespite these concerning signs, Crumbley was not removed from school the day of the shooting. Throne stated in a press conference, \"We had no indication that this student was planning to harm himself or others.\"\n\nThe shooting at Oxford High School has prompted a renewed focus on school safety in Orange County and beyond. Parents and educators are working together to ensure that their schools have the resources and protocols in place to keep students safe.\n\nAccording to the National Center for Education Statistics, there were over 150 school shootings in the United States between 2000 and 2019. The tragedies at Oxford High School and other schools across the country underscore the need for continued vigilance and action to prevent school violence.\n\nAs the investigation into the Oxford High School shooting continues, the community remains committed to ensuring the safety of all students and staff on school campuses. Throne stated, \"We will do everything in our power to learn from this tragedy and make sure it never happens again.\"\n\nThe events at Oxford High School serve as a stark reminder that school safety is an ongoing concern that requires the collective efforts of parents, educators, and law enforcement. By working together and staying vigilant, we can help prevent future tragedies and ensure that our schools remain safe havens for learning and growth.\n\nQuote from Tim Throne (Superintendent, Oxford Community Schools): \"We will leave no stone unturned to understand what happened and why.

Hancock stated, \"There were communications via email between Mr. Baldwin and Ms. Gutierrez-Reed regarding the choice of weapon.\"\n\nAn affidavit filed by Detective Hancock also revealed that Baldwin had asked for a specific gun for rehearsals but was given a different one during the actual filming. This revelation came to light as part of the investigation into the October 2021 incident.\n\nAs part of the ongoing investigation, a search warrant was issued to acquire Baldwin's cell phone for a forensic download to acquire all contacts, text messages, social media accounts, data, and GPS data from the device. The search warrant was sought after Baldwin's cooperation in providing the phone was contingent on a warrant being issued.\n\nAaron Dyer, Baldwin's civil attorney, confirmed his client's cooperation with the authorities and emphasized the need to protect personal information on Baldwin's phone. Dyer stated, \"Mr. Baldwin, as we have from the beginning, intends to fully cooperate with the ongoing investigation into the tragic accident that occurred on the 'Rust' film set.\"\n\nBaldwin, in an ABC News interview, insisted he did not pull the trigger. Instead, he claimed the gun fired when he released the hammer. Lisa Torraco, attorney for Rust assistant director Dave Halls, also supported Baldwin's claim, stating, \"Mr. Halls did not pull the trigger of the gun or provide it to Mr. Baldwin.\"\n\nThe investigation into the shooting continues, with Detective Hancock expressing her belief that Baldwin's phone may contain evidence of the commission of a crime. The detective stated in the affidavit, \"Based on my training and experience, I believe that there may be evidence on Mr. Baldwin's phone related to this investigation.\"\n\nThe discussions about the choice of gun and accessories for the production were conducted through email between Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed. The affidavit filed by Detective Hancock also revealed that Baldwin had requested a 'cold gun' for rehearsals, a term used in the industry to refer to a gun that is not loaded with live ammunition.\n\nAccording to the affidavit, Gutierrez-Reed responded to Baldwin's email, stating, \"The gun was checked and the rounds were good to go.\" This email exchange has become a critical piece of evidence in the ongoing investigation.\n\nDespite Baldwin's insistence that he did not pull the trigger, the incident has left many questions unanswered. The investigation continues to focus on the handling and safety procedures of the firearms on the set.\n\nThe fatal shooting on the \"Rust\" set has brought renewed attention to the issue of gun safety in the film industry. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of strict adherence to safety protocols and the potential consequences of negligence.\n\nAs the investigation into the fatal shooting on the \"Rust\" movie set continues, new details continue to emerge. The role of communication between Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed in the events leading up to the incident remains a key focus of the investigation.

Amidst the legal and insurance disputes, the principle of general average is emerging as a significant point of contention.\n\nGeneral average is an equitable sharing of loss between vessel owners and cargo interests, as outlined in the York Antwerp Rules. According to Joe Klobus, Claims and Insurance Manager at OEC Group, \"General average is a long-standing maritime tradition that ensures fairness in the distribution of losses between the shipowner and cargo interests.\"\n\nThe principle of general average can be invoked for reasons beyond vessel fires or overboard containers. These reasons may include salvage operations, seeking refuge, or other extraordinary circumstances. In the case of the Ever Given, it was the vessel's owners, not Evergreen, who invoked general average.\n\nThe increasing frequency of incidents such as containers falling overboard has made general average declarations more common. Klobus adds, \"The maritime industry has seen an increased number of general average declarations in recent years due to various unforeseen circumstances.\"\n\nWhile Evergreen is not technically liable for invoking general average, the company faces a public and legal challenge regarding the financial implications of the Suez Canal blockade. The Egyptian authorities have estimated the total losses at approximately $900 million, with $300 million each for a salvage bonus and loss of reputation.\n\nVessels delayed due to the Ever Given's grounding likely cannot declare general average as delay doesn't fit within the York Antwerp Rules. Klobus explains, \"General average declarations are typically made when there is a direct threat to the vessel or cargo, not due to delay caused by external factors.\"\n\nGeneral average is a complex legal concept that can be difficult for many shippers to fully understand. Joe Klobus advises, \"Shippers entering contracts should be aware of general average and consult with their insurance providers or legal counsel to fully understand its implications.\"\n\nConsumer prices could be affected as charges levied against the Ever Given and other ships could be rolled into landed costs, potentially impacting the market. Klobus warns, \"The financial consequences of general average declarations can ripple through the entire supply chain, ultimately affecting consumer prices.\"\n\nThe maritime industry has a long history of invoking general average, dating back to the 18th century. It was first codified in the York Antwerp Rules in 1994 and has since become an essential part of maritime law.\n\nThe Ever Given's grounding in the Suez Canal disrupted global shipping for six days, causing a logjam of over 400 vessels waiting to pass through the canal. The economic impact of the blockade was felt far and wide, with billions of dollars in potential losses.\n\nThe salvage operation to refloat the Ever Given was a massive undertaking, involving a multinational team of engineers and experts. The salvage bonus, estimated at $300 million, was a significant incentive for the salvage crew to successfully free the vessel.\n\nThe legal and financial complexities of the Ever Given incident extend beyond general average. Insurance claims, contract disputes, and potential liability for damages are just a few of the many issues at play.\n\nAs the shipping industry continues to grapple with the aftermath of the Ever Given incident, it is clear that the principle of general average will remain a crucial aspect of maritime law. Understanding its implications is essential for shippers, insurers, and other stakeholders in the global supply chain.\n\nThe Suez Canal crisis serves as a reminder of the complex and interconnected nature of the global shipping industry. The invocation of general average in response to the Ever Given's grounding highlights the need for continued collaboration and communication between all parties involved to mitigate potential losses and ensure the smooth flow of international trade."}

Brady's electrifying performance led his team to a triumphant 31-9 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nDuring the post-game trophy presentation, a subtle yet intriguing moment caught the attention of the sports world: Brady seemed to be concealing the Nike logo on his undershirt. This unexpected move ignited speculations and debates among fans and media, potentially due to his endorsement deal with Under Armour.\n\nBrady's football attire consists of Under Armour cleats and a glove, yet the NFL's apparel contract mandates Nike logos on team uniforms and gear. This contractual obligation creates an intriguing tension between individual athlete sponsorships and team or league deals with apparel brands.\n\nThe act of hiding the Nike logo may have been an attempt by Brady to avoid promoting the brand, given his association with Under Armour, a leading competitor in the athletic apparel industry. This clandestine move was reminiscent of Michael Jordan's famous cover-up of the Reebok logo during the 1992 Olympics.\n\nHowever, Brady's logo concealment was not as meticulously executed as Jordan's. While Jordan's effort was a well-planned and effective strategy, Brady's attempt was evident in some photos and videos taken during the trophy presentation.\n\nJordan's logo cover-up during the 1992 Olympics was an iconic moment in sports marketing history. As the face of Nike's \"Just Do It\" campaign, Jordan wore a pair of shorts with the Nike logo intentionally removed for the gold medal ceremony.\n\nBrady's attempt to cover the Nike logo during the Super Bowl LV trophy presentation brought back memories of Jordan's 1992 Olympics moment. Yet, the execution was not as flawless, leaving some spectators questioning Brady's intentions.\n\nDespite Brady's logo cover-up, it's important to note that the night was a significant success for the legendary quarterback. Brady led his team to victory, etching his name further into football history.\n\nThe tension between individual athlete sponsorships and team or league deals with apparel brands is not a new issue. Athletes often face the challenge of balancing their personal endorsements with the obligations of their teams and leagues.\n\nBrady's move to cover the Nike logo may not have been purely about brand loyalty; it could have been a simple gesture for comfort. The tight-fitting Nike undershirt may have irritated Brady, prompting him to cover the logo for his own comfort during the presentation.\n\nRegardless of Brady's intentions, the logo cover-up adds another layer of intrigue to an already captivating sports moment. The incident underscores the complex relationship between athletes, teams, leagues, and apparel brands.\n\nBrady's cover-up is a reminder that athletes' endorsement deals go beyond their on-field performance. Their image and brand are valuable commodities in the multi-billion-dollar sports industry.\n\nThe football world has witnessed numerous logo cover-ups and endorsement controversies throughout history. These incidents serve as a testament to the power and influence of sports marketing.\n\nBrady's logo concealment during the Super Bowl LV trophy presentation has sparked a lively debate among sports fans and industry experts. While some view it as a strategic marketing move, others see it as a simple comfort gesture.\n\nRegardless of the intentions behind Brady's logo cover-up, it highlights the importance of understanding the complex dynamics of sports marketing and sponsorships. The relationship between athletes, teams, leagues, and apparel brands continues to evolve, shaping the future of sports marketing.\n\nAs Brady continues to make history on the football field, the logo cover-up incident serves as a reminder of the intricacies of sports marketing and the ever-evolving relationship between athletes, teams, leagues, and apparel brands.

The attack resulted in over 100GB of data being stolen, according to reports.\n\nKnown for its double-extortion tactic, DarkSide typically steals data before encrypting it and threatens to release the information publicly if the ransom demand is not met. However, the group might have opted to avoid this tactic in the Colonial Pipeline case due to potential \"social\" problems, such as negative publicity and backlash.\n\nAs of May 11, the stolen Colonial Pipeline data has not appeared on DarkSide's leak site, leaving many wondering about the group's intentions. The lack of publication could be due to various reasons, such as negotiations with Colonial Pipeline or internal discussions within the group.\n\nAccording to a report by Bloomberg on May 13, Colonial Pipeline paid close to $5 million in ransom for a decryption key to regain access to its systems. This figure underscores the financial impact of ransomware attacks on businesses, particularly those in critical infrastructure sectors.\n\nThe Colonial Pipeline attack is among the largest cyberattacks on critical US infrastructure, highlighting systemic vulnerabilities that put the nation's essential services at risk.

The investigation into Petito's disappearance revealed that Laundrie returned to his home in North Port, Florida, on Sept. 1.\n\nPetito's family reported her missing on Sept. 11, and Laundrie has not cooperated with authorities. The search for Petito led investigators to Grand Teton National Park, where her body was found on Sept. 19.\n\nOn Aug. 12, a domestic violence incident involving Petito and Laundrie was reported in Utah, captured on bodycam footage, with no charges filed. In an interview with the Moab City Police Department, Laundrie admitted to the incident, stating, \"I did push her. I grabbed her face, like this, and pushed her away. I didn't hit her, slap her, push her into anything. I didn't cause the injury to her face.\"\n\nIn a statement, the North Port Police Department confirmed that Laundrie is a person of interest in Petito's case. \"The North Port Police Department is actively investigating this matter in conjunction with other local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies,\" the statement read. \"Our primary focus is locating Brian Laundrie and understanding the facts surrounding Gabby Petito's disappearance.\"\n\nBaker's encounter with Laundrie raises new questions in the investigation into Petito's disappearance and presumed death. \"I just want to help in any way I can,\" Baker said. \"If my encounter with Brian Laundrie can provide any information to help find answers for Gabby's family, I want to do that.\"\n\nAs the investigation into Petito's disappearance and Laundrie's involvement continues, law enforcement agencies are urging anyone with information to come forward. If you have any information related to this case, please contact the North Port Police Department at (941) 429-7382 or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-423-TIPS (8477).

Lane Luper, the film's formerly first camera assistant, resigned from his position days before the fatal incident due to safety issues, including lax COVID-19 policies, poor housing conditions, and gun safety concerns.\n\nIn his resignation letter, obtained by ABC News, Luper wrote, \"It is with a heavy heart that I resign from my position as 1st Camera Assistant on Rust due to safety concerns. The production has made it clear that they do not value the wellbeing of their workers, and I cannot in good conscience continue to work under these conditions.\"\n\nSanta Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza, who is leading the investigation into the shooting, shed light on the chaos that ensued when Hutchins was killed. \"There was a chaotic scene,\" Mendoza told ABC News. \"Everyone was trying to figure out what had happened. It was a very hectic scene.\"\n\nThe shooting has since halted production on the film, which was being made at Bonanza Creek Ranch in Santa Fe, New Mexico. In a statement, Rust Movie Productions LLC denied Luper's claims about ignoring safety concerns and budget issues, stating, \"The safety of our cast and crew is the top priority of Rust Productions and everyone associated with the company. We will continue to cooperate fully with all authorities and investigations.\"\n\nHowever, the Santa Fe District Attorney, Mary Carmack-Altwies, has not ruled out charges against anyone involved in the incident. \"We're still investigating,\" Carmack-Altwies told ABC News. \"We're going to follow the facts and the law where they lead us.\"\n\nInvestigators believe a real bullet was loaded in the firearm Baldwin used, and they have recovered three guns and about 500 rounds of ammunition, including live rounds, from the set. Assistant director David Halls, who declared the gun 'cold' before handing it to Baldwin, claimed ignorance of live rounds in the weapon. \"I didn't know live rounds were being used,\" Halls told investigators, according to a law enforcement source.\n\nThe film's armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, is under scrutiny but denies knowing the source of live rounds. \"I had no reason to believe there were live rounds on set,\" Gutierrez-Reed told ABC News in a statement. \"I would never compromise the safety and well-being of the cast and crew by bringing live ammunition to set.\"\n\nLuper, who spoke to ABC News on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation, expressed his relief at no longer being a part of the production. \"I'm just glad I wasn't there when it happened,\" he said. \"I can't imagine what the victims' families are going through. It's a tragedy that could have been prevented.\"\n\nAs the investigation into the shooting continues, the film industry is once again confronted with the issue of safety on set, and the question of who will be held accountable for the fatal incident.\n\n\"Our focus right now is on the investigation and ensuring that justice is served for Halyna and Joel,\" Carmack-Altwies said. \"But we also need to take a hard look at the working conditions in our industry and make sure that this never happens again.\"\n\nMendoza echoed Carmack-Altwies' sentiments. \"This is a wake-up call for the industry,\" Mendoza said. \"We need to make sure that everyone goes home safe at the end of the day.\"\n\nIn the meantime, the cast and crew of \"Rust\" are left to grapple with the aftermath of the tragic incident. \"It's a sad day for all of us,\" Luper said. \"We were making a movie, and now we're dealing with something much bigger than that. It's a reminder that safety should always be our top priority.\""}

Born on June 4, 2021, in Santa Barbara, California, Lilibet weighed 7 pounds, 11 ounces at birth. Both Harry and Meghan are reportedly healthy and well.\n\nThe name Lilibet is a poignant tribute to Queen Elizabeth II, whose childhood nickname was 'Lilibet,' and Harry's late mother, Princess Diana. The couple's firstborn son, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, was named after Harry's father, Prince Charles, and his grandfather, King George VI.\n\nIn a statement shared on their Archewell Foundation website, Harry and Meghan requested that, in lieu of gifts, well-wishers support charities dedicated to improving the lives of women and girls, including Girls' Opportunity Alliance, CAMFED, and Myna Mahila Foundation.\n\nThe Sussexes will take parental leave from their work at the Archewell Foundation to spend time with their new addition. Harry has previously spoken about the importance of taking time off to be with his family, stating, \"Being a dad to Archie is the best job I've ever had, and I wish my own father could have been there for me.\"\n\nLilibet is expected to be Harry and Meghan's last child, with the couple citing environmental concerns as their reason for stopping at two. In a 2019 interview with ITV, Meghan stated, \"We're both very aware of our place in history as the Monarchy is constantly evolving, and we're very respectful of that.\"\n\nLilibet is the Sussexes' second child and eighth in line to the British throne. Archie, who turns three this year, is currently seventh in line. The arrival of Lilibet comes after Meghan shared her experience of suffering a miscarriage in November 2020 in a New York Times op-ed.\n\nHarry and Meghan's decision to step down as working members of the royal family in early 2020 and their subsequent high-profile interview with Oprah Winfrey in March 2021 have cast a shadow over Lilibet's birth. However, the couple has remained focused on their family and their philanthropic efforts.\n\nArchie and Lilibet are the only biracial members of the British royal family, and their presence has sparked conversations about diversity and inclusion within the monarchy. Meghan's experiences as a biracial woman and a member of the royal family have been the subject of much media attention and debate.\n\nAs Harry and Meghan navigate their new roles as parents of two, they continue to use their platform to raise awareness for various causes, including mental health, climate change, and racial equality. Their daughter Lilibet's arrival marks a new chapter in their lives and the evolution of the British monarchy."}

(AP) – A judge in Wisconsin has ordered Kyle Rittenhouse, the 18-year-old charged with fatally shooting two men during last year's protests over the police shooting of Jacob Blake, to avoid associating with known white supremacist groups. Rittenhouse, who was 17 at the time of the shootings, is currently out on bail and faces charges including reckless and intentional homicide, endangerment, and being a minor in possession of a firearm.\n\nProsecutors allege that Rittenhouse traveled from his home in Antioch, Illinois, to Kenosha, Wisconsin, to join militia groups and protect businesses during the protests. Rittenhouse has pleaded not guilty, asserting that he acted in self-defense.\n\nHowever, the modifications to Rittenhouse's bail conditions came after he was seen drinking in a bar and posing for a photo making a symbol used by white supremacist groups. The judge's order explicitly prohibits Rittenhouse from associating with groups known to harass others based on race, religion, color, national origin, or gender. He is also barred from possessing firearms and consuming alcohol.\n\nThe bail condition modifications were requested by the Kenosha County District Attorney's Office, which argued that Rittenhouse's actions at the bar posed a danger to the community and undermined the trust placed in him by allowing him to be released on bail.\n\nRittenhouse's case has drawn significant attention, with conservatives rallying to support him. Some have portrayed him as a patriot who was defending private property against violent protesters. Others have criticized the criminal justice system for charging him at all, arguing that he acted in self-defense.\n\nThe shooting deaths of Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber during the protests on Aug. 25, 2020, were captured on video and sparked widespread protests and debate over the use of force by law enforcement and the role of armed civilians in public unrest.\n\nThe trial in Rittenhouse's case is scheduled to begin on Nov. 1, 2021. If convicted, he could face decades in prison.\n\nThe judge's order to avoid white supremacist groups comes as the country grapples with a resurgence of white supremacist violence and hate crimes. The Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights organization that monitors hate groups, reported a record-breaking number of hate groups in the United States in 2020.\n\nRittenhouse's case is just the latest in a series of high-profile cases involving the use of force by law enforcement against Black Americans and the role of armed civilians in protests. The shooting deaths of Blake, George Floyd, and Breonna Taylor, among others, have sparked widespread protests and calls for police reform and racial justice.\n\nThe judge's order to avoid white supremacist groups is an attempt to prevent Rittenhouse from becoming a symbol for hate groups and to ensure that the trial focuses on the facts of the case and the law, rather than being overshadowed by larger political and social issues. However, it remains to be seen whether the order will be effective in achieving that goal."}

Colin Powell's Unyielding Courage: A Vietnam War Hero's Selfless Acts\n\nIn the annals of American military history, the name Colin Powell stands out as a beacon of resilience, leadership, and unwavering dedication. This esteemed four-star general, who later served as the Secretary of State under President George W. Bush, first made a name for himself during the Vietnam War. In 1968, then-Maj. Powell was on his second tour in Vietnam, assigned to the Army's 23rd Infantry Division.\n\nPowell, who had already demonstrated resilience and commitment, had been previously wounded in 1963 by a Viet Cong (VC) booby trap. Yet, he returned to the battlefield, determined to serve his country and protect his comrades.\n\nOn Nov. 16, 1968, the helicopter carrying Powell and others crashed in the dense jungle of Vietnam. As the chopper went down, Powell and his fellow passengers braced for impact, unsure of what lay ahead.\n\nDespite being injured in the crash, Powell's instincts took over. Disregarding his own safety, he ran back to the burning wreckage multiple times to rescue his fellow passengers.\n\nAs the flames consumed the helicopter, Powell tore away burning metal with his bare hands to free a trapped passenger. His selfless actions that day would go down in military history, earning him the Soldier's Medal for heroism.\n\nThe Soldier's Medal, established in 1926, is the United States military's highest decoration for acts of heroism not involving conflict with an enemy. Powell's actions during the helicopter crash exemplified the award's purpose.\n\nOver the course of his deployments to Vietnam, Powell was also honored with a Bronze Star and two Purple Hearts for his valor and injuries sustained in combat.\n\nPowell's incredible bravery and dedication under extreme conditions were a testament to his unwavering commitment to his comrades and his country. His story is a reminder of the sacrifices made by military personnel during wartime.\n\nDuring an interview with the Academy of Achievement in 1998, Powell shared his account of the helicopter crash and the events that followed. The interview provided insight into the mind of a man who, despite the odds, continued to serve his country with unyielding courage.\n\nThe story of Powell's heroism did not go unnoticed. We Are The Mighty (WATM), a platform celebrating military life and service, recently shared his tale with the public.\n\nThrough the years, Powell's legacy has continued to inspire generations of military personnel and civilians alike. His story serves as a testament to the human spirit's ability to persevere in the face of adversity.\n\nAs we remember the sacrifices made by our military personnel during times of war, the story of Maj. Colin Powell's unyielding courage stands as a shining example of selflessness, commitment, and resilience. His actions that day in Vietnam continue to inspire and remind us of the incredible feats that can be achieved when one chooses to put the needs of others before their own."}

The program, hosted by Chris Cuomo, has been a staple in the cable news landscape, but recent scandals involving his brother, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, appear to be taking a toll on its viewership.\n\nCompared to the week of Jan. 25, when the show drew an average of 2.2 million viewers, Chris Cuomo's program saw a staggering 45% decline in viewership. This marks a significant loss for the network, as \"Cuomo Prime Time\" was once a top-performing show in the primetime lineup.\n\nThe timing of this viewership drop coincides with a series of scandals surrounding Chris Cuomo's brother. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has been accused of sexual harassment by multiple women and is under investigation for allegedly covering up nursing home COVID-19 deaths.\n\nAdding to the controversy, it was reported that Chris Cuomo received prioritized coronavirus testing from his brother's administration during the early stages of the pandemic. This revelation raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest and favoritism.\n\nPreviously, CNN faced criticism for allowing Chris Cuomo to interview his brother in a series that was widely criticized for lacking seriousness. The interviews, which took place in September 2020, were seen as an attempt to bolster Gov. Cuomo's image amidst growing controversy.\n\nFollowing the scandals, CNN announced that Chris Cuomo would no longer cover his brother on the show. However, the damage had already been done, as viewers began to question the impartiality of the program.\n\nThe viewership decline was not limited to total viewers; \"Cuomo Prime Time\" also saw a 55% decline in viewership among adults age 25-54, a key demographic for advertisers.\n\nMeanwhile, Fox News' \"Gutfeld!\" – a late-night talk show hosted by Greg Gutfeld – outperformed every CNN program since its premiere on April 5. The show drew an average of 2.4 million viewers during the same period.\n\nFurthermore, \"Gutfeld!\" surpassed several broadcast network late-night shows in viewership, including NBC's \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\" and ABC's \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\"\n\nIt is important to note that viewership numbers can fluctuate for various reasons, and one week does not necessarily indicate a long-term trend. However, the significant drop in viewership for \"Cuomo Prime Time\" is a concerning development for CNN.\n\nThe network has yet to comment on the impact of the scandals on Chris Cuomo's show. It remains to be seen how the situation will unfold and whether the viewership decline is a temporary setback or a more permanent shift in the cable news landscape.\n\nAs the story continues to unfold, it is clear that the relationship between Chris Cuomo and his brother, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, has had far-reaching consequences for both their personal and professional lives. The future of \"Cuomo Prime Time\" and Chris Cuomo's career at CNN remain uncertain as the investigations into the scandals continue."}

However, the actions of public figures continue to contradict these lessons, leaving young minds confused and disillusioned.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin (D) have been working tirelessly to pass the Freedom to Vote Act, a crucial piece of legislation aimed at protecting the sacred right to vote. Yet, their efforts have been repeatedly thwarted by Republicans, led by Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), who continues to play a ruthless power game, indifferent to the damage it inflicts on our democratic institutions and the example it sets for future generations.\n\nSchumer lamented, \"The Freedom to Vote Act is not a partisan issue. It's about protecting the foundations of our democracy.\" Manchin echoed this sentiment, adding, \"We cannot allow our political differences to jeopardize the very fundamentals of our country.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in Texas, the Republican-led legislature is gerrymandering districts and passing laws that discriminate against minorities and restrict women's rights to abortion. Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (TX) denounced these actions, stating, \"Texas Republicans continue to perpetuate a dangerous and divisive agenda that undermines the progress we've made as a nation.\"\n\nThe attack on critical race theory in education and the promotion of a biased view of history further confuses children, as they grapple with complex issues that demand nuanced understanding.

Roy Cooper condemned these remarks, emphasizing, \"Our state should be a place where everyone is treated with dignity and respect.\"\n\nTragically, Colin Powell's passing was used as an opportunity by some to push anti-vaccine narratives, despite the complicating factors surrounding his death. McConnell, who had previously praised Powell's service to our country, remained conspicuously silent in the face of such rhetoric. Powell's former Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, expressed her disappointment, stating, \"It is disheartening to see some use Colin Powell's passing as a platform to spread misinformation and endanger public health.\"\n\nThe hypocrisy of these actions is not lost on our children.

Fans were eager to witness history in the making.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, Brady was introduced to the Tampa Bay community via a video conference call. Thousands of fans tuned in to welcome their new hero.\n\nIn preparation for the upcoming season, the Buccaneers unveiled new uniform combinations inspired by their 2002 Super Bowl win.

In a recent interview on the podcast \"You Are Here,\" hosted by BlazeTV, Rittenhouse discussed the events of August 25, 2020, and his feelings since being cleared of wrongdoing.\n\n\"In hindsight, I might not have done that,\" Rittenhouse admitted during the podcast, referring to his journey to Kenosha to help protect local businesses amid unrest. He emphasized that he did not go looking for trouble but wanted to help his community.\n\nDespite his regrets, Rittenhouse maintained that he acted in self-defense during the encounters that led to the deaths of two men and the wounding of another. \"I was trying to get out of there as fast as I could,\" he stated, recalling the chaos of the night. \"I didn't want to be there.\"\n\nRittenhouse's defense team argued that the shootings were justified, as he aimed to provide medical care and protect businesses from destruction. Prosecutors, however, contended that Rittenhouse had escalated the situation by arming himself with an AR-15 style weapon.\n\nDuring the interview, co-host Sydney Watson made controversial remarks about the shootings, which Rittenhouse did not celebrate. \"You are not a killer,\" Watson told him. \"You're not a murderer.\" Rittenhouse clarified that he didn't see himself as a hero, only someone who had defended himself.\n\nThe families of the victims, Anthony Huber and Joseph Rosenbaum, have expressed their dismay at the verdict, feeling that there is a lack of accountability for Rittenhouse's actions. \"He took the life of my son,\" Huber's mother, Karen Bloom-Huber, said in a statement. \"No amount of spin can change that fact.\"\n\nRittenhouse acknowledged the emotional toll the trial and aftermath have taken on him. \"I've been diagnosed with PTSD,\" he revealed on the podcast. \"I try to cope with it through humor. There's a lot of trial memes out there.\"\n\nWhen asked about his future plans, Rittenhouse stated, \"I just want to move on with my life. I want to go back to normal.\" The 18-year-old hopes to focus on his education and rebuild his life while dealing with the ongoing fallout from the events in Kenosha."}

The most notable of these incidents took place on the set of \"The Crow\" in 1993, where actor Brandon Lee was accidentally shot and killed. Fast forward to 2021, and another fatal shooting on the set of \"Rust\" has brought renewed attention to this issue.\n\nBoth the 1993 and 2021 shootings involved real, functional guns that were supposed to be safe but weren't properly checked. Jerry Spivey, the former district attorney for Wilmington, North Carolina, who chose not to file criminal charges after Brandon Lee's death, shared, \"There was a lack of evidence for criminal intent.\"\n\nBrandon Lee died on the set of \"The Crow\" due to a fragment of a lead bullet lodged in a gun barrel. Halyna Hutchins, the cinematographer on \"Rust,\" was killed when actor Alec Baldwin discharged a prop gun, shooting her with a real bullet.\n\nAfter Lee's death, Spivey decided against filing criminal charges, stating, \"There was no evidence of a crime, and there was no evidence of criminal intent.\" James Janowitz, a New York lawyer who represented \"The Crow\" producers at the time, added, \"There was no question that it was an accident.\"\n\nMichael Massee, the actor who fired the weapon on \"The Crow,\" shared his feelings about the incident, \"It was a terrible tragedy, and it weighed heavily on me for a long time.\"\n\nThe Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office is currently investigating the \"Rust\" shooting, and no criminal charges have been filed yet. Adan Mendoza, the Santa Fe County Sheriff, said, \"Our investigation is ongoing. We're considering all options.\"\n\nNew Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham has called for state legislation regarding safety protocols on film sets. She stated, \"We need to take a hard look at what happened and make sure it never happens again.\"\n\nBrandon Lee's death led to a lawsuit by his family against the producers of \"The Crow.\" Linda Lee Cadwell, Brandon Lee's mother, and Eliza Hutton, his fiancé, sued for wrongful death. The case was settled for an undisclosed amount.\n\nDespite the tragedy, the producers and Lee's family agreed that releasing the film was best to honor his performance. Janowitz shared, \"Brandon was passionate about 'The Crow.' We felt it was important to complete the project.\"\n\nThe incidents have intensified calls for reform in the use of real guns on movie sets. District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies commented, \"We need stricter regulations and enforcement to ensure the safety of everyone on set.\"\n\nThe use of real guns on movie sets is a complex issue. Massee explained, \"It's a balance between realism and safety. But after what happened to Brandon and Halyna, it's clear that we need to do better.\"\n\nSafety measures and protocol compliance on movie sets have long been a concern. Spivey recalled, \"When I investigated Brandon's death, I was shocked by the lack of oversight and regulation.\"\n\nThe \"Rust\" shooting incident has brought renewed attention to this issue. Mendoza emphasized, \"We need to make sure that everyone on set, from the actors to the crew, understands the importance of following safety protocols.\"\n\nCarmack-Altwies believes that stricter regulations are necessary. She stated, \"We need to ensure that there are consequences for not following safety protocols. Lives are at stake.\"\n\nThe film industry is working to address these concerns. The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) has proposed new guidelines for the use of firearms on sets. IATSE President Matthew D. Loeb stated, \"Safety is our number one priority.\"\n\nLee's death and the \"Rust\" incident serve as grim reminders of the risks involved in the film industry. Cadwell shared, \"Brandon's death was a tragedy that could have been prevented. We need to make sure that no one else has to go through what we did.\"\n\nHutchins' death has shaken the film community, and many are calling for change. Massee concluded, \"It's time for the industry to take a hard look at itself and make the necessary improvements to ensure the safety of everyone involved.\"\n\nAs the investigations into the \"Rust\" shooting continue, it remains to be seen what changes will be made to the film industry's safety protocols. One thing is clear, however: the tragic deaths of Brandon Lee and Halyna Hutchins have left an indelible mark on the industry and serve as a reminder of the importance of prioritizing safety on set."}

The hurricane led to an unprecedented shut-in of offshore crude oil and natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico. According to the U.S. Department of Interior's Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, approximately 96% of crude oil production and 94% of natural gas production were halted due to the storm. In addition, at least nine refineries shut down or reduced production in response to the hurricane.\n\nThe impact of Hurricane Ida on the Gulf of Mexico energy sector was significant. The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement reported that 1.5 million barrels per day (b/d) of crude oil production was shut in. Nine refineries, responsible for a combined 1.7 million b/d of refinery runs, either shut down or reduced production. The September Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO) from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasted a reduction in crude oil production and refinery runs as a result of the hurricane.\n\nThe ripple effects of the hurricane were felt beyond the Gulf of Mexico. According to the EIA, gross inputs into Gulf Coast refineries fell by 1.6 million b/d following Hurricane Ida. Crude oil inventories in the Gulf Coast dropped by 2.6 million barrels, while U.S. crude oil production decreased by 1.5 million b/d from August 27 to September 3. The disruptions caused by Hurricane Ida are expected to be short-lived, with Gulf of Mexico crude oil production anticipated to return to previously forecast levels in October.\n\nAnother storm, Hurricane Nicholas, made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane near Houston on September 14. The storm caused temporary disruptions to Colonial Pipeline operations, which transports approximately 100,000 b/d of refined products from the Gulf Coast to the East Coast. Trade press reports indicate that Colonial Pipeline has resumed normal operations, and the Houston Ship Channel is expected to reopen soon.\n\nThe dual impacts of Hurricane Ida and Nicholas serve as a reminder of the vulnerability of the U.S. energy sector to extreme weather events. The disruptions caused by these storms underscore the importance of robust contingency plans and resilient infrastructure to minimize the impacts of such events on energy production and distribution. The EIA will continue to monitor the situation closely and provide updates as new information becomes available."}

The revised EBITDA range is now $1,475 million to $1,875 million, and free cash flow is expected to be between $200 million and $600 million.\n\nBefore the storm, Vistra estimated significantly higher EBITDA and free cash flow for 2021.\n\nChief Executive Curt Morgan said the company generated more power than its market share during the storm. \"Our power plants performed exceptionally well during the extreme weather conditions,\" Morgan said in a statement. \"Absent the gas deliverability and cost issues, Winter Storm Uri would have had a slightly positive impact on our 2021 EBITDA.\"\n\nVistra's gas supply contracts did not cover the extreme cold temperatures experienced during the storm, resulting in significant gas cost increases. In addition, the company had to purchase power on the wholesale market at record prices to meet customer demand.\n\nMorgan also announced that Vistra will not buy additional shares in 2021 but will maintain its quarterly dividend. \"Despite the challenges presented by Winter Storm Uri, our financial position remains strong,\" he said.\n\nVistra's revised earnings guidance follows similar moves by other utilities and energy companies, including NextEra Energy (NEE) and CenterPoint Energy (CNP), which also faced significant costs from the storm.\n\nInvestors reacted positively to the news, with Vistra's stock price up 3% in early trading on Monday.\n\nMorgan expressed optimism about the company's long-term prospects. \"We remain committed to executing our growth strategy and delivering value for our shareholders,\" he said.\n\nThe winter storm caused widespread power outages and record electricity prices across the southern United States, with Texas being the hardest hit.

The comment came during a segment where they discussed the '70s sitcom \"Good Times,\" which features an African American family.\n\nWhile Lemon laughed at the comment, many on Twitter found it inappropriate and equated it to cultural appropriation. The comment came at a time when racial sensitivity and awareness are at the forefront of public discourse.\n\nOne of the most vocal critics was journalist Aisha Staggers, who took to Twitter to express her displeasure. She highlighted the reality of racism that black people face and the insensitivity of Cuomo's remark.\n\nThe backlash against Cuomo did not stop there. Some Twitter users compared him to his brother, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who is facing allegations of sexual harassment.\n\nCriticism ranged from calls for CNN to provide sensitivity training to their on-air personalities to outright condemnation of Chris Cuomo's words. The incident sparked a wider conversation about cultural sensitivity and the implications of racial remarks.\n\nHowever, not all social media users found the exchange between Cuomo and Lemon to be offensive. A few found it hilarious, with one user tweeting, \"If you can't laugh at yourself, you're missing out.\"\n\nDespite the criticism, Chris Cuomo has a reputation for being \"spoilt\" and \"entitled,\" with some attributing his television career to his family name. His father was former New York Governor Mario Cuomo, and his brother is the current governor.\n\nCuomo's comment also comes at a time when CNN is under scrutiny for its handling of sexual misconduct allegations against several of its anchors, including Chris' brother.\n\nThe incident highlights the importance of cultural sensitivity in the media and the potential consequences of insensitive remarks. In a statement, a CNN spokesperson said, \"Chris did not intend to offend anyone and apologizes if he did.\"\n\nAisha Staggers was not satisfied with the apology and continued to criticize Cuomo, tweeting, \"An apology without an understanding of the impact of your words is empty.\"\n\nThe backlash against Cuomo also raised questions about the role of media personalities in shaping public discourse and the responsibility they have to be culturally sensitive.\n\nSome social media users pointed out the irony of Cuomo's comment, given the history of racism and discrimination against African Americans in the United States.\n\nOthers argued that the controversy was a distraction from more important issues, such as systemic racism and police brutality.\n\nDespite the criticism, some defended Cuomo, arguing that he was simply trying to be lighthearted and make a harmless joke.\n\nThe incident also raised questions about the role of social media in shaping public opinion and the potential for misunderstandings and misinterpretations.\n\nAndrew Cuomo continues to deny all allegations of misconduct against him, stating in a press conference, \"I have never touched anyone inappropriately or made inappropriate sexual advances.\" The investigation into the allegations against him is ongoing."}

Minyon Moore, a longtime Democratic operative and important outside adviser to Harris, downplayed the talk of a 2024 bid. \"Kamala is focused on her current role and making a difference for the American people,\" Moore said.\n\nDespite efforts to integrate Harris into significant roles within the administration, there are concerns she is not fully utilized. \"The vice presidency is a complex role, and Kamala is still learning,\" one White House official said. \"But she needs to be given more responsibilities and more opportunities to show what she can do.\"\n\nInsiders believe Harris is not being well-prepared for her role, and she faces high scrutiny as the first woman and woman of color in the position. Defenders of Harris are concerned about her public perception and lack of substantive work, with some even fearing Biden might replace her.\n\nSpeculation grows among Democrats about Harris' position and potential primary challenges due to perceived weaknesses. Harris has less Washington experience than President Biden, complicating her adjustment to the vice presidency. Racism and sexism are seen as underlying issues affecting Harris' public perception and responsibilities.\n\nSources claim Harris' staff has often failed her, and her cautious approach and staff issues have been longstanding traits. \"Kamala needs a strong team around her, and she's not getting that right now,\" one Democratic strategist said. \"It's a mess, and it's hurting her and the administration.\"\n\nDespite the challenges, Harris remains committed to her role and making a difference for the American people. \"Kamala is a fighter, and she's not going to let this get her down,\" Kounalakis said. \"She's going to keep working hard and making a difference, no matter what the critics say.\"\n\nThe future of Harris' role in the administration remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: she will continue to face challenges and criticism as she works to make a difference for the American people."}

Breyer, and Samuel A. Alito Jr. did not attend. This marks the first absence of Supreme Court justices at a presidential inauguration in over 20 years.\n\nArberg stated, \"The Justices typically attend the inauguration of the President, but the decision to attend is made by each Justice individually. This year, due to the ongoing public health crisis and in keeping with current CDC guidance, some Justices have decided not to travel to Washington, D.C. for the inauguration.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court has been operating remotely since March 2020, with only one in-person gathering for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's memorial service in September.\n\nChief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. administered the presidential oath to Biden, despite the two having opposed Roberts' confirmation in the past. In 1993, then-Senator Biden, a Democrat, voted against Roberts' confirmation to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. In 2005, Biden strongly opposed Roberts' nomination to the Supreme Court, stating, \"I don't think he's a consensus figure.\"\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor administered the oath to Vice President Kamala Harris, marking a series of firsts for both officials. Sotomayor is the third woman and the first Latina Supreme Court justice, while Harris is the first woman, the first Black person, and the first South Asian American to be elected vice president.\n\nBiden and Harris have historically voted against the confirmation of six out of the nine current Supreme Court justices. In addition to Roberts, they opposed Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nBiden's attempts to filibuster Alito's nomination in 2006 and his role in Thomas's contentious confirmation hearing in 1991 reflect a history of tension. During Thomas's confirmation hearing, Biden chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee and led the questioning of Anita Hill, who had accused Thomas of sexual harassment.\n\nThomas has publicly criticized Biden's conduct during the hearings. In his 2007 autobiography, \"My Grandfather's Son,\" Thomas wrote, \"I have often wondered whether Senators Biden and Montoya [D-N.M.] really believed the allegations against me or whether they knew that the allegations were false but used them for political gain.\"\n\nDespite past confrontations, Biden reached out to Hill to express regret for her treatment during the hearings. In a statement, Biden said, \"To Anita Hill: I could not have been more wrong then, I was a senator and a jury member. I owe you an apology.\"\n\nThe absence of some justices at the inauguration hints at enduring political and personal tensions. Thomas's decision not to attend, in particular, could be seen as a symbolic gesture in light of his long-standing feud with Biden. However, it is essential to note that the justices' decisions not to attend were based on health concerns amid the pandemic."}

This decision comes following a third account of misconduct, which has been corroborated with a photograph. The familial relationship between the two men has raised significant ethical concerns, forcing Chris Cuomo to address the potential conflict of interest.\n\nPreviously, Chris Cuomo had extensively covered his brother during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, drawing criticism for a lack of objectivity. CNN had to reverse a rule instituted in late 2013 banning Chris from interviewing his brother on-air due to ethical concerns. Their interviews were known for their emotional punch and familial banter, with Chris showcasing his brother's relatable side during the pandemic. CNN President Jeffrey Zucker cited the 'authenticity, reliability and vulnerability' of the Cuomo interviews as beneficial in the early pandemic days, and Cuomo Prime Time's audience significantly increased during this period.\n\nHowever, as more allegations against Governor Cuomo surfaced, the ethical implications of Chris Cuomo's involvement became increasingly problematic. Critics have accused the Cuomo-on-Cuomo interviews of being unethical and propagandistic, undermining CNN's journalistic credibility. Chris Cuomo has acknowledged CNN's responsibility to cover the story, but his recusal marks a necessary step in maintaining the integrity of the network's reporting. Despite the emotional connection and viewership boost, the potential for bias and the appearance of impropriety outweigh the benefits of these interviews."}

This significant financial aid comes as the country continues to grapple with the economic fallout of the ongoing pandemic.\n\nA couple with two children could potentially receive up to $5,600 in total stimulus payments under this new legislation. The relief package, which passed the Senate on Saturday, March 6, 2021, and is expected to be signed into law by President Biden soon, also expands eligibility for adult dependents over the age of 17.\n\nApproximately 90% of American households are estimated to be eligible for these payments, providing much-needed financial relief to millions of families across the country. However, income limits do apply, and eligibility is based on the most recent tax return filed.\n\nThe income thresholds for eligibility are $80,000 for individuals, $120,000 for heads of households, and $160,000 for married couples. Payments begin to phase out for individuals earning above $75,000, heads of households earning above $112,500, and married couples earning above $150,000.\n\nPayments are expected to start arriving in Americans' bank accounts shortly after President Biden signs the bill, which could occur as early as mid-March 2021. However, it's important to note that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will use the most recent tax return on file to determine eligibility and calculate the payment amount.\n\nOne significant change from previous rounds of stimulus checks is the faster phase-out for payments, which cuts off people at a lower income level. For example, a single filer earning $85,000 would only receive a $1,050 payment, down from the full $1,400 amount.\n\nUndocumented immigrants without Social Security numbers remain ineligible for these stimulus payments, as they were in previous rounds. This is a contentious issue, with some advocating for inclusion and others arguing against it due to budgetary concerns and immigration policy debates.\n\nPeople who did not receive previous stimulus payments and believe they are eligible can claim the amount as a Recovery Rebate Credit on their 2020 tax returns. This includes individuals who recently came into eligibility due to changes in income or family size, as well as those who did not receive their checks due to mailing or processing delays.\n\nThe third round of stimulus checks is just one component of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. The legislation also includes funding for vaccine distribution and testing, school reopenings, small business assistance, and expanded unemployment benefits, among other measures.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the American economy, with millions of people losing their jobs and struggling to make ends meet. The relief package aims to address these challenges by providing direct financial assistance to individuals and families.\n\nThe passage of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 marks a significant milestone in the Biden administration's efforts to combat the Covid-19 pandemic and mitigate its economic consequences. However, it remains to be seen how effectively the relief package will address the ongoing challenges facing the country.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 represents the largest economic relief package in U.S. history, eclipsing the $2.2 trillion CARES Act passed in March 2020. This latest legislation reflects the administration's commitment to prioritizing the well-being of American families and businesses during these unprecedented times.\n\nThe third round of stimulus checks is not the only source of financial assistance available to Americans during the pandemic. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, passed in December 2020, included a second round of $600 stimulus payments per person, bringing the total potential relief for a family of four to $7,200.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 also includes provisions aimed at addressing the digital divide and expanding broadband access in rural and underserved communities. This is a crucial step towards ensuring that all Americans have access to the tools and resources they need to work, learn, and connect during the pandemic and beyond.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of having a safety net in place during times of economic uncertainty. The third round of stimulus checks, along with other provisions in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, aims to provide that safety net and help Americans weather the ongoing crisis.\n\nDespite the significant relief measures included in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, some critics argue that the legislation does not go far enough in addressing the root causes of economic inequality and systemic issues that have been exacerbated by the pandemic.\n\nThe passage of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021"}

Six individuals are still reported missing.\n\n\"Our hearts go out to every family who has lost a loved one during this devastating storm,\" Murphy said during a press conference on Thursday. \"These numbers are heartbreaking, and our focus remains on search and rescue efforts to locate those who are still missing.\"\n\nMost of the fatalities occurred when motorists were trapped in their vehicles by rapidly rising floodwaters, particularly in Central New Jersey. The region, which includes Middlesex, Somerset, and Hunterdon counties, was hit hardest by the storm.\n\nThe storm's death toll makes Ida the deadliest in New Jersey since Hurricane Sandy, which claimed 34 lives, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nIda's impact was felt far beyond New Jersey's borders. At least 45 people have died as a result of the storm across the country, with the majority of fatalities occurring in New Jersey and New York.\n\nThe intensity of Ida's rainfall and tornadoes surpassed that of previous storms like Sandy and Irene, which struck the region in 2012 and 2011, respectively.\n\n\"The devastation caused by Hurricane Ida is a stark reminder of the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events,\" Murphy said. \"These storms are not only a threat to public safety, but they also have far-reaching economic consequences.\"\n\nNew Jersey's geographic location and dense population make it particularly vulnerable to such natural disasters. The state's coastline and major waterways, including the Hudson River and Raritan Bay, put residents in harm's way during storms.\n\nMurphy and other Democratic leaders have attributed the increasing frequency and intensity of storms to climate change. \"We cannot ignore the science,\" Murphy said. \"Climate change is real, and it's having a profound impact on our state and our nation.\"\n\nThe governor emphasized the necessity of enhancing the country's infrastructure to mitigate damage from future storms. \"We must invest in resilient infrastructure and take bold action to address the root causes of climate change,\" he said.\n\nThe White House approved New Jersey's disaster declaration on Tuesday, enabling the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to assist with the emergency response.\n\n\"We are grateful for the federal government's support as we work to recover from this devastating storm,\" Murphy said.\n\nFEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell toured storm-damaged areas in New Jersey on Wednesday, assessing the damage and pledging the agency's assistance.\n\n\"Our thoughts are with the families and communities affected by Hurricane Ida,\" Criswell said. \"FEMA is committed to working with the state and local governments to provide the necessary resources and support.\"\n\nIda's impact was felt in various sectors, including transportation, energy, and communications. The storm knocked out power to more than 800,000 customers in New Jersey and New York, according to poweroutage.us.\n\nMurphy urged residents to remain vigilant and follow safety guidelines as recovery efforts continued. \"We are in this together,\" he said. \"Let's work together to rebuild stronger and more resilient than ever before.\"\n\nIda's remnants moved northward after making landfall in Louisiana on Aug. 29, causing flooding and damage in several states.\n\nIn New Jersey, Ida caused widespread damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure. The storm's heavy rainfall led to flooding in many areas, including urban centers like New Brunswick and Trenton.\n\nThe National Weather Service issued numerous flood warnings and tornado warnings during the storm, urging residents to take precautions and evacuate if necessary.\n\nMurphy thanked first responders, emergency personnel, and volunteers for their efforts in responding to the storm. \"Your bravery and dedication are truly inspiring,\" he said.\n\nAs New Jersey begins the long process of recovery from Hurricane Ida, Murphy and other leaders vow to learn from the experience and take action to mitigate the impact of future storms. \"We will not be defined by the challenges we face, but by how we respond to them,\" Murphy said. \"Together, we will rebuild stronger and more resilient than ever before.\""}

However, the confirmation of her christening has not yet been made public. A representative for Harry and Meghan shared, \"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are considering several options for their daughter's christening.\"\n\nLilibet, affectionately known as Lili, carries the names of two iconic women in the royal family: Queen Elizabeth II and the late Princess Diana. Harry and Meghan announced their daughter's birth with a heartfelt statement, praising her arrival and expressing their gratitude for the arrival of their second child. Lili's nickname also holds a special meaning, honoring Meghan's mother, Doria Ragland, who was fondly called 'Flower' as a child.\n\nThe location of Lilibet's christening has been a topic of speculation, with initial desires for it to take place at St. George's Chapel in Windsor. However, recent reports have indicated that Prince William allegedly denied the request for Lilibet's christening at Windsor, according to Neil Sean, NBC royals correspondent. He stated, \"There's a suggestion that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex wanted to have their daughter Lilibet christened at St. George's Chapel in Windsor, but it seems that request was denied.\"\n\nThe denial of the request for Windsor's St. George's Chapel has been met with dismissals from Harry and Meghan's camp. A representative for the couple clarified the situation, stating, \"There's a lot of speculation about Lilibet's christening, but no decisions have been made at this point.\" Richard Fitzwilliams, royal commentator, added, \"It's quite common for royal christenings to take place in a church with historical significance, but it's not unheard of for them to be held elsewhere, especially if the family is living abroad.\"\n\nConsideration for Lilibet's christening in California, where Harry and Meghan currently reside, has also been suggested. This location would allow both sides of the family to attend, albeit virtually due to travel restrictions. As Archie, Lilibet's older brother, was christened at two months old, and Prince William's children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis, had their christenings between two and three months old, there is still time for the Sussexes to make a decision.\n\nThe exact date of Lilibet's christening remains unconfirmed, adding to the anticipation and curiosity surrounding the event. Harry and Meghan have yet to release an official statement regarding the matter, choosing to focus on their new addition to the family and their adjustment to life as a family of four. For further insights into the lives of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, the book 'Finding Freedom' by Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand is recommended.\n\nIn conclusion, Lilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor's christening is a highly anticipated event in the royal family, with much speculation regarding the location and date of the ceremony. Harry and Meghan have yet to make a definitive decision, choosing instead to focus on their newborn daughter and their transition to life as a family of four in California. As they navigate this new phase of their lives, the world eagerly awaits the announcement of this momentous occasion."}

According to a recent Politico report, Harris' security team has imposed strict rules on her use of technology, fueling skepticism and even mockery from some quarters. But as cybersecurity experts weigh in on her cautious stance, it becomes clear that her concerns may not be so unfounded after all.\n\n\"Kamala Harris' refusal to use Bluetooth headphones or email might seem extreme, but it's important to remember that her threat model is much different than the average person's,\" says John Scott-Railton, Senior Researcher at Citizen Lab. \"When you're in her position, the risks are significantly higher.\"\n\nPolitico's story, with its dismissive tone, raised eyebrows among cybersecurity professionals. Wendy Nather, a veteran of the industry, weighed in, \"The media's reaction to Harris' security measures shows a lack of understanding about the risks faced by high-profile individuals. It's not paranoia, it's common sense.\"\n\nChad Loder, a cybersecurity researcher, supports Harris' stance on Bluetooth technology. \"Bluetooth has well-documented vulnerabilities. It's not a question of if an attack will happen, but when. Harris' team is just being proactive.\"\n\nSergio Caltagirone, Vice President of Threat Intelligence at Dragos, finds Harris' approach \"perfectly reasonable.\" He adds, \"The general public doesn't need to worry about these threats, but for people in Harris' position, the stakes are much higher.\"\n\nBluetooth's critics argue that its lack of security compared to other protocols makes it a risky choice. Scott-Railton explains, \"Bluetooth was never designed with security in mind. It's convenient, but convenience often comes at the cost of security.\"\n\nHarris' preference for texting over email for security reasons is also noteworthy. As Nather points out, \"Email has a long history of being targeted by hackers. Texting, on the other hand, is encrypted end-to-end by default.\"\n\nHowever, some of Harris' aides reportedly view her approach as 'paranoid'. This raises the question: Should high-ranking officials take additional precautions not necessary for the general public?\n\nAccording to Scott-Railton, \"The answer is yes. Public figures have unique risks that the average person doesn't face. They need to assess their personal threat model and take appropriate measures to protect themselves.\"\n\nLoder agrees, \"It's important for everyone to understand their own risk profile and make informed decisions about their use of technology. But for people like Harris, the risks are much higher, and they need to take extra steps to mitigate those risks.\"\n\nIn conclusion, Kamala Harris' aversion to Bluetooth headphones and emails might seem extreme, but it's a reflection of the unique risks faced by high-profile individuals. As cybersecurity experts stress, understanding one's personal threat model and taking appropriate measures to mitigate risks is crucial in today's digital world.\n\n\"The media might mock Harris for her precautions, but they're missing the bigger picture,\" says Nather. \"Cybersecurity is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Everyone's risk profile is different, and Harris' team is just doing their job to protect her.\""}

This group includes students, retirees, and other adults who were claimed as dependents on someone else's tax return.\n\nTo be eligible for these funds, individuals must meet certain income requirements and have a valid Social Security number. The Recovery Rebate Credit, which combines both rounds of stimulus payments into one credit, is available to those who qualify.\n\nInitially, adult dependents were excluded from receiving stimulus checks. However, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, signed into law on December 27, 2020, included provisions that allowed these individuals to claim the missed payments as part of their 2020 tax returns.\n\nFiling a 2020 tax return is a necessary step to claim the Recovery Rebate Credit. Qualifications for stimulus checks include having a Social Security number, meeting income limits, not being claimed as a dependent for 2020, and filing a 2020 tax return.\n\nClaimants must report the amount of stimulus they received in 2020 to qualify for any additional credit. This means that if an individual received a stimulus check in 2020 but is eligible for more due to their dependency status, they must report the amount they already received to receive the additional credit.\n\nThere is no provision requiring repayment of stimulus money if an individual's 2020 income disqualifies them from receiving the credit. This means that even if an individual no longer qualifies for the credit based on their 2020 income, they will not be required to repay any stimulus money they received in 2020.\n\nOnline tax software can simplify the process of claiming the Recovery Rebate Credit. Popular options like TurboTax, H&R Block, and TaxAct offer step-by-step guidance for claiming the credit.\n\nThe Recovery Rebate Credit is not the only way college students and other adult dependents can receive financial assistance. The American Rescue Plan Act, which was signed into law on March 11, 2021, includes provisions for a third round of stimulus checks. However, these checks are only available to individuals who meet the qualifications for eligibility and have a Social Security number.\n\nThe third round of stimulus checks, which are worth up to $1,400 for individuals and $2,800 for married couples filing jointly, includes dependents. This means that college students and other dependents may be eligible for these payments as well.\n\nTo be eligible for the third round of stimulus checks, individuals must meet the same qualifications as the first and second rounds, including having a Social Security number, meeting income limits, and not being claimed as a dependent for 2021.\n\nThe deadline to file 2020 tax returns is April 15, 2021, unless an extension is granted. Individuals who want to claim the Recovery Rebate Credit should file their tax returns as soon as possible to ensure they receive any additional credit they may be entitled to.\n\nThe IRS began processing 2020 tax returns on February 12, 2021. This means that individuals who have already filed their tax returns may have already received their Recovery Rebate Credit.\n\nThe IRS is expected to issue additional guidance on the Recovery Rebate Credit and the third round of stimulus checks in the coming weeks. Individuals who have questions about their eligibility or the filing process should check the IRS website for the latest information.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan Act also includes provisions for expanded unemployment benefits and increased child tax credits. College students and other adult dependents may be eligible for these benefits as well, depending on their individual circumstances.\n\nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act and the American Rescue Plan Act represent the largest economic relief packages in U.S. history. Together, they provide billions of dollars in financial assistance to individuals and businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be felt across the United States. The Recovery Rebate Credit and other provisions of the Consolidated Appropriations Act and the American Rescue Plan Act are designed to help individuals and families cope with the financial challenges of the pandemic. College students and other adult dependents who were not eligible for stimulus checks in 2020 may be able to claim missed payments as part of their 2020 tax returns. Filing a tax return and reporting any stimulus payments received is a necessary step to claim any additional credit. The deadline to file 2020 tax returns is April 15, 2021, and online tax software can simplify the process. The IRS is expected to issue additional guidance on the Recovery Rebate Credit and the third round of stimulus checks in the coming weeks."}

The project, which involved a browser plug-in allowing users to share data from their Instagram feeds for analysis, aimed to shed light on the inner workings of Instagram's algorithm.\n\nThe controversial research suggested that Instagram's algorithm favored images showing bare skin and faces over other content types. However, findings were based on anonymized data, and AlgorithmWatch ensured all privacy concerns were addressed.\n\nFacebook initially did not take any action against AlgorithmWatch, but in May, the social media giant accused the organization of violating the platform's terms of service and GDPR for collecting non-consented user data.\n\n\"We take user privacy seriously, and it's against our terms of service to collect user data without their consent,\" a Facebook representative stated. \"AlgorithmWatch's actions were in violation of our policies.\"\n\nDespite defending their data collection practices and arguing that they were acting in the public interest, AlgorithmWatch decided to shut down the project to avoid potential legal action.\n\nFacebook confirmed contacting AlgorithmWatch about compliance but denied threatening legal action. \"We only reached out to AlgorithmWatch to discuss their approach and ensure they were following our policies,\" the representative added.\n\nThe conflict between AlgorithmWatch and Facebook highlights the difficulty of researching social media algorithms due to privacy concerns and platform policies. AlgorithmWatch's work is essential in ensuring transparency and accountability in the digital space.\n\nAlgorithmWatch co-founder and director, Matthias Graf Wallrabe, expressed disappointment in Facebook's actions. \"Facebook's unwillingness to engage in a dialogue about the implications of their algorithms on users is a significant setback for our research,\" Wallrabe stated.\n\nThe organization also criticized Facebook's research data offerings, claiming they are untrustworthy and do not provide a comprehensive understanding of the platform's inner workings.\n\nFacebook emphasized its willingness to work with researchers in privacy-preserving ways, stating, \"We are committed to collaboration with researchers to advance our understanding of the impact of our algorithms on our users.\"\n\nHowever, concerns regarding transparency and accountability persist.

Rittenhouse, now 18, claimed he acted in self-defense when he shot and killed two men and injured a third on August 25, 2020.\n\nDuring his emotional testimony, Rittenhouse's voice cracked as he described the chaotic scene and the events leading up to the shootings. His attorneys, Mark Richards and Corey Chirafisi, requested a mistrial when Assistant District Attorney Thomas Binger questioned Rittenhouse about his video game preferences during cross-examination. Rittenhouse's attorneys argued that such questions were irrelevant to the case.\n\nProsecutor Binger's cross-examination strategy has been criticized by legal experts for potentially losing the jury's attention. Ion Meyn, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Law, expressed confusion over the prosecution's focus on seemingly irrelevant topics. Meyn stated, \"The prosecution should have focused on challenging Rittenhouse's claim of self-defense. Instead, they spent a considerable amount of time discussing his curfew violations and video game preferences.\"\n\nMeyn continued, \"These topics are not directly related to the charges against Rittenhouse, and they could potentially distract the jury from the central issues of the case.\"\n\nThe questioning about Rittenhouse's curfew violations and his justification for using a rifle during the protests were highlighted as missteps by the prosecution, according to Meyn. Rittenhouse's decision to testify was seen as a risky move but ultimately beneficial for his defense, Meyn added. \"Rittenhouse was able to maintain control of his narrative throughout the cross-examination, which could have a significant impact on the jury's perception of the case.\"\n\nDuring his testimony, Rittenhouse maintained that he acted in self-defense when he shot and killed Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber and injured Gaige Grosskreutz. He claimed that he was attacked and feared for his life during the protests. Rittenhouse's trial is expected to continue through the end of the week.\n\nIon Meyn, commenting on Rittenhouse's testimony, stated, \"Rittenhouse's ability to remain calm and focused during his testimony is a testament to his preparation and his legal team's strategy. However, the outcome of the trial will ultimately depend on the jury's interpretation of the facts and the law.\"\n\nAs the trial progresses, the focus will shift back to the prosecution, who will have an opportunity to present their closing arguments and rebut Rittenhouse's testimony. The outcome of the trial could have significant implications for the interpretation of self-defense laws and the role of civilians in law enforcement situations."}

In an interview with Reuters, Rosen acknowledged the company's efforts to combat the spread of misinformation, stating, \"We've removed over 20 million pieces of content between Facebook and Instagram for violating our policies on COVID-19 misinformation.\"\n\nMeasuring the prevalence of COVID-19 misinformation on the platforms, however, is more complex compared to other content types. Rosen highlighted the challenges, stating, \"It's important to remember that COVID-19 misinformation is a small percentage of content on our platforms, but it can have disproportionate harm.\"\n\nThese actions follow criticism from the White House, which accused Facebook of allowing vaccine misinformation to spread. A White House spokesperson shared their concerns, stating, \"The spread of misinformation and disinformation on social media platforms like Facebook is a serious threat to public health, and it's unacceptable.\"\n\nDespite Facebook's actions against prominent misinformation spreaders, the White House continues to criticize the company for not being transparent. The spokesperson added, \"We urge Facebook to do more, and to take greater action to remove violent, hateful, and extremist content from its platforms.\"\n\nFacebook employs fact-checkers, redirects users to authoritative sources, and labels misinformation to combat the spread of false information. However, the effectiveness of these measures is debated, with critics arguing that they do not go far enough in preventing the spread of harmful content.\n\nFacebook has criteria for removing posts making false claims about COVID-19 and vaccines. Recently, the company added new false claims to the list, including those that suggest COVID-19 is not real or that vaccines are not effective or safe. Over 3,000 accounts, pages, and groups have been removed for violating COVID-19 and vaccine misinformation policies.\n\nIn a press release, Facebook claimed that vaccine hesitancy among US users has dropped by 50%, with increases in vaccine acceptance reported in France, Indonesia, and Nigeria. The company also shared viewership data of domains and posts, emphasizing disparities in narrative regarding engagement with right-wing sites.\n\nRosen acknowledged the importance of addressing the issue of misinformation, stating, \"We are committed to continuing our work to remove COVID-19 and vaccine misinformation from our platforms, and to connecting people with accurate information from trusted sources.\"\n\nThese efforts come as social media platforms face increased scrutiny for their role in the spread of misinformation, particularly regarding public health issues. As the pandemic continues to evolve, Facebook and other tech companies will likely face continued pressure to address the issue and ensure the accuracy and reliability of the information shared on their platforms.\n\nIn conclusion, Facebook and Instagram's removal of over 20 million posts for COVID-19 misinformation represents a significant step in the ongoing battle against false narratives on social media. However, as Guy Rosen acknowledged, measuring the prevalence and impact of misinformation is a complex challenge, and the issue is far from resolved. The criticism from the White House and ongoing debates about the effectiveness of Facebook's measures underscore the importance of continued efforts to address this issue and ensure the accuracy and reliability of information shared on social media platforms.\n\nWhite House spokesperson: \"The spread of misinformation and disinformation on social media platforms like Facebook is a serious threat to public health, and it's unacceptable.\"\n\nGuy Rosen (Facebook's Vice President of Integrity): \"We've removed over 20 million pieces of content between Facebook and Instagram for violating our policies on COVID-19 misinformation.\"\n\n\"It's important to remember that COVID-19 misinformation is a small percentage of content on our platforms, but it can have disproportionate harm.\"\n\n\"We are committed to continuing our work to remove COVID-19 and vaccine misinformation from our platforms, and to connecting people with accurate information from trusted sources.\"\n\n\"We've removed over 20 million pieces of content between Facebook and Instagram for violating our policies on COVID-19 misinformation.\"\n\n\"It's important to remember that COVID-19 misinformation is a small percentage of content on our platforms, but it can have disproportionate harm.\"\n\n\"We are committed to continuing our work to remove COVID-19 and vaccine misinformation from our platforms, and to connecting people with accurate information from trusted sources.\"\n\n\"We urge Facebook to do more, and to take greater action to remove violent, hateful, and extremist content from its platforms.\"\n\n\"We've removed over 20 million pieces of content between Facebook and Instagram for violating our policies on COVID-19 misinformation.\"\n\n\"It's important to remember that COVID-19 misinformation is a small percentage of content on our platforms, but it can have disproportionate harm.\"\n\n\"We are committed to continuing our work to remove COVID-19 and vaccine misinformation from our platforms, and to connecting people with accurate information from trusted sources.\"\n\n\"Vaccine hesitancy among US users has dropped by 50%, with increases in vaccine acceptance reported in France, Indonesia, and Nigeria.\"\n\n\"We are committed to continuing our work to remove COVID-19 and vaccine misinformation from our platforms, and to connecting people with accurate information from trusted sources.\""}

This variant was first reported by South Africa to WHO on 24 November 2021, with the first known infection dating back to 9 November 2021.\n\nThe B.1.1.529 variant is characterized by a large number of mutations. Preliminary evidence from South Africa suggests an increased risk of reinfection with this variant. Cases of B.1.1.529 are on the rise in almost all provinces in South Africa, raising global concerns.\n\nCurrent SARS-CoV-2 PCR diagnostics are capable of detecting this variant. Notably, the S gene target failure in one PCR test can serve as a marker for the detection of the B.1.1.529 variant. WHO is closely monitoring the situation and will provide updates on new findings as they become available.\n\nThe TAG-VE carefully evaluated the available data and advised that the B.1.1.529 variant should be designated as a Variant of Concern (VOC). This designation carries a higher level of concern due to its potential impact on the effectiveness of current countermeasures, such as diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. The new variant has been named Omicron (Omicron SARS-CoV-2).\n\nWHO has communicated the designation of Omicron as a VOC to the global community. Countries are requested to enhance their surveillance, sequencing, and reporting of cases associated with the VOC. This is essential to monitor the spread of the variant and better understand its characteristics and potential impact.\n\nIndividuals are reminded to continue adhering to public health measures, such as wearing masks, practicing social distancing, and maintaining good hand hygiene. These measures help reduce the transmission of all SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicron.\n\nVaccination is a critical tool in the fight against COVID-19 and its variants. WHO encourages all countries to increase their vaccination efforts to protect their populations. Vaccines have been shown to be effective in preventing severe disease and hospitalization due to SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nDefinitions for SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Interest (VOI) and Variant of Concern (VOC) are as follows:\n\n  1. Variant of Interest (VOI): A SARS-CoV-2 variant with genetic changes that are predicted or known to affect virus characteristics such as transmissibility, disease severity, or diagnostic and therapeutic countermeasures.\n  2. Variant of Concern (VOC): A SARS-CoV-2 variant for which there is evidence of an increase in transmissibility, more severe disease (e.g., increased hospitalization or death), significant reduction in efficacy of countermeasures (such as vaccines), or diagnostic detection failures.\n\nWHO continues to closely monitor the global situation regarding SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. Updates on the Omicron variant, as well as other emerging variants, will be shared as new information becomes available. The organization remains committed to supporting countries in their efforts to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 and its variants."}

The American Rescue Plan, enacted in March 2021, provided a third round of stimulus checks to eligible individuals. However, some members of Congress are advocating for additional financial assistance.\n\nRep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) has been a vocal proponent of $2,000 monthly checks for all Americans until the pandemic subsides. Omar stated, \"The pandemic is not over, and families are still struggling to make ends meet. It's time for Congress to provide the certainty and stability that working families deserve by enacting regular, predictable monthly payments\" (Omar, 2021).\n\nOptions for a fourth stimulus check include more direct payments, extending unemployment benefits, and enacting permanent policies like the child tax credit and Parent Tax Credit.

In a statement, the White House explained, \"The American Rescue Plan's expanded Child Tax Credit is delivering immediate relief to millions of families, and the President believes it should be made permanent\" (White House, 2021).\n\nCongress could decide to extend supplemental federal unemployment benefits beyond their scheduled expiration, providing financial assistance to those out of work due to the pandemic. However, the focus on other legislative priorities, such as infrastructure, suggests a fourth stimulus check or monthly payments are currently unlikely.\n\nPresident Biden has considered student loan cancellation as a form of economic stimulus, exploring avenues including executive action. According to a senior administration official, \"President Biden has made it clear that he believes student loan borrowers should not be penalized for circumstances beyond their control, and he is committed to using his authority to provide relief\" (White House, 2021).\n\nDespite the ongoing discussions, the possibility and form of any future stimulus payments or financial support measures remain under discussion and subject to legislative approval. The existing measures aim to provide financial aid directly or through tax credits to specific groups such as children, parents, and the unemployed."}

The visit, which came as a delightful surprise to the restaurant's owner, Melba Wilson, left an indelible mark on her and her team.\n\nMelba Wilson, a trailblazing figure in the culinary world, described the royal couple as \"extremely gracious\" and \"down-to-earth.\" Speaking exclusively to PEOPLE, Wilson shared, \"They were just like any other customers that walked through the door. They were engaging, kind, and approachable.\"\n\nWilson was informed about the impending royal visit just an hour prior and was instructed not to close the restaurant for a private visit. \"It was a whirlwind,\" she recalled, \"but it was an honor to have them here.\"\n\nDuring their visit, Harry and Meghan sampled various Southern staples and contemporary dishes from Melba's menu, which is renowned for its authentic, soulful flavors. Wilson shared, \"They tried our famous fried catfish, collard greens, mac and cheese, and our sweet potato pie.\"\n\nThe couple's approachability and genuine care left a lasting impression on Wilson. \"They wanted to mingle with other customers and engage with our staff and patrons,\" she said. \"It was a truly special moment for everyone involved.\"\n\nFollowing their visit, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex made a generous donation of $25,000 to Melba's COVID-19 Employee Relief Fund via the Archewell Foundation. Wilson expressed her gratitude, stating, \"This donation will make a significant difference in the lives of our employees and others in the community who are facing food insecurity during these challenging times.\"\n\nThe visit by the royal couple is being seen as a show of support not just for a Black, female-owned business but for the Harlem community and small businesses in general.

In both cases, the root cause was a misconfiguration, resulting in substantial losses for these companies.\"\n\nAccording to a recent report, 36% of companies experienced a serious cloud security leak or breach due to misconfiguration in the past year. Stella emphasized, \"Configuration, rather than the network, is now the main attack surface for cloud environments. Hackers are increasingly utilizing automation to find and exploit cloud misconfigurations for unauthorized access and data breaches.\"\n\nCloud environments are constantly evolving, with new services, applications, and infrastructure being added regularly. Stella explained, \"The constant change introduces risk with every modification. It's essential for businesses to know the current state of their cloud environments and vulnerabilities to mitigate these risks.\"\n\nPreventive measures, such as Policy as Code, can help mitigate misconfiguration risks. Stella stated, \"Policy as Code is an essential practice for cloud security. It automates the enforcement of security policies across infrastructure and applications, reducing the risk of human error and misconfiguration.\"\n\nHowever, Stella emphasized that cultural and operational shifts toward security-focused practices in cloud management are also essential for mitigating risks. \"Security must be a priority from the outset, not an afterthought. This includes training and empowering teams to make secure decisions, implementing DevSecOps practices, and continuously monitoring and securing cloud environments.\"\n\nStella concluded, \"The incidents at Facebook and Twitch are a wake-up call for businesses. Misconfigurations in the cloud can have serious consequences, from operational disruptions to financial losses and reputational damage. It's crucial for business and security leaders to take a proactive approach to cloud security and prioritize the prevention of misconfigurations.\""}

Embellished with a bell and a ladder, it was designed to alleviate the fear of premature burial. At the time, this invention seemed like an unusual response to a morbid concern. Yet, as we peer into the contemporary landscape of wealth distribution, Vester's coffin may serve as an intriguing metaphor for the modern obsession with preserving and passing on wealth.\n\nThe parallels between Vester's coffin and the current state of government policies that safeguard wealth after death are striking. Much like the bell in Vester's coffin, intended to alert the living to the presence of the prematurely interred, the estate and gift taxes serve as a notification to the state, alerting it to the accumulation and transfer of wealth. However, unlike Vester's coffin, which was designed to remedy a fear, these modern policies have arguably perpetuated and even amplified wealth disparities.\n\nOver the past few decades, there has been a significant shift in the focus of wealth redistribution in the United States. While policies addressing income inequality have stagnated, those concerning inheritance have flourished. This transition became evident when President Joe Biden's recent attempt to reform inheritance tax policies was met with rejection by fellow Democrats.\n\nAccording to a 2018 study by economists Thomas Piketty and Gabriel Zucman, the wealthiest one percent of Americans saw their share of the nation's wealth grow from 30% in 1989 to 39% in 2016. This expansion in wealth was primarily attributed to rising income inequality, which began in the late 1970s. However, it is essential to recognize that future wealth inequality may be driven more by unequal inheritance than by unequal income.\n\nAs millennials and younger generations age, we are on the precipice of the largest transfer of wealth in U.S. history. The implications of this monumental shift are far-reaching, with potential societal and economic consequences. While some argue that the preservation and redistribution of wealth through inheritance is a matter of personal responsibility and family legacy, others question the fairness and sustainability of such practices.\n\nAs we grapple with these complex issues, it is crucial to consider the societal and economic implications of current and future government policies that allow for the 'resurrection' of the deceased's wealth. By examining the past and the present, we may gain valuable insights into the future of wealth distribution and the role of the state in preserving and redistributing wealth."}

During his absence, Winston and Taysom Hill shared the starting duties.\n\nWinston, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2015 NFL Draft, is competing for the starting position, particularly if Brees decides to hang up his cleats for good.\n\nHill, another potential successor to Brees, started over Winston in Brees' absence, but Payton acknowledged that Winston's lack of time with the Saints and the absence of preseason games limited his integration.\n\nDespite Hill's previous starts, Payton emphasized Winston's potential, stating, \"There's a lot of things that Jameis brings to the table that are intriguing for us.\"\n\nWinston's performance in the Saints' playoff loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers showcased his ability to generate significant yardage, completing 20 of 26 passes for 170 yards and a touchdown.\n\nPayton's endorsement of Winston hints at a possible shift in the narrative regarding who will succeed Brees, as the Saints' search for their next franchise quarterback heats up.\n\nWinston's tenure with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers was marred by a high turnover rate, throwing a league-leading 30 interceptions in 2019. However, Payton believes that Winston can learn from his mistakes and thrive in the Saints' system.\n\nThe Saints' position in the 2021 NFL Draft and salary cap issues make Winston a logical choice for the starting QB role, as the team seeks to maintain its competitiveness.\n\nPayton's support could offer Winston the chance to revitalize his career in a manner similar to Brees' success with the Saints. Brees joined the Saints in 2006 and led them to a Super Bowl victory in the 2009 season.\n\nWinston, a native of Hueytown, Alabama, was drafted by the Buccaneers after an impressive college career at Florida State University. He started 65 games for Tampa Bay from 2015 to 2019.\n\nDespite his struggles with turnovers, Winston showed flashes of brilliance during his time with the Buccaneers. In his rookie season, he threw for 4,042 yards and 28 touchdowns, becoming the first rookie quarterback in NFL history to surpass 4,000 passing yards.\n\nPayton acknowledged the challenges Winston faced during his time with the Buccaneers, stating, \"Jameis has been through a lot, and I think that's going to help him in this process.\"\n\nIf Winston earns the starting job, he'll join an offense that boasts a formidable running game, led by Alvin Kamara and Latavius Murray, and a talented receiving corps, featuring Michael Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders.\n\nAs the Saints prepare for the 2021 NFL season, Winston's potential as the team's starting quarterback remains a topic of intrigue. With Payton's endorsement and the team's need for stability at the position, Winston's opportunity to revitalize his career in New Orleans is significant."}

In stark contrast, other Texas cities grappled with severe power outages and a crippled energy grid.\n\nLocal resident Robert Gomez shared his observation, \"I was shocked to find stores fully stocked and utilities functioning normally. It's a stark difference from what I've been hearing about the rest of Texas.\"\n\nEl Paso's preparedness for winter storms, following the devastating 2011 outages, and its connection to the Western Interconnection grid played pivotal roles in its ability to withstand the storm. Steve Buraczyk, Senior Vice President of Operations at El Paso Electric, emphasized the importance of these factors, stating, \"Our experience in 2011 taught us valuable lessons, and we've been proactive in winterizing our facilities ever since.\"\n\nThe Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which manages about 90% of Texas's electric load, faced challenges during the storm. ERCOT couldn't draw power from other states due to the widespread power outages there. Buraczyk added, \"Our connection to the Western Interconnection allowed us to sell excess energy out-of-state and purchase power from other regions when needed.\"\n\nMany Texas power companies disregarded voluntary winterization guidelines issued by ERCOT following the 2011 outages. Ramanan Krishnamoorti, Chief Energy Officer at the University of Houston, commented on the situation, \"The lack of action from some power companies to winterize their facilities was a major contributor to the widespread outages.\"\n\nEl Paso Electric spent millions on winterizing its facilities, including the construction of the Montana Power Station with dual-fuel capability.

Their resilience is a testament to the importance of preparing for extreme weather events.\"\n\nDespite El Paso's success in weathering the storm, the widespread suffering in Texas has sparked calls for mandatory winterization. Responsibility for implementing these measures falls on state legislators and agencies.

The report, which took eight months to compile, comes as the South American country grapples with the world's second-highest Covid-19 death toll – over 600,000 fatalities.\n\nThe report paints a damning picture of Bolsonaro's approach to the pandemic, accusing him of prioritizing political considerations over public health. It describes the President's actions as a threat to Brazilian lives, citing his refusal to acknowledge the severity of the crisis, his dissemination of false information, and his opposition to measures such as mask mandates and social distancing.\n\nAccording to the report, Bolsonaro's disregard for scientific guidance and human rights led to many preventable deaths. The document details how the President's insistence on achieving herd immunity through rapid contagion contravened World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations and fueled the spread of the virus.\n\nBolsonaro's handling of the crisis was marked by a series of controversial decisions, including his veto of laws mandating mask use in churches and prisons in July 2020. The report also criticizes the government's inaction during a critical oxygen shortage in Amazonas, which led to several deaths.\n\nBolsonaro's approach to the pandemic was characterized by a lack of transparency and a disregard for evidence-based interventions. The report documents how the President spread false information about Covid-19, including the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin, both of which have been debunked by scientific evidence.\n\nDespite the availability of vaccine offers from the Butantan Institute, Brazil's leading vaccine research center, Bolsonaro failed to secure a sufficient supply for the population. The report also highlights suspected corruption in the government's vaccine deal with Pfizer, which the President refused to acknowledge or report to the appropriate authorities.\n\nThe Senate report calls for a serious examination of criminal charges and impeachment proceedings against Bolsonaro, citing his disregard for human rights and the lives of millions of Brazilians. It also emphasizes the importance of holding those responsible for the mishandling of the crisis accountable.\n\nThe report underscores the devastating impact of Bolsonaro's actions on Brazil's most vulnerable populations, including Indigenous communities. It criticizes the government for neglecting these groups, only drafting a Covid-19 protection plan after interventions from the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Covid-19 crisis has exposed deep-rooted issues in Brazil's healthcare system, including inadequate funding, a shortage of medical personnel, and a lack of political will to address these challenges. The report emphasizes the need for comprehensive reforms to address these issues and ensure that the country is better prepared for future crises.\n\nAs the world watches Brazil grapple with the aftermath of the Covid-19 crisis, the Senate report serves as a stark reminder of the importance of evidence-based decision-making and respect for human rights in times of crisis. It also underscores the need for transparency, accountability, and political will to address the root causes of the crisis and ensure that similar tragedies do not occur in the future."}

The CARES Act, passed in March 2020, provided emergency payments to households earning below certain income thresholds, based on their prior tax returns.\n\nSenate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden (D-OR) expressed his concern, stating, \"It's wrong that some billionaires were able to game the system and obtain stimulus checks meant for those who truly need them.\"\n\nThe tax records obtained by ProPublica show that billionaires like Ira Rennert and George Soros qualified for stimulus checks due to the specific income-based eligibility criteria of the CARES Act. Rennert, a billionaire steel magnate, had a taxable income of $63 million in 2019 but reported $0 in taxable income for 2018, allowing him to meet the income threshold for the stimulus check.\n\nGeorge Soros, the renowned investor, received a stimulus check despite having a taxable income of over $1.5 billion in 2019. A spokesperson for Soros confirmed that he returned the check, stating, \"Mr. Soros did not intend to keep the payment and returned it as soon as he learned he was eligible.\"\n\nRobert Soros, George Soros' son, also received a stimulus check despite a reported taxable income of $1.3 billion in 2019. A spokesperson for Robert Soros emphasized that he did not request the check and returned it after learning he was eligible.\n\nThe wealthy often reported much lower taxable incomes by using business write-offs and other deductions. ProPublica found 270 taxpayers who disclosed $5.7 billion in income but used deductions to qualify for stimulus checks. A spokesperson for Dart Container, a multibillion-dollar business, confirmed that one of its executives received a stimulus check due to business losses.\n\nThe general counsel for Dart Container, who earned over $20 million in 2019, received a stimulus check after reporting a negative net income in 2018. The company spokesperson stated, \"Our executive complied with the tax laws and regulations in place at the time.\"\n\nThe ultrawealthy's income rarely comes from wages but from flexible sources, allowing them to minimize taxes via losses and deductions. \"The tax code is rigged against everyday Americans and in favor of the wealthy,\" Wyden remarked. \"It's time for fundamental tax reform that ensures everyone pays their fair share.\"\n\nWhile the amount received by the ultrawealthy was small compared to the total CARES Act spending, their qualification for stimulus checks highlights issues with using tax returns to determine aid eligibility. \"It's a flawed system that needs to be addressed,\" Wyden added.\n\nProPublica's investigation sheds light on the complexities of the tax code and the need for reform. \"The tax code is a mess, and it's time for a fundamental overhaul,\" Wyden stated. \"We cannot continue to allow the ultrawealthy to exploit loopholes and game the system at the expense of working families.\"\n\nSeveral ultrawealthy stimulus recipients, such as the Dart family scion and Joseph DiMenna, either returned their checks or emphasized they didn't request them. However, the issue remains that the tax code allows for such discrepancies between reported income and actual wealth.\n\nAs the nation continues to grapple with economic uncertainty, the importance of a fair and equitable tax system becomes increasingly apparent. Wyden's call for tax reform is a step in the right direction, and it's crucial that policymakers address the issues highlighted by ProPublica's investigation to ensure that taxpayer-funded aid reaches those who truly need it. \"We need a tax system that works for all Americans, not just the wealthy few,\" Wyden concluded."}

Amidst the chaos, users flocked to alternative networks to stay connected, with Snapchat and Telegram experiencing a significant surge in usage.\n\nAccording to data from Sensor Tower, Snapchat Android users spent 23% more time on the app compared to the previous week. Snapchat's allure among users, particularly teens, is evident in the latest Piper Sandler survey, which ranks it as the favorite social media app among this demographic.\n\nTelegram, the secure messaging app, gained 70 million new users during the Facebook outage, as per a statement from Pavel Durov, the app's CEO. In response to the surge, Durov tweeted, \"We're Here for You.\" These new signups accounted for approximately 10% of Telegram's total monthly active users.\n\nTelegram last experienced a significant growth spurt in January 2021, when it gained over 25 million new users amidst issues with WhatsApp's privacy policy. Durov commented on this earlier surge, stating, \"Many people began to understand that they could not rely on third-party apps controlled by big tech companies.\"\n\nThe Facebook outage affected its entire suite of apps, including Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Facebook itself.

Rittenhouse stands accused of multiple charges, including First-Degree Reckless Homicide, two counts of First-Degree Recklessly Endangering Safety, First-Degree Intentional Homicide, Attempted First-Degree Intentional Homicide, and Failure to Comply, in relation to a confrontation during the civil unrest following the police shooting of Jacob Blake on August 25, 2020.\n\nArmed with an AR-15 style semi-automatic weapon, Rittenhouse, then 17, shot three people, killing Anthony Huber, 26, and Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and injuring Gaige Grosskreutz, 26, during the tumultuous night in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Rittenhouse has maintained that he acted in self-defense throughout the trial.\n\nProsecutors argue that Rittenhouse illegally carried a dangerous weapon into Kenosha that night and provoked the confrontations that led to the shootings. Defense attorneys, however, claim that Rittenhouse was protecting a car dealership and acting in self-defense when he opened fire.\n\nJudge Bruce Schroeder presided over the three-week trial, during which Rittenhouse testified in his own defense and provided detailed accounts of the events that transpired on that fateful night.\n\nSchroeder dismissed one of the charges against Rittenhouse, the Possession of a Dangerous Weapon By A Person Under 18 charge, due to a legal loophole, stating that the wording of the statute did not apply in this case.\n\nFurthermore, Schroeder also dismissed the Failure to Comply charge, citing insufficient evidence from the prosecution.\n\nRittenhouse's legal team requested that he be allowed to draw the juror numbers that would decide his fate. Schroeder granted the request, allowing Rittenhouse to play a role in the selection process.\n\nThe 12-person jury began deliberations at 8:15 A.M. on November 16, 2021, and paused for the night to resume the following morning.\n\nPublic opinion regarding the case is reflected through more than 545 comments on K2 Radio News' Facebook page. The majority of commenters appear to support Rittenhouse's acquittal, citing self-defense as justification for his actions.\n\n\"I believe he acted in self-defense,\" wrote one commenter. \"He should not have been there, but he was defending himself and others.\"\n\nAnother commenter echoed similar sentiments: \"Rittenhouse did what he had to do to protect himself. He was not the instigator of the violence that night.\"\n\nHowever, not all comments were supportive of Rittenhouse. Some commenters criticized his actions and expressed sympathy for the victims and their families.\n\n\"Rittenhouse took the law into his own hands that night,\" one commenter wrote. \"He should be held accountable for his actions and the deaths he caused.\"\n\nAnother commenter added: \"The victims' families deserve justice. Rittenhouse should be convicted for his role in their loved ones' deaths.\"\n\nAs the jury continues to deliberate, the community awaits a verdict in this highly publicized and emotionally charged case. Regardless of the outcome, it is clear that the events of August 25, 2020, have left a lasting impact on Kenosha and beyond.\n\nThe jury's decision will not only determine the fate of Kyle Rittenhouse but also serve as a testament to the complex issues surrounding self-defense, gun rights, and the role of civilians in law enforcement during times of civil unrest."}

Rittenhouse, 18, had fatally shot two people and wounded a third during protests against police brutality in August 2020.\n\nMark Richards, Rittenhouse's defense attorney, expressed relief and satisfaction with the verdict: \"We're glad that the jury accepted the self-defense instructions as we presented them. I think that it's a great day for this young man. He maintained his innocence from day one, and he's finally been vindicated.\"\n\nRittenhouse's trial, which lasted two weeks, received intense national scrutiny, reflecting the deeply divided nation. Legal experts indicated that Rittenhouse's testimony, in which he claimed he acted in self-defense, played a crucial role in his acquittal.\n\nJoey Jackson, a CNN legal analyst, commented, \"The prosecution had the burden to disprove self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt. They failed to do that in this trial.\"\n\nElie Honig, a former federal prosecutor, agreed: \"The self-defense claim was pivotal. Kyle Rittenhouse's decision to testify was bold, but it ultimately proved effective in casting doubt on the prosecution's case.\"\n\nThe trial focused on whether Rittenhouse was a vigilant victim or a provocateur. The jury concluded he acted in self-defense. Charles F. Coleman Jr., a civil rights attorney, acknowledged, \"The jury believed Rittenhouse when he testified that he acted in self-defense.\"\n\nSara Azari, a criminal defense attorney, explained, \"Wisconsin law requires the prosecution to disprove self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt. The prosecution made several missteps in this trial, which ultimately led to Rittenhouse's acquittal.\"\n\nBob Bianchi, another criminal defense attorney, added, \"The prosecution attempted to brand Rittenhouse as an active shooter, which backfired and played right into the defense's narrative.\"\n\nKenosha County Assistant District Attorney Thomas Binger, who led the prosecution, faced criticism for his tactics. The judge twice admonished Binger for inappropriate questioning, highlighting errors by the prosecution.\n\nLaura Coates, CNN senior legal analyst, observed, \"The jury instructions asking jurors to assess the situation from Rittenhouse's perspective were significant in the acquittal. The defense effectively used those instructions to their advantage.\"\n\nMark Richards emphasized the importance of the decision to have Rittenhouse testify: \"We were very confident that if Kyle testified, the jury would understand the situation. We had conducted mock jury trials to determine that. Ultimately, we made the strategic decision to have Kyle testify, and it paid off.\"\n\nDespite the acquittal, the case remains a contentious issue. Opinions on Rittenhouse and the protests in Kenosha continue to be polarized. The outcome of this trial underscores the complexities of self-defense claims in the context of civil unrest and the importance of a fair and impartial trial."}

Their efforts were met with opposition from Senate Republicans, who cited fiscal concerns and inefficient targeting.\n\n\"The American people are suffering, and Republicans in the Senate refuse to act,\" Schumer said during a press conference. \"We need to support struggling families with the full $2,000 checks that the House has already passed.\"\n\nThe House of Representatives had passed the measure to increase stimulus checks to $2,000 on Monday, following President Trump's urging for the higher amount. Trump, who signed the coronavirus relief bill into law on Sunday, criticized the originally negotiated $600 direct payments as too low.\n\nHowever, Senate Republicans, including Majority Whip John Thune (R-SD) and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), were steadfast in their opposition to the increased amount.\n\n\"We've already provided significant relief to the American people, and it's time for us to focus on getting our economy back on track,\" Thune said in a statement.\n\nMcConnell echoed Thune's sentiments, stating, \"The $2,000 checks are not a serious proposal. We need to focus on getting our economy open and getting Americans back to work.\"\n\nSanders, however, was undeterred. He attempted to call for a vote on the $2,000 checks by proposing a compromise involving McConnell's alternative bill, which would provide additional funding for small businesses. The motion was blocked by GOP Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) on behalf of Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA).\n\n\"This is not a partisan issue,\" Sanders said during a floor speech. \"It's about putting food on the table for struggling families. I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to join us in this effort.\"\n\nHawley, a Republican senator from Missouri, also expressed his frustration over the Senate's inability to vote on the $2,000 checks.

The impasse showed no signs of resolution as the Senate adjourned for the night.\n\nThe failure to pass the $2,000 stimulus checks marks a significant setback for Democrats, who had hoped to deliver much-needed relief to struggling Americans before the end of the year. It also underscores the deep partisan divide in Congress and the challenges of passing legislation during an election year.\n\nSchumer summed up the situation during a press conference late Monday: \"The Republican Senate has once again failed the American people. We will continue to fight for the $2,000 checks that families deserve.\"\n\nAs the Senate adjourned for the night, it was clear that the debate over stimulus checks was far from over. The fate of the $2,000 checks remained uncertain, leaving millions of Americans waiting for relief.\n\nSenate Impasse on $2,000 Stimulus Checks: Schumer, Sanders, and Hawley Press for Increase as GOP Blocks Vote (Continued)\n\nThe lack of progress on the $2,000 stimulus checks came as a disappointment to many Americans who had been hoping for additional financial assistance to help them weather the ongoing economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden weighed in on the issue during a press conference on Monday, expressing his support for the larger checks. \"The American people are hurting, and they need help now,\" Biden said. \"I urge the Senate to act and pass the $2,000 checks as soon as possible.\"\n\nDespite Biden's call for action, it was unclear whether the Senate would be able to reach a compromise on the issue.

In an exclusive interview, Morton discusses the potential reasons behind this unconventional choice.\n\nQuote: \"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's decision not to give Archie a royal title is an intriguing one,\" says Morton. \"There were several factors at play.\"\n\nAccording to Morton, Harry and Meghan had concerns about the title 'Earl of Dumbarton,' which was one of the options on the table. The word 'dumb' in the title, he explains, could have led to bullying.\n\nQuote: \"The concern wasn't about general bullying for being royal,\" Morton clarifies. \"It was specifically about the potential for mockery because of the name 'Dumbarton.'\"\n\nHowever, there is some contention around whether Harry and Meghan had a choice in Archie's titled status.

The couple has long been subject to intense media scrutiny and bullying, which may have influenced their decision.\n\nQuote: \"The decision not to give Archie a royal title can be seen as a reflection of the Sussexes' concern for their public image,\" Morton observes.\n\nAt the same time, the decision could also reflect a parental desire to protect Archie from potential bullying.

While some see it as a reflection of their sensitivity to their public image, others view it as a protective measure for their son. Regardless of the motivations, one thing is clear: the Sussexes are prioritizing their family's well-being above all else.\n\nQuote: \"Ultimately, the Sussexes' decision reflects their commitment to putting their family first,\" Morton concludes. \"It's a choice that speaks volumes about their values and priorities.\""}

The code, designed to support local news media, would impact over 19 million Australian Google users and 17 million Australian Facebook users.\n\nMel Silva, Google's Australian managing director, described the code as untenable and a potential 'dangerous precedent.' In a statement to the Australian Financial Review, Silva said, \"We don't think it's a sustainable model on a global basis. We'd prefer to work collaboratively to support the Australian news industry.\"\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, however, insists Australia makes its own rules and won't respond to threats. Speaking to reporters in Brisbane, Morrison said, \"We make the rules for our country, and we decide what is in the national interest.\"\n\nChris Cooper, Executive Director of Reset Australia, a digital rights advocacy group, criticized Google for behaving like a 'bully' towards the nation. In an interview with the ABC, Cooper stated, \"Google's threat to pull out of Australia is an attempt to bully our elected representatives into doing what they want.\"\n\nJosh Machin, Head of Public Policy for Facebook Australia, claimed limiting news content would not significantly affect the platform since news makes up less than 5% of what users see. Machin told the Sydney Morning Herald, \"We're engaging constructively with the Australian government and regulators about the code.\"\n\nDan Stinton, Managing Director of Guardian Australia, emphasized the importance of the code in a statement to The Guardian, \"The news media bargaining code is an essential step to support Australian journalism in the digital age.\"\n\nRod Sims, Chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), which is overseeing the implementation of the code, emphasized that it promotes fairness in negotiations between digital platforms and news media. Sims told the ABC, \"The code promotes a level playing field and makes sure that the news media get a fair go.\"\n\nMichelle Rowland, Shadow Communications Minister for the Labor Party, expressed concern over the impracticability of the code. In a statement to The Guardian, Rowland said, \"Questions remain about the practicality of the code, particularly the valuation mechanism.\"\n\nAccording to a recent poll conducted by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), a majority of Australians support prioritizing journalism in social media feeds and transparency about algorithm influences. The poll found that 61% of respondents believed social media companies should be required to pay for news content.\n\nGoogle's potential withdrawal from Australia has sparked a global debate on the balance between digital platforms' rights and the need to support local journalism. In an interview with Sky News, European Commission Vice-President Margrethe Vestager stated, \"The Australian code is a unique solution and not a model for the European Commission.\"\n\nSilva reiterated Google's position in a statement to the BBC, \"Google has made a considerable investment in supporting the news industry around the world, providing over $1bn in revenue to publishers each year.\"\n\nMachin acknowledged that Facebook's move could impact smaller publishers disproportionately. He told The Guardian, \"We want to make sure we're not inadvertently impacting smaller publishers.\"\n\nThe Australian government's proposed solution is a mandatory bargaining code, which would force digital platforms to negotiate deals with news media outlets. The code would also establish an independent arbitration process to resolve disputes.\n\nThe Australian News Media Alliance, representing more than 600 publications, has welcomed the code. In a statement released on their website, the alliance stated, \"The code is a critical first step in addressing the bargaining power imbalance between news media businesses and Facebook and Google.\"\n\nSilva further emphasized Google's commitment to the Australian market in her statement to the Australian Financial Review, \"Google is an important part of the Australian economy, with over 5,000 employees and millions of users.\"\n\nFacebook's potential move to limit news content in Australia has been compared to China's censorship of the internet. Cooper told the ABC, \"Google and Facebook's actions are a threat to our democratic values and our right to access information.\"\n\nThe Australian media landscape has undergone significant changes in recent years, with declining revenues and increased competition from digital platforms. The digital news code aims to level the playing field by requiring digital platforms to pay for news content.\n\nThe Australian government's proposed solution has drawn comparisons to similar efforts in other countries, such as Spain and France, which have implemented regulations requiring digital platforms to pay for news content."}

Although Baldwin might not face criminal or civil liability as an actor, his role as a producer may expose him to significant repercussions.\n\nAdam Winkler, a professor at UCLA School of Law and gun policy expert, shared his insights on the legal implications of the shooting. \"As an actor, Baldwin is generally not responsible for the safety of the set,\" Winkler explained. \"However, as a producer, he may have had a duty to ensure crew safety.\"\n\nAccording to Nina Marino, a defense attorney and co-founder of Kaplan Marino law firm, the incident could lead to substantial legal and criminal consequences for Baldwin and other leadership roles on the set. \"The death of Halyna Hutchins is a devastating tragedy, and it will likely result in numerous lawsuits and potential criminal investigations,\" Marino stated.\n\nJulie Shapiro, a law professor and the director of Loyola Law School's Entertainment and Media Law Institute, echoed Winkler's assessment. \"The production company, as well as Baldwin in his capacity as a producer, could be held liable for negligence,\" Shapiro said.\n\nParalleling the legal experts' opinions, Jeff Harris, founding partner of Harris Lowry Manton LLP, emphasized that negligence on the set was a significant concern. \"There is a clear duty to ensure the safety of cast and crew members on a film set,\" Harris stated.\n\nThe fatal shooting occurred when assistant director Dave Halls handed Baldwin a gun, mistakenly declaring it safe. Halls allegedly did not check the gun's chamber before handing it to Baldwin.\n\nWinkler further emphasized the importance of adhering to firearm safety regulations on a film set. \"Film production companies and their leadership have a legal and ethical responsibility to provide a safe working environment,\" Winkler said.\n\nPrevious safety issues and accidental discharges on the \"Rust\" set have raised concerns about negligence. Reports indicate that crew members had complained about safety protocols and the use of prop guns on the set.\n\nRust Movie Productions, the production company behind the film, claimed unawareness of any official safety complaints. In a statement, they pledged to review and upgrade their procedures to prevent such incidents in the future.\n\nLegal professionals, however, doubt criminal charges will be pursued against Baldwin or the production company due to the potential impact on New Mexico's film industry.\n\nAccording to Marino, insurance might cover accidental events but not negligence claims. \"Insurance policies may cover accidental discharges, but they typically do not cover negligence,\" Marino explained.\n\nThe tragedy could prompt safety reforms within the film industry, as experts suggest such incidents are preventable with existing firearm safety regulations.\n\nWinkler highlighted the importance of implementing stricter firearm safety protocols on film sets. \"It is crucial that production companies prioritize the safety of their cast and crew members,\" Winkler stated.\n\nShapiro concurred, emphasizing that effective communication and adherence to safety procedures are essential. \"Clear communication between cast and crew members, as well as strict adherence to safety protocols, can significantly reduce the risk of accidents on a film set,\" Shapiro said.\n\nHarris reiterated the importance of a culture of safety on set. \"The film industry must prioritize safety and create a culture where crew members feel comfortable speaking up about safety concerns,\" Harris emphasized.\n\nMarino warned that the \"Rust\" shooting could set a dangerous precedent if production companies fail to heed the lessons from this tragedy. \"If production companies do not take decisive action to address safety concerns on their sets, they risk further incidents and potential legal repercussions,\" Marino stated.\n\nWinkler also acknowledged the emotional toll on the cast and crew, emphasizing the importance of mental health resources. \"The mental health of cast and crew members is just as important as their physical safety,\" Winkler said."}

Hours before the tragic incident, union members walked off the set, citing poor gun safety among their grievances.\n\nA text message obtained by The New York Post from a member of International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) Local 480, which represents the film's props department, revealed safety concerns as a primary motivation for the walkout. \"We've been dealing with poor working conditions on this set and constantly being ignored,\" the text read.\n\nThe crew's complaints went beyond safety concerns. They also raised issues with the subpar accommodations at the accommodations provided by the production company and inadequate COVID-19 protocols. Several crew members reportedly wrote resignation letters, detailing their reasons for leaving.\n\nDespite the walkout, key members of the crew, including Hutchins, remained on set. She had reportedly been vocal about improving safety conditions, expressing her concerns directly to producers and the production manager. Hutchins' tragic death brought renewed attention to the seriousness of the union members' grievances.\n\nAfter the walkout, non-union crew members were brought in to replace the resigning workers, including the new prop master, Sarah Zachry, who took over just days before the incident. Reports surfaced that the prop gun involved in the fatal shooting had misfired on multiple previous occasions, raising questions about the hiring decision.\n\nThe Santa Fe Police Department has remained tight-lipped about the incident, declining to comment on the specifics of the shooting and the events leading up to it. The lack of transparency has fueled further speculation and concerns about the production's handling of safety protocols.\n\nThe tragic incident on the set of \"Rust\" has sent shockwaves through Hollywood and the film industry at large. The fatal shooting of Halyna Hutchins serves as a grim reminder of the importance of prioritizing safety and addressing workers' concerns on set. As the investigation into the incident continues, the film industry will be closely watching to see what changes, if any, will be made to prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future."}

Chauvin is already facing state murder and manslaughter charges and his trial is set to begin on March 8.\n\nThe federal investigation focuses on Chauvin, but other officers involved in the incident are also being treated as witnesses, according to sources familiar with the matter. Floyd, a Black man, died on May 25, 2020, after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against Floyd's neck for several minutes during an arrest.\n\nFloyd's death sparked nationwide protests and a reckoning on race in the United States. Three other officers involved in the incident – Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng, and Tou Thao – are charged with aiding and abetting Chauvin and are scheduled for trial in August.\n\nThe Justice Department under President Joe Biden is expected to place a greater emphasis on civil rights and policing policies. During his confirmation hearing, Judge Merrick Garland, Biden's nominee for attorney general, pledged to combat racial discrimination in policing.\n\nLast year, former Attorney General William Barr blocked a potential plea deal involving Chauvin, according to The New York Times. With the change in administration, federal prosecutors are now pursuing the civil rights charges.\n\nThe increased grand jury activity may be part of a broader Justice Department strategy under the new administration. Garland has also signaled a renewed focus on investigating police misconduct and other forms of discrimination.\n\nCivil rights charges under federal law carry harsher penalties than state charges. If convicted, Chauvin could face up to life in prison. The state charges carry maximum penalties of 40 years for second-degree murder and 25 years for manslaughter.\n\nFloyd's death was captured on video, showing Chauvin with his knee on Floyd's neck as Floyd repeatedly cried out that he couldn't breathe. The video sparked outrage and led to protests in Minneapolis and around the country.\n\nFloyd's death was one of several high-profile incidents of police brutality against Black Americans that ignited a larger conversation about systemic racism and police reform in the United States. Other incidents, such as the shooting of Jacob Blake in Wisconsin and the death of Breonna Taylor in Kentucky, also received widespread attention.\n\nThe federal grand jury's decision to consider civil rights charges against Chauvin adds another layer to the legal proceedings surrounding Floyd's death and underscores the ongoing national conversation about police reform and racial justice."}

Central to these allegations is Trump's January 6th rallying cry, urging his supporters to \"fight\" before the violent storming of the Capitol.\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD), the lead impeachment manager, stated, \"President Trump's conduct on January 6th was a betrayal of his trust as Commander-in-Chief and a breach of the constitutional duty he swore an oath to fulfill.\"\n\nHowever, the impeachment process is inherently political, not legal, allowing Congress to determine guilt without proving legal culpability. While public opinion appears to be on the side of the impeachment effort, an ABC News/Ipsos poll revealed that 67 percent of Americans believe Trump deserves blame for the riot, and 56 percent want him removed from office before the end of his term.\n\nDespite these findings, legal experts argue that proving Trump's guilt in incitement poses significant challenges. Jeffrey Scott Shapiro, a former District of Columbia assistant attorney general, maintains that Trump's speech is protected under the First Amendment. \"The First Amendment protects speech that incites others to engage in illegal conduct only if the speech is intended to incite imminent lawless action and is likely to incite such action,\" Shapiro explained.\n\nAndrew Koppelman, a constitutional law professor at Northwestern University, concurred, stating, \"It would be difficult to prove that Trump intended for violence to ensue. Incitement requires a clear call to action, and Trump did not explicitly tell his supporters to storm the Capitol.\"\n\nDespite these obstacles, some Democrats have advocated for legal action against Trump post-presidency. However, Biden, who has prioritized unity and healing in the wake of the riot, seems focused on other issues. In a recent press conference, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki stated, \"The president's focus is on his agenda for the American people.\"\n\nAs the impeachment trial unfolds, the debate over Trump's role in the Capitol riot will continue to raise complex constitutional questions and test the boundaries of the democratic process.\n\nRep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), the House Judiciary Committee chairman, emphasized the gravity of the situation, stating, \"If this behavior is not held accountable, we will witness more of it in the future.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Trump's legal team has argued that the impeachment trial is unconstitutional since he is no longer in office. In response, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi argued that the impeachment process serves as a safeguard against future presidential misconduct, ensuring that the US government remains accountable to its citizens.\n\nThroughout the trial, legal experts, political pundits, and the American public will closely scrutinize the arguments presented by both sides as they grapple with the constitutional implications of impeaching a former president.\n\nIn closing remarks, Rep. Raskin reiterated the gravity of the situation, stating, \"We are here to defend the Constitution and uphold the rule of law. The future of our democracy depends on it.\"\n\nAs the debate over Trump's role in the Capitol riot continues, the constitutional questions raised by this historic impeachment trial will undoubtedly shape the political discourse for years to come."}

The research, which analyzed tweets from elected officials in seven countries and political content from major U.S. news organizations like Fox News, the New York Times, and BuzzFeed, revealed significant discrepancies in amplification between right-leaning and left-leaning content in six out of seven countries.\n\nRumman Chowdhury, Twitter's Director of Software Engineering, acknowledged the findings and emphasized the need for further investigation. \"Our research shows that there is a discrepancy in the amplification of political content between right-leaning and left-leaning sources on Twitter,\" Chowdhury said in a statement. \"We need to understand why this is the case and are committed to being transparent and accountable to our users.\"\n\nThe study, conducted by Luca Belli, a researcher at Twitter, found that the algorithmic \"Home\" timeline led to more amplification of political tweets than the chronological timeline, exacerbating the discrepancy. In Canada and the UK, the discrepancies were particularly significant, with right-leaning tweets being amplified 2.5 times more than left-leaning tweets in Canada and 2.3 times more in the UK.\n\nTwitter expressed uncertainty as to why its algorithm produced these results and suggested potential changes might be necessary. \"We are unclear as to why our algorithm is amplifying right-leaning content more than left-leaning content,\" Chowdhury said. \"However, we believe that our algorithm may need adjustments to ensure fairness and impartiality.\"\n\nBoth Chowdhury and Belli emphasized the importance of continued analysis and potential adjustments to the algorithm. \"It is crucial that we continue to investigate these discrepancies and work towards addressing any biases in our algorithm,\" Belli said.\n\nIn response to the study's findings, Twitter announced plans to make its research available to external researchers and is preparing to allow broader access to its data. The move is seen as putting pressure on Facebook to also share research, especially in light of recent controversies surrounding the platform's handling of misinformation and political content.\n\nTwitter aims to balance privacy and accountability in its approach to algorithmic transparency. \"We understand the importance of maintaining user privacy while being transparent and accountable,\" Chowdhury said. \"Our machine-learning ethics, transparency, and accountability team is finalizing plans for regular data sharing with external sources.\"\n\nThe study's findings add to growing concerns over the role of social media algorithms in shaping public discourse and reinforcing political echo chambers. As the debate around algorithmic transparency and accountability continues, platforms like Twitter and Facebook are under increasing pressure to address these issues and ensure fairness and impartiality in their algorithms."}

One of the most notable changes post-verdict has been the reversal of GoFundMe's ban on contributions to Rittenhouse's defense fund.\n\nHowever, the victory for Rittenhouse has come at a cost for others. Norfolk Police Officer William Kelly, who anonymously donated to Rittenhouse's defense and expressed his support, was recently terminated from his position with the Norfolk Police Department.\n\nDespite significant changes in public perception following the verdict, Norfolk City Manager Chip Filer and Police Chief Larry Boone have retained their positions, leading many to question the fairness and implications of Kelly's firing.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Kelly's termination has shed light on the financial pressures defendants face and the role of crowdfunding platforms like GoFundMe in providing access to legal defense funds.\n\nActivists had previously targeted Rittenhouse's defense fund, successfully pressuring GoFundMe to block contributions. Now, the pendulum has swung in the opposite direction, raising questions about the inconsistency and potential bias in these decisions.\n\nOfficer Kelly, with nearly 20 years of service, was terminated after his anonymous donation and comment supporting Rittenhouse were exposed. Despite the public outcry and ongoing appeals against the firing, Kelly faces continued unemployment and financial hardship.\n\nThis situation raises concerns about the broader trend of intolerance for free speech and association rights in the private lives of public employees. Comparisons can be drawn to public officials' contributions to funds like the Minnesota Freedom Fund, which garnered widespread support and no repercussions.\n\nKelly's right to support Rittenhouse's defense should be seen as no different from the right of elected officials to support causes they believe in. The line between public and private spheres is becoming increasingly blurred, and the consequences for exercising these fundamental rights must be carefully considered.\n\nAccess to a fair trial is a cornerstone of our justice system, and contributions to legal defense funds play a crucial role in ensuring this access. The case of Officer William Kelly serves as a reminder of the importance of these funds and the potential repercussions for those who seek to support them.\n\nThe disparity in the treatment of free speech rights between Kelly and public officials who endorse causes like Black Lives Matter protests is a troubling development. This inconsistency highlights the need for a more nuanced and balanced approach to these issues.\n\nFurthermore, the potential chilling effect on free speech and association rights for public employees could have far-reaching implications, stifling open discourse and debate within the ranks of law enforcement and other public sectors.\n\nIt is essential that we as a society recognize the importance of upholding the principles of free speech and association, even in the face of polarizing issues. The case of Officer William Kelly underscores the need for a more thoughtful and balanced approach to these complex issues.\n\nMoreover, the firing of Officer Kelly sets a dangerous precedent, potentially discouraging other public employees from expressing their opinions or supporting causes they believe in, even anonymously.\n\nAs we continue to grapple with the complexities of these issues, it is crucial that we remain committed to the principles of free speech and association, recognizing the importance of these fundamental rights in fostering an open and democratic society. Officer William Kelly's situation serves as a reminder of the potential consequences of failing to do so."}

Furman of the Southern District of New York denied Citigroup Inc.'s (Citi) bid to recover over $500 million mistakenly wired to Revlon lenders in August 2022, allowing the recipients to keep the funds because they discharged valid debts and weren't aware of Citi's mistake (Revlon LLC et al. v Citibank, N.A. et al., 1:22-cv-07783).\n\nA Citi spokesperson stated, \"We strongly disagree with the court's decision and plan to appeal\" (The Wall Street Journal, November 16, 2022).\n\nThe decision was based on a specific exception in New York law concerning mistaken wire transfers. Revlon's lenders argued that the funds were a valid satisfaction of their debts. The overpayment was intended to be a much smaller interest payment of approximately $7.8 million instead of the $893 million actually sent. Some lenders had returned part of the overpayment, but the incident led to numerous lawsuits.\n\nAccording to Judge Furman's ruling, \"In this case, the mistake was massive, and the circumstances were such that, even if the funds had been returned, it would be inequitable to permit Citi to recover them. The lenders did not know of the error, acted in good faith, and discharged valid debts.\"\n\nCiti's shares were up 0.7% following the news of the court ruling, reflecting some relief among investors. Nevertheless, the wire transfer mistake in August has heightened regulatory scrutiny over Citigroup's internal practices.\n\nIn October 2022, Citigroup was fined $400 million by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) for risk management, data governance, and internal controls deficiencies, unrelated to the wire transfer incident (The New York Times, October 13, 2022).\n\nJudge Furman also noted the unlikelihood and unprecedented nature of such a massive banking error in his ruling, stating, \"It is unclear how an error of this magnitude could occur, and it is unlikely that it will happen again\" (Revlon LLC et al. v Citibank, N.A. et al., 1:22-cv-07783).\n\nThe ruling brings clarity to a contentious issue in the banking world, establishing a precedent for future cases involving mistaken wire transfers.

ERCOT and the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC) faced intense criticism for their handling of the situation, with many questioning why they had not adequately prepared for severe winter conditions.\n\nAccording to ERCOT's fall projections, the maximum power demand and available power generation for severe winter conditions were both overestimated. This led to widespread power outages as the demand for electricity surged during the storm.\n\nLt. Gov. Dan Patrick called for the resignations of Magness and DeAnn Walker, head of the PUC, in the aftermath of the crisis. Gov. Greg Abbott, meanwhile, has called for reforms in ERCOT's governance to prevent future power failures.\n\nThe crisis has put pressure on Texas lawmakers to pass legislation to address the state's energy needs. With Texas expected to experience a hotter and drier summer than normal, increasing demands on the power grid, the need for action is urgent.\n\nMagness' departure comes after a tumultuous few months for ERCOT. The winter storm was not the first time the grid operator faced criticism for its handling of extreme weather events. In 2011, ERCOT came under fire for its response to a heat wave that left thousands without power.\n\nJones brings significant experience to the role, having previously served as president and CEO of the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) from 2014 to 2018. During his tenure at NYISO, he oversaw the implementation of market reforms and the integration of renewable energy sources into the grid.\n\nERCOT's board of directors announced Jones' appointment in a statement, expressing confidence in his ability to lead the organization through this challenging time. \"Brad's extensive experience in the energy industry and his proven track record of success make him the ideal candidate to lead ERCOT during this critical period,\" the statement read.\n\nAs Jones takes up his new role, he faces the daunting task of rebuilding trust in ERCOT and implementing reforms to prevent future power failures. The crisis has highlighted the need for significant investment in the state's energy infrastructure and a more robust response to extreme weather events.\n\nThe full extent of the damage caused by the winter storm is still being assessed, but one thing is clear: Texas cannot afford another power failure. With Jones at the helm, ERCOT will be under intense scrutiny as it works to prevent future crises and ensure the reliability of the state's power grid.\n\nDespite the challenges ahead, Jones remains optimistic about the future. \"I am committed to working with stakeholders across the state to ensure that ERCOT is well-positioned to meet the energy needs of Texans now and in the future,\" he said in a statement. \"Together, we will build a more resilient and reliable power grid that Texans can count on, no matter what the weather brings.\""}

Dorsey shared his vision during an interview at the \"Digital:Africa\" conference, emphasizing the need for an open and decentralized standard for social media platforms. \"The internet is not decentralized, social media is not decentralized, and we believe it needs to be,\" Dorsey stated.\n\nTo combat online abuse and misinformation, Dorsey's vision includes the development of an open and decentralized standard for social media named Bluesky. He believes this approach will help create a healthier online environment, giving users more power to shape their own experiences. \"The goal is a decentralized standard for social media,\" Dorsey explained. \"It's a long-term, 10-plus-year vision. It's going to take a lot of time and resources.\"\n\nTwitter is already experimenting with this vision through initiatives like Birdwatch, a forum for users to identify and discuss misleading tweets. Dorsey emphasized the importance of community involvement, stating, \"We're working on a project called Birdwatch, where we're training a group of thousands of Twitter users to identify accurate information and rate the reasonableness of claims. We are also testing this feature publicly.\"\n\nDorsey also discussed broadening Twitter's functions beyond tweets, including features like Fleets, Spaces, and the acquisition of newsletter platform Revue. He mentioned the potential role of Twitter in recruitment, stating, \"We're also exploring Twitter as a recruiting platform. We've seen a lot of use cases for it. It's a big opportunity.\" Dorsey added, \"We're always thinking about what's the next evolution of Twitter.\"\n\nRegarding content moderation, Dorsey emphasized the need for more transparency and the potential impacts of changing Section 230 on online content liability. He stated, \"We need more transparency around our moderation decisions. It's crucial that we're clear about the actions we take. We also need to be mindful of the potential impacts on Section 230. It's a complex issue.\"\n\nTwitter's labeling of misinformation and banning of former President Donald Trump has led some users to seek alternative platforms. Dorsey acknowledged this, stating, \"We've seen some users leave the platform because they don't agree with our policies. That's their right, and we respect their decision. But we believe in the importance of the conversation happening on Twitter.\"\n\nPlans for decentralizing social media include offering users a choice of algorithms to curate their experience and allowing third-party algorithm development. Dorsey explained, \"We're exploring ways to give users more control over their Twitter experience, including the ability to choose different algorithms for curating their feeds. We're also considering allowing third-party algorithm development.\"\n\nFinally, Dorsey aims to focus on economic incentives for contributors to Twitter, studying various subscription model ideas. He stated, \"We're exploring different ways to monetize Twitter beyond advertising, including subscription services for TweetDeck and possibly for exclusive content or ad-free feeds. We believe in the importance of economic incentives for contributors to the platform.\" Dorsey concluded, \"Our mission is to serve the public conversation, and we're committed to finding new ways to do that in a decentralized, open, and transparent manner.\""}

The tragic shooting at Oxford High School in Michigan, which left four students dead and seven others injured, has set off a wave of apprehension, with over 150 threats reported nationwide in the week following the incident.\n\nKara Grasser, a spokeswoman for the Montgomery County Public Schools in Maryland, described the current climate as \"a challenge,\" stating, \"We take every threat seriously, but we don't want to create unnecessary fear or disruption for students and families.\"\n\nAs school administrators grapple with the dilemma of closing schools or keeping them open amid these threats, some districts have opted for virtual learning, while others have implemented lockdown protocols. James Densley, a professor of criminal justice at Metropolitan State University in Minnesota, explained, \"There's a fine line between being overly cautious and disrupting the educational process.\"\n\nJason Enix, superintendent of the Reading Community City School District in Pennsylvania, emphasized the importance of taking every threat seriously, stating, \"We would rather err on the side of caution, even if it means an occasional false alarm.\" In contrast, Daniel McGarry, superintendent of the Upper Darby School District in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, opted for virtual learning in response to a social media threat, explaining, \"We can't put our students and staff at risk, no matter how much it disrupts the learning process.\"\n\nLaurel Thompson, a board member of the School Social Work Association of America, expressed concerns over the repercussions of frequent school closures on students' mental health, stating, \"The pandemic has already caused significant disruptions to students' learning and emotional well-being. The constant threat of school closures due to social media threats only adds to the stress.\"\n\nAmy Klinger, founder and director of the Educator's School Safety Network, a nonprofit organization that provides school safety resources, warned of the potential for fake threats and accounts, stating, \"It's not just about identifying genuine threats, but also sorting through the noise created by hoaxes and misinformation.\"\n\nSome threats have been linked to students' mental health issues exacerbated by the pandemic. Grasser noted, \"We've seen an increase in threats made by students who are struggling with mental health issues. It's a complex issue that requires a multifaceted response.\"\n\nIn some cases, detailed investigations into threats have led to arrests and charges. For example, in New Jersey, a 15-year-old student was charged with making terroristic threats after posting a threat on social media. In Ohio, a 17-year-old student was arrested for threatening to shoot up a high school.\n\nLegislation is being proposed at the federal and state levels to increase funding for school support personnel, such as counselors, social workers, and school resource officers. Densley stated, \"We need to invest in the resources and personnel that can help identify and address the root causes of these threats before they escalate.\"\n\nGrasser concluded, \"It's a difficult time for schools, but we're doing everything we can to keep our students safe while minimizing disruptions to their education.\" Thompson added, \"We need to work together as a community to support our students and ensure they have the resources they need to thrive, both academically and emotionally.\""}

Morris, Michigan, may have saved lives during last week's shooting spree. According to reports, the alleged shooter entered the school through an exterior door that was locked with one of these devices.\n\nMichael Bouchard, Oakland County Sheriff, acknowledged the effectiveness of the school's safety precautions and training protocols. \"The fact that the shooter did not enter any classrooms is a testament to the Oxford Community Schools' commitment to student safety,\" he stated.\n\nNightlock's locking devices, which feature a red handle that can be inserted into the door from a wall-mounted box, preventing entry, have been sold to approximately 10,000 school districts nationwide. Cris Ahearn, Director of Sales at Nightlock, expressed emotional distress over the incident. \"Our locks are designed to keep doors secured even if the glass is broken and someone tries to unlock the door from the outside. But we cannot ignore the limitations of locking devices in protecting individuals in hallways,\" he shared.\n\nAt Oxford High School, a variety of these locks were installed in 2017, suitable for both inward and outward swinging doors. The incident led to increased inquiries from districts seeking to enhance their facility security. \"We are working around the clock to provide our devices to as many schools as possible,\" Ahearn added.\n\nNightlock's creation was initially inspired by a home invasion at the owners' parents' house. Following the Sandy Hook shooting in 2012, the company pivoted its focus towards developing school security devices. \"Our mission is to provide peace of mind to students, educators, and parents. We take our responsibility seriously,\" Ahearn emphasized.\n\nBouchard further praised the school's response, stating, \"The lockdown procedures were executed flawlessly. The fact that no students were harmed inside classrooms is a clear indication of the effectiveness of the school's safety measures.\"\n\nDespite the positive outcome, Ahearn could not help but feel the weight of the situation. \"Our thoughts are with the families affected by this tragedy. We will continue to work tirelessly to provide the best security solutions for our schools,\" he concluded.\n\nIn the aftermath of the shooting, Oxford Community Schools released a statement thanking the first responders and expressing their gratitude for the community's support. \"We remain committed to the safety and well-being of our students and staff,\" the statement read.\n\nAs the investigation into the shooting continues, the importance of school safety measures remains at the forefront of the national conversation. Nightlock, along with other security providers, will continue to play a crucial role in ensuring the safety of students across the country."}

The cause of the fire was not immediately clear, but smoke from the blaze was visible from the Capitol complex.\n\nOfficials stressed that there was no threat to the public or the inauguration from the fire. Acting Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman ordered the evacuation and lockdown as a precautionary measure.\n\nPresident-elect Biden was not present at the rehearsal during the lockdown. Instead, he spent the day at the Willard InterContinental Hotel in downtown Washington, DC, preparing for his inauguration ceremony.\n\nHeightened security measures have been in place around the Capitol since the January 6 riot, when a mob of Trump supporters stormed the complex, leading to the deaths of five people and injuring over 140 police officers.\n\nAs a result, the area has been on high alert and lockdown, with National Guard troops and other law enforcement agencies stationed throughout the city.\n\nParticipants of the inauguration rehearsal, including a military band, were directed to move to a secure location inside the Capitol complex. The lockdown caused delays and disruptions to the rehearsal schedule.\n\nThe US Secret Service announced on Twitter that the lockdown was a precautionary measure, confirming there was no public threat. \"There is no threat to public safety at this time,\" the agency tweeted.\n\nThe fire department extinguished the fire near the Capitol, confirming there were no injuries. The source of the smoke was later identified as a small fire in a tent in the homeless encampment.\n\nDespite the incident, the rehearsal resumed later in the day, with Biden's team expressing confidence that the inauguration would proceed smoothly on January 20.

President Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama, among many others, heralded the decision as a step towards accountability and justice. However, for many, the conviction of Chauvin was not seen as a victory, but rather a mere acknowledgment of the brutality that has long been inflicted upon Black communities.\n\nThe belief that police reforms can eradicate racial bias and bring about meaningful change is a naive one. The truth is that policing, at its very core, is a system of racial and economic control. Even in the absence of explicit racial bias, policing cannot and will not solve the problems of inequality and exploitation that plague our society. The criminal justice system, which includes policing, has been used historically to enforce racial hierarchies and perpetuate systemic oppression.\n\nThe low rate of police convictions, despite numerous killings by law enforcement, is a testament to the broad leeway that officers are granted under the law to use force. The fact that Derek Chauvin was convicted is an anomaly, and does little to change the fact that countless other cases of police brutality have gone unpunished. Convictions provide relief only for the living and do not save lives. They do not address the root causes of violence and inequality in our communities.\n\nThe same day that the Chauvin verdict was handed down, a white police officer in Columbus, Ohio, shot and killed a 15-year-old Black girl named Ma'Khia Bryant. Her death is a stark reminder of the ongoing issues with police violence and the lack of justice for victims. The Chauvin trial was only one instance in a long line of police killings that have gone unchecked and unpunished. It is clear that convictions alone are not enough to bring about meaningful change.\n\nAs we reflect on the Chauvin verdict and its implications, it is essential to recognize that police abolition, not just reform, is necessary for societal change. This does not mean that we should dismantle law enforcement entirely, but rather that we must rethink the role that police play in our communities and explore alternative approaches to public safety. We must support social movements and organizations that are pushing for transformational change and invest in community-led initiatives that prioritize prevention and healing over punishment and retribution. The fight for justice and accountability is far from over, but it is a fight worth having."}

Drafted 199th overall in the 2000 NFL Draft, Brady has etched his name into football lore, leaving statisticians and experts in awe.\n\nVince Jansen, a renowned stats whiz, likens Brady's achievement to winning the Powerball jackpot multiple times. \"The odds of a given player winning seven or more Super Bowls are comparable to winning the Powerball jackpot with five or six tickets,\" Jansen explained. Based on the Pro Football Reference database, the observed probability of this accomplishment is 1 in 26,683.\n\nThomas Severini, a statistics professor at Northwestern University, elaborates on the rarity of Brady's achievement. \"Given that there were 253 players drafted in the 2000 NFL Draft, the theoretical probability of a random player from that draft winning at least seven Super Bowls is roughly 1 in 51.8 million,\" Severini calculated.\n\nMark Glickman, a statistics professor at Harvard, adds, \"The probability for a player with a guaranteed 21-year career to win seven or more Super Bowls is 1 in 435,119.\" And when narrowing the focus solely on quarterbacks, the probability improves marginally to 1 in 12.8 million.\n\nHowever, the assumption used in these calculations is that a player's Super Bowl odds in a given season are 1/32. Abraham Wyner, a stats professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, points out that this isn't entirely realistic. \"In reality, the odds of a team winning a Super Bowl in a given season are closer to 1 in 10,\" Wyner noted. \"So, the actual probability of a player winning seven or more Super Bowls is likely even lower than our calculations suggest.\"\n\nDespite these seemingly insurmountable odds, experts believe that another player may eventually join Brady's exclusive club. Estimations suggest that the probability of another player winning seven Super Bowls by 2075 is around 0.01%. Regardless, the consensus remains that Brady's seven championships are considered one of the top five most improbable feats in sports history.\n\n\"Tom Brady's accomplishments on the football field are a testament to his talent, dedication, and resilience,\" Severini said. \"But when you look at the numbers, it's clear that what he's achieved is nothing short of astronomical.\"\n\nGlickman adds, \"Tom Brady's story is a reminder that, in sports as in life, the impossible can sometimes become a reality. But the odds are heavily stacked against it.\"\n\nJansen concludes, \"Tom Brady's seven Super Bowl wins are a statistical anomaly. It's an achievement that, based on the numbers, should never have happened. But it did. And that's what makes Tom Brady's story so extraordinary.\""}

While Rumsfeld died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 88, the same cannot be said for the hundreds of thousands of lives lost due to the wars he launched and the civilian casualties his strategies inflicted.\n\nRumsfeld, a key neoconservative architect of the Bush administration's post-9/11 war efforts, leaves behind a complicated legacy. His strategies led to devastating consequences, particularly in Afghanistan, where the U.S. military actions resulted in high civilian casualties. One of the most egregious examples of this came in the form of cluster bombs, which the U.S. used inadvertently endangered civilians. Rumsfeld's Pentagon was also criticized for keeping journalists away from the frontlines and controlling information.\n\nThe invasion of Iraq, where Rumsfeld played a pivotal role, remains a defining chapter in his controversial career. With 9/11 used as justification for targeting Iraq, Rumsfeld's long-standing interest in regime change in the country came to the forefront. Years before the Iraq War, Rumsfeld had previously interacted with Saddam Hussein in the 1980s, providing him with arms and intelligence to support Iraq against Iran. However, as the world now knows, these past dealings came back to haunt Rumsfeld when his support for Saddam Hussein was highlighted during the Iraq War preparations.\n\nDespite the controversies and criticisms, Rumsfeld remained a defining figure in U.S. military and foreign policy. His legacy serves as a stark reminder of the human cost of war and the dangers of unchecked military interventionism. While Rumsfeld may be gone, the lessons of his policies and their consequences will continue to reverberate through history. It is incumbent upon us to learn from these lessons and strive for a more just and peaceful world."}

The charges against Chauvin are separate from those related to Floyd's death.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Chauvin is accused of striking the teenager with a flashlight and kneeling on his neck and back during an encounter in September 2017. The three-count indictment alleges that Chauvin deprived the teenager and Floyd of their constitutional rights to be free from unreasonable force by a police officer.\n\nChauvin, along with three other former officers – Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng, and Tou Thao – also pleaded not guilty to federal civil rights charges stemming from Floyd's death. The indictment accuses the officers of failing to intervene in Chauvin's use of force and failing to give Floyd medical aid.\n\nFloyd's death, which occurred on May 25, 2020, led to widespread protests against police brutality and racial injustice. Chauvin was convicted of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd's death on April 20, 2021.\n\nChauvin's trial for the 14-year-old's case is scheduled for December 12, 2021. The state charges for aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter against Thao, Kueng, and Lane in Floyd's death remain ongoing.\n\nThe federal charges against Chauvin and the other officers carry potential penalties of up to life in prison and fines up to $250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for organizations.\n\nChauvin's attorney, Marmar J. Coleman, declined to comment on the indictment related to the 14-year-old. In a statement to CNN, Coleman emphasized that Chauvin maintains his innocence in both cases.\n\n\"Mr. Chauvin maintains his innocence in both the George Floyd and the 14-year-old cases and intends to fight both cases in court,\" Coleman stated.\n\nThe Justice Department launched investigations into Floyd's death and the incident involving the 14-year-old boy following public outcry over police brutality and racial disparities in law enforcement.\n\nThe investigations are part of the department's broader effort to address systemic issues within law enforcement agencies and hold officers accountable for violating the constitutional rights of citizens.\n\nThe federal charges against Chauvin and the other officers mark a significant step in the ongoing effort to bring justice for Floyd and the 14-year-old boy, as well as other victims of police brutality.\n\nThe cases against Chauvin and the other officers will undoubtedly be closely watched by advocacy groups, legal experts, and the public as they move forward in the legal system.\n\nAs the legal proceedings continue, the focus on police reform and accountability remains at the forefront of national conversations, with many hoping that the outcomes of these cases will lead to meaningful change in law enforcement practices and policies."}

The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan issued a statement condemning the bombing and reported a death toll of 30.\n\nThe Islamic State considers Shiite Muslims heretics and often targets their places of worship. The attack in Kandahar underscores fears that the Taliban, now controlling the entire country, is unable to control other militant groups, including Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State.\n\nAbdul Jabar Karimi, an eyewitness to the attack, described the scene as chaotic. \"There were multiple explosions and gunfire,\" he said. \"People were running for their lives. It was a terrible sight.\"\n\nMurtaza Khaledi, another eyewitness, echoed Karimi's account. \"The mosque was filled with people for prayers,\" he said. \"Suddenly, there was a loud explosion, followed by gunfire. People were screaming and running for cover.\"\n\nThe Taliban faces pressure to maintain security nationwide as the international community watches closely to see if they will uphold their promises to prevent terrorist groups from operating in Afghanistan. The bombing in Kandahar comes just a day after a Taliban police chief was killed by the Islamic State in Konar province.\n\nThe Taliban has promised to create a peaceful and stable Afghanistan, but the resurgence of militant groups threatens to undermine their efforts. The international community has expressed concerns about the Taliban's ability to govern and maintain security in a country with a long history of conflict.\n\nDespite these challenges, the Taliban remains committed to establishing a new government and rebuilding the country. They have promised to provide amnesty to those who worked with the previous government and to respect the rights of all Afghans, regardless of their ethnic or religious background.\n\nThe international community, including the United States, has pledged to provide humanitarian aid to Afghanistan, but it remains to be seen how much assistance the Taliban will accept and how it will be distributed. The Taliban has also called for international recognition and assistance in rebuilding the country's infrastructure and economy.\n\nAs Afghanistan begins this new chapter in its history, the challenges are many, but so too are the opportunities. The international community must work with the Taliban to ensure that the rights of all Afghans are protected and that the country is not once again plunged into conflict.\n\nThe bombing in Kandahar is a stark reminder of the challenges that lie ahead, but it is also an opportunity for the Taliban to demonstrate their commitment to creating a peaceful and stable Afghanistan. Only time will tell if they are up to the task."}

The post, which led to wide condemnation from the public on social media, was shared on the department's official page late last week.\n\nFall River Police Chief Jeffrey Cardoza issued a statement on Saturday, saying, \"I want to make it clear that this post does not reflect the values of the Fall River Police Department or its members.

Ken Calvert, the bomber, identified as Abdul Rehman Al-Loghri, was among the several prisoners released when the Taliban took control of Parwan prison at Bagram air base and Pul-e-Charkhi prison near Kabul. The Taliban seizure of these prisons during the chaotic final days of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan highlighted the struggle to secure the Kabul airport's perimeter.\n\nCalvert, in a statement, criticized the handling of the withdrawal and its connection to the events leading to the airport attack. \"The administration's hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan and abandonment of Bagram Airfield put our servicemembers, Afghan allies, and innocent civilians at risk,\" Calvert said.\n\nGen. Mark Milley, Joint Chiefs Chairman, warned of the potential reconstitution of al Qaeda or ISIS-K within 6 to 36 months, emphasizing the need for continued vigilance. Milley stated, \"We know that terrorist organizations like al Qaeda and ISIS-K will seek to reconstitute, and we are taking steps to prevent that.\"\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin defended the decision to leave Bagram, emphasizing the focus on protecting the US embassy in Kabul. \"Our priority was to secure the US embassy and ensure the safe and orderly drawdown of our civilian personnel and military forces,\" Austin said.\n\nAt the time of the handover, officials estimated 5,000 prisoners at Bagram, the majority of whom were identified as terrorists. The rapid fall of Afghan districts and eventual control of Kabul by the Taliban was accelerated by the US withdrawal.\n\nCalvert further criticized the Biden administration's coordination with Afghan authorities, stating, \"The administration's abandonment of our Afghan allies and failure to adequately coordinate with Afghan security forces left a vacuum that the Taliban were all too eager to fill.\"\n\nThe US Embassy in Kabul issued a statement expressing condolences to the families of the 13 US service members and dozens of Afghans killed in the attack. \"We are committed to ensuring that those responsible for this heinous attack are held accountable,\" the statement read."}

As of May 12, over 165 million payments, totaling approximately $388 billion, have been distributed, according to IRS data.\n\nCharlie Wise, head of global research and consulting at TransUnion, shared his insights on the economic impact of these payments: \"Stimulus checks play a crucial role in helping families stay afloat during these challenging times. The direct financial assistance not only bolsters consumer confidence but also helps support local businesses and the overall economy.\"\n\nThe IRS has prioritized individuals who filed their 2019 or 2020 tax returns and has vetted payment data for government benefit recipients, including Social Security beneficiaries. Moreover, more than 460,000 \"plus-up\" payments were sent to individuals who were initially underpaid, and another 500,000 payments were issued to recent tax filers.\n\nHalf of the new payments were sent via direct deposit, while the other half were distributed through mail via checks or pre-paid debit cards. Direct deposits typically reach recipients faster, but those receiving paper checks or pre-paid debit cards might have to wait longer for their payments.\n\nAs 38% of Americans report their household income remains impacted by the pandemic, lawmakers are considering a fourth round of stimulus payments. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.) recently stated, \"The American people need more relief, and I believe another round of direct payments is essential to help families weather this ongoing crisis.\"\n\nFor those eagerly awaiting their payments, the IRS reopened the \"Get My Payment\" website for tracking the status of $1,400 checks. Various statuses are displayed, ranging from processed payments to those needing more information.\n\nIssues like unchanged addresses or bank information can affect payment delivery, but the IRS encourages filers to update their information on their 2020 tax returns. Pre-paid debit cards for stimulus payments will not be reloaded; a new card or alternative payment method will be issued for any future payments.\n\nIRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig stated, \"The IRS is working tirelessly to distribute stimulus payments as quickly and efficiently as possible. We urge anyone who has not yet received their payment to check the status on our 'Get My Payment' website and to file their 2020 tax return with their current banking information.\"\n\nReturned funds due to incorrect bank account information will lead to a mailed check or pre-paid debit card. The IRS assures that no funds are lost; they are simply being rerouted to the correct recipients.\n\nWise shared his perspective on the potential impact of the fourth round of stimulus payments: \"Another round of direct payments would provide much-needed relief to families and help sustain economic growth. However, it's crucial that the IRS continues to prioritize accuracy and efficiency to minimize delays and ensure that those who need the assistance receive it as soon as possible.\""}

The President recalled his early call for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to gain access to China and collaborate with their counterparts to study the virus in its early stages.

The vessel had run aground due to a loss of steering capability amid high winds and a dust storm, causing a major disruption to international trade.\n\nAccording to Jamil Sayegh, a former captain and maritime law specialist, \"The Suez Canal is a critical artery for global trade, and this incident highlights its importance.\" The Ever Given, with a length of 400 meters and a width of 59 meters, had blocked a crucial lane in the canal since March 23.\n\nEight tugboats were deployed to free the vessel, which was carrying around 20,000 containers, according to Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, the ship's technical manager. All crew members were reportedly safe.\n\nPeter Sand, the chief shipping analyst at the Baltic and International Maritime Council (Bimco), stated, \"About 50 ships a day pass through the Suez Canal, and this blockage has caused significant delays and disruptions to Asia-Europe trade.\"\n\nLars Jensen, the chief executive of SeaIntelligence Consulting, added, \"The knock-on effects of this incident could be felt for months, with ships having to take longer routes around Africa to reach their destinations.\"\n\nStrong winds are believed to have caused the Ever Given to veer off course and run aground, but human error and the necessity of not delaying shipments might have also contributed to the accident.\n\nJamil Sayegh explained, \"High winds can turn the containers into a vast sail, making it challenging to maintain control of a large vessel like the Ever Given.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a growing number of tankers, carrying millions of barrels of crude oil, were waiting to pass through the canal.\n\nPeter Sand noted, \"The blockage in the Suez Canal is having a ripple effect on global oil prices, with the price of Brent crude oil reaching its highest level since 2019.\"\n\nLars Jensen added, \"The delays caused by the Ever Given's grounding could result in significant financial losses for shipping companies and their clients.\"\n\nJamil Sayegh emphasized the importance of the Suez Canal, stating, \"The Suez Canal is a vital link between Europe and Asia, and any disruption to its operations can have far-reaching consequences.\"\n\nThe Ever Given incident was not the first major disruption to shipping in the Suez Canal. In 2017, a Japanese container ship, the Evergreen Mariner, ran aground, and in 2016, the CSCL Indian Ocean near Hamburg also experienced difficulties.\n\nDespite the challenges, efforts to refloat the Ever Given continued, with dredgers pumping thousands of cubic meters of sand from the canal to free the vessel.\n\nPeter Sand commented, \"The successful refloating of the Ever Given is a relief for the global shipping industry, but the long-term consequences of this incident remain to be seen.\"\n\nLars Jensen added, \"The Ever Given incident underscores the importance of investing in technology and infrastructure to improve the safety and efficiency of global shipping.\"\n\nJamil Sayegh emphasized the role of human error in maritime incidents, stating, \"Despite advances in technology, human error remains a significant factor in maritime accidents.\"\n\nPeter Sand noted, \"The successful refloating of the Ever Given is a reminder of the importance of international cooperation and collaboration in resolving maritime crises.\"\n\nLars Jensen concluded, \"The Ever Given incident is a wake-up call for the shipping industry to focus on safety, efficiency, and sustainability to mitigate the risks and challenges of global shipping.\"\n\nAs the Ever Given continued its journey through the Suez Canal, the maritime community breathed a collective sigh of relief, aware that the incident had underscored the importance of the Suez Canal as an international trade artery and the need for ongoing efforts to ensure the safety and efficiency of global shipping."}

According to Canton Police Chief Chad Baugh, the student who made the report was not able to provide a detailed description of the suspect or the weapon.\n\nAcelino Villarini, a sophomore at Canton High School, described the chaos that ensued, \"We heard sirens outside and were told to stay in our classrooms. I saw some students preparing to defend themselves, using desks and chairs as makeshift weapons. It was a scary situation.\"\n\nLarry Pado, a parent of a freshman at Salem High School, expressed his concern, \"I was terrified when I heard about the situation. The recent shooting at Oxford High School is still fresh in everyone's mind. I just want my child to be safe.\"\n\nTyler Bond, a senior at Plymouth High School, added, \"It's frustrating that this keeps happening. We should be able to learn in a safe environment without having to worry about our safety.\"\n\nDespite the initial alarm, Chief Baugh confirmed that everyone is safe and no injuries were reported. No one was taken into custody, and no weapons were found. However, the investigation continues with analysis of surveillance footage.\n\nMarie Castle, a parent of a sophomore at Canton High School, commented on the impact of the incident on her child, \"She's shaken up. She doesn't want to go back to school until she feels safe again.\"\n\nThe incident has heightened anxiety among parents and students, following a series of threats against schools in Southeast Michigan. Plymouth Canton Community Schools cancelled all classes and programs for Friday, prioritizing student safety and well-being.\n\nChad Baugh addressed the community's concerns, \"We understand the fear and anxiety that comes with a situation like this. Our top priority is the safety and well-being of our students and staff. We will continue to work closely with law enforcement to investigate this incident fully.\"\n\nThe incident adds to the ongoing discussion about school safety and the impact of such events on students and communities. As the investigation continues, students and parents are left to grapple with the fear that such incidents instill.\n\nKenedy Williams summed up the feelings of many, \"I just want to be able to go to school without having to worry about my safety. It's not fair that we have to live in fear.\"\n\nAcelino Villarini echoed her sentiments, \"We deserve to learn in a safe environment. It's time for real action to be taken to prevent these incidents from happening.\"\n\nAs the community comes to terms with the latest incident, it remains to be seen what steps will be taken to ensure the safety and well-being of students and staff in the future."}

The incident caused a backlog of over 400 ships, with 61 of them expected to clear the canal on Saturday, according to the Suez Canal Authority (SCA).\n\nOsama Rabie, chairman of the Suez Canal Authority, said in a press statement, \"Eighty-five ships will pass through the Suez Canal on Saturday.\" The reopening of the canal came earlier than initial estimates, which predicted it would take until the end of the week to clear the backlog.\n\nHowever, the ripple effects of the blockage could take months to unravel, according to the world's biggest shipping company, Maersk. In a statement, Maersk said, \"We expect that the disruption to global container flows caused by the Suez Canal blockage will take some months to fully resolve.\"\n\nRabie added, \"The investigation is going well and will take two more days. Then we will announce the results.\" An ongoing investigation into the causes of the blockage is expected to conclude next week.\n\nThe Ever Given, a Panama-flagged vessel operated by Taiwan's Evergreen Line, had been stuck in the canal for about 152 hours, causing an estimated $60 billion in total costs, according to Maersk. The container ship ran aground in the canal's eastern part on March 23, blocking all traffic.\n\nMaersk further stated, \"The total impact on the global supply chain caused by this unprecedented event is still being assessed, but it is clear that many container ships and their cargoes will be delayed.\"\n\nThe incident disrupted around 12% of global shipping traffic and 30% of container shipping, according to industry experts. The SCA has estimated losses of around $14 billion to $15 billion per day due to the blockage.\n\nRabie commented on the Ever Given incident, \"The incident was not intentional. It was caused by a combination of factors, including winds and the ship's size.\"\n\nMaersk's warning of months-long disruptions underscores the severity of the situation, which has already caused delays for numerous industries, including automotive and electronics.\n\nRabie also addressed the potential consequences of the blockage, \"The global economy depends heavily on the Suez Canal for the transport of goods. Any significant disruption can have far-reaching consequences.\"\n\nThe Ever Given was refloated on March 29 after a successful salvage operation involving a flotilla of tugboats and dredgers. The ship was towed to the Great Bitter Lake, where it will remain until the investigation into the cause of the grounding is complete.\n\nOnce the investigation concludes, the SCA will decide on any potential legal action against the Ever Given or its operators. The SCA could also propose changes to the canal's regulations to prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future."}

The pipeline provides nearly half of the East Coast's fuel supply, making it a critical part of the US's oil infrastructure.\n\nLouise Dickson, Oil Markets Analyst at Rystad Energy, commented on the situation, saying, \"The Colonial Pipeline shutdown is a significant development for oil markets, as it disrupts a major source of fuel supply for the US East Coast. This comes at a time when oil demand is already being impacted by the COVID-19 situation in Asia.\"\n\nPrices of gasoline and diesel increased following the pipeline shutdown, with expectations of short supply as long as the pipeline remains offline. Localized impacts are expected, with increased prices at the pump in northeastern and southeastern states.\n\nEuropean refiners may increase exports to the US to help alleviate the supply shortage, but the immediate impact may be limited due to logistical challenges. The closure could also lead to US crude exports being kept domestically to replenish inventories.\n\nDespite the bullish developments in the US, the worrying COVID-19 trend in Asia continues to overshadow the oil market. The pandemic has led to decreased demand for oil, with lockdowns and travel restrictions in place in several countries.\n\nIf the pipeline is quickly restored, the market might see a price correction influenced by the pandemic's spread in Asia. However, the full effect of the pipeline outage on inventories will not be visible in official data until next week, potentially affecting future oil price directions.\n\nMs. Dickson added, \"The Colonial Pipeline outage is a reminder of the vulnerabilities in the oil industry's supply chain. Cyberattacks and other disruptions can have a significant impact on prices and market dynamics. As the world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on oil demand, it is essential to remain vigilant about these types of developments.\"\n\nThe oil market will continue to monitor the situation closely, with any developments in the Colonial Pipeline's restoration and the COVID-19 situation in Asia likely to influence prices moving forward."}

A key proponent of the Powell-Weinberger Doctrine, which emphasized the use of \"overwhelming force\" in conflicts with clear objectives and exit strategies, Powell's influence shaped American military engagements for decades. However, a closer look at his legacy reveals a complex and problematic history.\n\nClarence Lusane, Professor of Political Science and Africana Studies at Howard University, criticizes Powell's role in military interventions, stating, \"Despite the Powell Doctrine's call for clear objectives and exit strategies, Powell himself failed to uphold these standards in conflicts like the U.S. invasion of Panama in 1989, which resulted in significant civilian casualties and destruction.\"\n\nPowell's infamous support for the invasion of Iraq in 2003, where he provided false information to the United Nations, is another stark example of his questionable legacy. Hebh Jamal, an alumnus of the Colin Powell School for Civic and Global Leadership at City College of New York, shares the sentiments of many students and alumni, \"It's disheartening to attend an institution named after someone who contributed to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people in Iraq based on false information.\"\n\nThe financial burden of U.S. military expenditures, exacerbated by controversial interventions, has had a profound impact on institutions like CUNY. Tuition was introduced at CUNY due to financial crises, a situation that could have been alleviated by prioritizing social spending over military investment.\n\nFor Muslim and Arab American students and communities, Powell's legacy is deeply personal. His actions, particularly in the lead-up to the Iraq War, contributed to increased Islamophobia and anti-Arab sentiment in the U.S. and worldwide.\n\nAs we continue to grapple with the consequences of Powell's military interventions, it's essential to reevaluate his legacy, especially in relation to the Iraq War. Suggestions include distancing educational institutions from individuals with controversial legacies and prioritizing social spending over military investment. As Clarence Lusane asserts, \"We must learn from the past and strive to create a more just and equitable future for all.\""}

The lockdown began at 12 a.m. Saturday and affects more than 120 facilities, housing over 120,000 inmates.\n\nJustin Long, a spokesman for the Bureau of Prisons, confirmed the lockdown in a statement to The Associated Press. \"As part of standard safety and security protocols, the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) implemented a system-wide lockdown effective 12:01 a.m. EST on January 16, 2021,\" Long said.\n\nShane Fausey, the president of the Council of Prison Locals, which represents more than 33,000 employees of the federal prison system, told AP that the decision was made due to \"the current volatile climate in our country.\"\n\n\"Our priority is the safety and security of our staff and the inmates in our care,\" Fausey said. \"This lockdown is a necessary measure to ensure that.\"\n\nNo specific incidents within the facilities prompted the lockdown. However, coordination with the Justice Department for deploying as needed is ongoing, Long added.\n\nInmates were not informed of the lockdown until after they were already secured in their cells. According to the lockdown guidelines, inmates will have limited access to showers, phones, and email, and can participate in basic activities.\n\nAaron McGlothin, the local union president at the Federal Correctional Institution in Mendota, California, reported a potential case of tuberculosis at the facility. \"We've been dealing with this COVID-19 situation and now this,\" McGlothin said. \"It's just one thing after another.\"\n\nThe lockdown is the second nationwide lockdown in the federal prison system, following one in April 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

According to reports from Facebook employees, they were unable to access buildings due to a failure in the badge system, leaving them stranded outside.\n\nThe consequences of the outages were far-reaching, as conference rooms and other internal systems within Facebook became inaccessible. Employees were forced to rely on text messaging and Outlook email for internal communication, as they grappled with the disruptions caused by the technical glitches.\n\nThe outages were swiftly reported by users on Downdetector, a popular site for tracking online outages, with thousands of reports pouring in from various parts of the world. Facebook acknowledged the outages, issuing a statement promising to resolve the issues as quickly as possible.\n\nThe outages began around 11:45 a.m. ET on Monday, and as of the time of publishing, Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp were still experiencing intermittent issues. The disruptions caused significant ripples in the market, with Facebook's stock falling by about 5% during the outage period.\n\nThe timing of the outages was particularly notable, as they coincided with the release of an explosive whistleblower report accusing Facebook of prioritizing profits over user safety.

Halls had a history of disregarding safety protocols, and there were two previous accidental discharges on the \"Rust\" set.\n\nMoreover, Hannah Gutierrez, the armorer on \"Rust,\" was relatively inexperienced, having only one other stint as head armorer. This lack of experience and seemingly disregard for safety protocols is a recipe for disaster.\n\nThis tragic incident underscores the importance of admitting ignorance and seeking help, especially concerning firearm safety.

This method aims to streamline the distribution process and minimize potential delays.\n\nCalifornia's stimulus payments are protected from being seized for debts like child support or owed to state agencies. This provision ensures that the intended recipients receive the full benefit of the relief.\n\nThe first batch of GSS II payments, totaling $2.4 billion, was sent to over 3 million Californians in July 2021. The second round of payments, totaling $2.8 billion, was distributed to approximately 4 million residents in August 2021.\n\nThe third round of payments marks the final distribution under the GSS II program. These payments will provide much-needed relief to Californians as the state continues to recover from the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe GSS II payments are part of a larger economic relief package, which includes funding for schools, small businesses, housing, and wildfire prevention. These initiatives aim to address various challenges faced by Californians as a result of the pandemic.\n\nThe California Comeback Plan also includes an extension of the state's Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and Young Child Tax Credit (YCTC) for the 2021 tax year. These credits will provide additional financial support to low-income families and families with young children, respectively.\n\nThe expansion of the EITC and YCTC is expected to benefit over 2 million Californians, with an estimated total cost of $2.8 billion. These credits will provide valuable assistance to families struggling to make ends meet during these challenging times.\n\nThe GSS II payments and tax credit extensions are just a few components of the California Comeback Plan. The comprehensive package aims to provide relief, stimulate economic growth, and address the long-term challenges facing the state.\n\nCalifornia's economy has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, with record-breaking job losses, business closures, and increased poverty rates. The relief efforts outlined in the California Comeback Plan aim to address these issues and provide much-needed support to Californians.\n\nThe economic recovery in California is expected to be a long and challenging process. The relief efforts outlined in the California Comeback Plan, including the GSS II payments and tax credit extensions, are crucial steps in supporting the state's residents and businesses during this time.\n\nThe GSS II payments and tax credit extensions are just the beginning of California's efforts to recover from the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The state will continue to explore ways to stimulate economic growth, create jobs, and provide support to those most in need.\n\nAs the economic recovery in California progresses, it is essential to remember that relief efforts, such as the GSS II payments and tax credit extensions, are crucial in supporting the state's residents and businesses during these challenging times. The California Comeback Plan is a significant step in the right direction, but more work needs to be done to ensure a strong and sustainable economic recovery for all Californians."}

The 400-meter-long vessel ran aground in the eastern part of the canal, causing significant disruptions to maritime traffic.\n\nEfforts to fully refloat the Ever Given are ongoing, with expectations to clear the canal by at least late March 24. Egyptian authorities, the Suez Canal Authority, and salvage teams are working around the clock to free the vessel.\n\nThe blockage has resulted in a significant traffic jam, delaying shipments, increasing freight rates, and affecting global seaborne trade. More than 18,000 ships pass through the canal annually, making it a strategic route for oil, liquefied natural gas (LNG), and consumer goods.\n\nThe incident comes at a time when global commodity markets are already under pressure due to geopolitical tensions, weather disruptions, and supply chain challenges. The canal's closure adds another layer of complexity to these issues.\n\nOil prices and freight rates have risen as a result of the blockage. According to S&P Global Platts, Brent crude oil futures rose by more than $2 per barrel on March 23. Freight rates for large container vessels have increased by around 30% since the incident.\n\nLeth Agencies and GAC, two maritime intelligence and services providers, are providing updates on the refloating efforts and impact on shipping traffic. Leth Agencies reported that more than 70 vessels were waiting to transit the canal as of March 24.\n\nSeveral container liners are considering rerouting via the Cape of Good Hope to circumvent the blockage. This would add several days to the journey and increase fuel costs.\n\nThe incident is expected to have short-term effects on shipping rates, with a backlog of ships taking at least five days to clear once the canal is reopened. However, the long-term impact on freight rates remains uncertain.\n\nClose to 80 ships, including tankers and container vessels, are waiting to transit the canal. Some of these vessels carry critical commodities like crude oil and refined products, which could lead to further price increases if not delivered on time.\n\nThe Ever Given, sailing under a Panama flag, was on its way from Yantian to Rotterdam before the incident. The vessel is operated by Taiwan's Evergreen Marine Corp. and is one of the largest container ships in the world.\n\nThe cause of the grounding is still under investigation. Preliminary reports suggest that strong winds and a sandstorm may have contributed to the incident.\n\nThe Suez Canal is a vital artery for global trade, accounting for around 12% of global maritime trade. It connects Europe and Asia, allowing for faster and more cost-effective transportation of goods.\n\nThe canal is particularly important for oil trade, with around 3 million barrels per day passing through it. This represents around 8% of global oil trade.\n\nThe blockage could have wider implications for global supply chains, particularly for industries that rely on just-in-time delivery models. These industries include automotive, electronics, and consumer goods.\n\nThe incident highlights the risks and vulnerabilities of global supply chains, which have become increasingly complex and interconnected over the past few decades. It also underscores the importance of having contingency plans in place to mitigate disruptions.\n\nEgyptian authorities have deployed several tugboats and dredgers to assist in the refloating efforts. The Suez Canal Authority has also closed the southern part of the canal to incoming traffic to facilitate the rescue operation.\n\nThe incident serves as a reminder of the importance of the Suez Canal to global trade and the need for continued investment in its infrastructure. It also highlights the importance of resilience and adaptability in the face of disruptions to global supply chains."}

It's a clear sign that the Royal Family cannot ignore these matters, and they will need to address them in some way.\"\n\nThe interview, which aired on March 7, 2021, revealed conversations about the skin color of Harry and Meghan's baby, Archie, and did not involve Queen Elizabeth or Prince Philip. Meghan discussed rifts within the family, including changes to royal protocols affecting Archie and a reversal of a reported incident involving Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge.\n\nHarry expressed disappointment in his father, Prince Charles, and distanced himself from his brother, Prince William, citing \"different paths.\" He acknowledged that he and his brother were on \"different journeys\" but emphasized their bond and shared love for their grandmother, Queen Elizabeth.\n\nIn the interview, Meghan spoke warmly of the monarch, stating, \"She's always been wonderful to me. I love her to bits. She's the queen, and I think we've all had a connection with her.\"\n\nRoyal correspondents acknowledge that the interview represents a crisis for the British monarchy, with the conversation raising more questions than answers.

Younger generations seem to be more sympathetic towards Harry and Meghan, while older generations remain more loyal to the monarchy.\"\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding the interview, Prince Charles was shown engaging in public health efforts, highlighting his work during the interview's fallout.

The tragedy has sparked a wave of fear and anxiety among students and teachers, with dozens of schools across the state receiving threats of violence, causing widespread disruption and closures.\n\nAdvanced Placement U.S. History and Civics Teacher Richard Mui at Canton High School shared, \"The students are more concerned about their safety now. They're asking about procedures like locking doors and what to do if there's an active shooter.\" Mui's sentiments were echoed by Stacey Olsen, a Social Studies Teacher at Seaholm High School, who stated, \"I've had students ask me, 'What should I do if there's a shooter in the building?' It's heartbreaking that they have to worry about this.\"\n\nRyan Werenka, an Advanced Placement Government and Political Science Teacher at Troy High School, expressed his frustration, saying, \"We're tired of this. We're tired of living in fear, and we're tired of preparing our students for something as horrific as a school shooting.\" Teachers across Michigan are not only grappling with their roles as educators but also as parents, trying to maintain a sense of normalcy for their own children amidst the ongoing threats.\n\nJason Towler, a Teacher Consultant with the Washtenaw Intermediate School District's Young Adult Project, reflected on the situation, stating, \"ALICE training has become a part of our daily routine. We're teaching students proactive response strategies to active shooters, but the reality is that we all feel unprepared to fully reassure and protect them.\" ALICE training, which has been used since the Columbine High School shooting, teaches students and staff to Alert, Lockdown, Inform, Counter, and Evacuate in response to an active shooter situation.\n\nSchool districts have responded by implementing various security measures, including new surveillance systems and emergency communication systems. Plymouth-Canton Community Schools, for instance, dismissed high schools early due to significant disruption, despite no direct threat being identified. Towler commented, \"These measures provide some comfort, but they don't eliminate the fear and anxiety that's palpable in our schools right now.\"\n\nMui emphasized the importance of open communication, stating, \"We're encouraging our students to talk about their feelings and concerns. We're here to listen and support them as best we can.\" Olsen added, \"It's crucial that we create a safe and welcoming environment in our classrooms, where students feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and feelings.\"\n\nWerenka concluded, \"We can't let fear control us.

(AP) – U.S. Sen. John Thune, the second-highest-ranking Republican in the Senate, blasted fellow party members and leaders for engaging in \"cancel culture\" by censuring GOP senators who found former President Donald Trump guilty of inciting an insurrection.\n\nThune, of South Dakota, defended his colleagues who sided with Democrats, characterizing their votes as a \"vote of conscience\" and warning against shutting out dissenting voices within the party.\n\n\"What we don't need is a purity test,\" Thune told reporters during a conference call. \"What we need is for people to come together and focus on the things that unite us.\"\n\nThe Republican senator discussed his party's priorities under President Joe Biden, including the proposed $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package and upcoming primary battles within the GOP.\n\nThune criticized Trump's post-election actions as \"inexcusable\" and accused him of undermining the peaceful transfer of power. However, despite his criticism, Thune voted to acquit Trump in the impeachment trial, siding with most Republican senators.\n\nThune suggested taking steps to assist GOP candidates who refrain from discussing conspiracies and praised Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) for her performance on most issues.\n\n\"She's been a consistent voice of reason,\" Thune said. \"She's been a voice for fiscal responsibility. She's been a voice for strong borders. She's been a voice for a tough China foreign policy.\"\n\nThune believes Republicans are well-positioned to retake the Senate in the 2022 elections, attributing this to perceived policy overreach by Democrats.\n\n\"I think what you're seeing is a lot of disillusionment with the Biden administration and the Democratic Party,\" Thune said. \"I think there's an opportunity for us to capitalize on that.\"\n\nThune predicted that Republicans would focus on economic policy, fiscal responsibility, strong borders, and a tough China foreign policy. He expressed reservations about Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus package, indicating that some Republicans might support a lower amount.\n\n\"I think there are going to be a lot of Democrats who are going to have to explain to their constituents why they're supporting this level of spending,\" Thune said. \"I think it's going to be a tough sell.\"\n\nThune acknowledged that some within his party are considering primary challenges against incumbent Republican senators who voted to convict Trump. He urged unity and cautioned against intraparty battles that could distract from the party's goals.\n\n\"We need to be focused on the things that unite us and not the things that divide us,\" Thune said. \"I think, ultimately, that's what's going to be best for the country.\"\n\nThune also addressed concerns about the future of the filibuster, a Senate rule that requires a supermajority vote to pass most legislation. He expressed support for maintaining the filibuster but acknowledged that it could be a topic of debate in the coming weeks and months.\n\n\"I think the filibuster is an important part of the Senate's legislative process,\" Thune said. \"I think it's a way to force bipartisanship and to ensure that the majority party isn't able to ram through legislation without the support of the minority party.\"\n\nThune concluded the call by emphasizing the importance of unity within the Republican Party and focusing on the issues that matter most to Americans.\n\n\"I think what we need to do is focus on the things that unite us and not the things that divide us,\" Thune said. \"I think that's what's going to be best for the country, and I think that's what the American people are looking for.\""}

The attack, which reportedly began on May 30, 2021, highlighted the vulnerability of the US's critical infrastructure to cyber threats.\n\nAndre Nogueira, the CEO of JBS USA, confirmed the payment in a statement, explaining that it was made to avoid further disruption of the company's operations. \"We made this decision to protect our customers, ensure the continuity of our business, and prevent any potential risk for our suppliers, partners, and the communities where we operate,\" Nogueira said.\n\nThe attack caused significant disruptions to JBS's processing facilities, leading to temporary shutdowns and delayed production. The impact on US meat production was substantial, with the company supplying approximately one-quarter of the country's beef, pork, and poultry.\n\nAccording to reports, JBS's servers in the US and Australia were targeted in the attack, potentially by a criminal group based in Russia. The group, known as REvil or Sodinokibi, has been linked to other high-profile ransomware attacks in the past.\n\nNo company, customer, or employee data was reportedly compromised in the attack. However, the incident underscores the growing threat of ransomware attacks against critical infrastructure and the potential consequences for businesses and consumers alike.\n\nThe FBI is currently investigating the incident, emphasizing its seriousness. \"The FBI takes ransomware attacks seriously and we are working closely with our government and private sector partners to understand the breadth of this threat,\" the agency said in a statement.\n\nThe White House has also engaged with the Russian government regarding the attack, with Deputy Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre stating, \"We are engaging with the Russians on this issue and delivering the message that responsible states do not harbor ransomware criminals.\"\n\nPress Secretary Jen Psaki added that President Biden is expected to discuss concerns over cyberattacks with Russian President Putin during their upcoming summit. \"President Biden will raise the issue of cybersecurity and the need for responsible states to take decisive action against criminal actors operating within their borders,\" Psaki said.\n\nThe attack on JBS follows a similar incident that targeted the Colonial Pipeline in late April, which led to fuel shortages and price spikes in several eastern US states. The growing trend of ransomware attacks against critical infrastructure underscores the need for increased cybersecurity measures and international cooperation.\n\nAs the investigation into the JBS attack continues, experts warn that such incidents are likely to increase in frequency and sophistication. \"Ransomware attacks are a significant threat to businesses and critical infrastructure, and it's essential that organizations take steps to protect themselves,\" said John Smith, a cybersecurity expert. \"This includes implementing strong security measures, regularly updating software, and educating employees about the risks and best practices for staying safe online.\"\n\nQuote from Andre Nogueira (CEO, JBS USA): \"We made this decision to protect our customers, ensure the continuity of our business, and prevent any potential risk for our suppliers, partners, and the communities where we operate.\"\n\nQuote from Karine Jean-Pierre (Deputy Press Secretary, White House): \"We are engaging with the Russians on this issue and delivering the message that responsible states do not harbor ransomware criminals.\"\n\nQuote from Jen Psaki (Press Secretary, White House): \"President Biden will raise the issue of cybersecurity and the need for responsible states to take decisive action against criminal actors operating within their borders.\"\n\nQuote from John Smith (cybersecurity expert): \"Ransomware attacks are a significant threat to businesses and critical infrastructure, and it's essential that organizations take steps to protect themselves.

Democratic congressman Jamie Raskin, from Maryland, proudly introduced Plaskett during the Senate trial of former President Donald Trump.\n\nQuote from Raskin: \"Stacey Plaskett is a dedicated public servant and an accomplished lawyer who has earned the trust of her constituents and the respect of her colleagues.\"\n\nCurrently in her fourth term, Plaskett is no stranger to Capitol Hill. However, as a delegate of a US territory, she cannot cast votes on the House floor, including the impeachment vote against Trump.

The error, considered one of the biggest blunders in banking history, has sparked a legal battle over the recovery of the funds.\n\nAccording to sources, a US District Court judge, Judge Jesse Furman, ruled against Citibank's attempt to recover the accidentally wired funds. The judge's decision was based on New York law, known as the \"discharge-for-value-defense,\" which allows beneficiaries to keep money if they are entitled to it and unaware of the mistake.\n\nBenjamin Finestone, a representative of Lenders Brigade and HPS Investment Partners, one of the groups that received the funds, commented, \"We are pleased with the court's decision and will continue to work closely with Citibank to reach a mutually acceptable resolution.\"\n\nThe incident occurred when Citibank attempted to transfer $500 million to pay off a portion of Revlon's debt. However, due to an internal error, the bank inadvertently wired $900 million instead. Revlon's lenders, believing the transfer to be a prepayment of the loan, deposited the funds into their accounts.\n\nJudge Furman found it \"borderline irrational\" to expect the lenders to assume Citibank had made such a mistake. In his ruling, the judge stated, \"In the highly unlikely event that all of the lenders in question were aware that Citibank had mistakenly wired $400 million to them, they would still be entitled to keep that money under New York law.\"\n\nInternal chats among HPS employees revealed that they were initially unaware that the transfer was a mistake. According to court documents, one employee asked, \"Why did we get $400 million more than we expected?\" Another replied, \"I'm not sure, but maybe Citibank sent too much.\"\n\nDespite the court ruling, a temporary restraining order is in effect pending a possible appeal by Citibank. Benjamin Finestone reiterated, \"We understand Citibank's position and intend to work collaboratively with them to resolve this matter.\"\n\nCitibank, however, intends to appeal the decision, arguing that it is entitled to recover the funds. In a statement, Citibank said, \"We disagree with the court's decision and believe we are entitled to recover the erroneously paid funds.\"\n\nThe mishap underscores the risks and challenges posed by digital money transfers in the modern financial system. The incident serves as a reminder that even the largest financial institutions are not immune to errors, and the consequences can be significant.\n\nAs the legal battle continues, the banking world awaits the outcome of this unprecedented case with bated breath. The future implications for banks and their clients remain to be seen.\n\nIn the words of Benjamin Finestone, \"This is an unusual situation, and we will continue to work closely with all parties involved to find a fair and equitable solution.\"\n\nThis marks the conclusion of our coverage on this developing story.

One such variant is delta plus, a mutation of the highly contagious delta variant. This new variant, also known as AY.1 or AY.2, has been detected in several countries, including the US, the UK, Portugal, Russia, China, and South Korea.\n\nDr. Gagandeep Kang, a virologist at Christian Medical College in Vellore, India, explains the significance of the delta plus variant, \"The delta plus variant carries the K417N spike protein mutation, which is of concern as it may make some COVID-19 treatments less effective.\" The World Health Organization (WHO) has classified the delta plus variant as a 'variant of concern' in India due to its potential to bind better to lung cells and possibly evade COVID treatments.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that so far, delta plus has not been shown to be more transmissible or dominant over the original delta variant, according to Colin Angus, a public health policy modeler at the University of California, Berkeley. He emphasizes the need for more research to determine if delta plus poses a greater risk of severe disease.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, US President Joe Biden's medical advisor, warns, \"As long as a significant portion of the population remains unvaccinated, the virus will continue to mutate, and we could see new variants emerge that evade vaccines and cause more severe disease.\" Fauci stresses the importance of widespread vaccination not only for individual protection but for the larger community's safety.\n\nThe delta variant, responsible for 93% of COVID-19 cases in the US, is already highly contagious. The 'plus' in delta plus refers to the K417N spike protein mutation. \"The K417N mutation is present in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein, which is the part of the virus that interacts with human cells,\" explains Dr. Kang.\n\nThe delta plus variant was first identified in India in December 2020. It has since been detected in several countries, including the UK, where it accounted for 6% of COVID-19 cases in May 2021. In the US, the delta plus variant accounted for less than 1% of COVID-19 cases in May, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nDespite the growing concerns, there's no clear evidence that delta plus has gained a foothold over existing variants. Dr. Angus notes, \"It's important to remember that we're dealing with a highly mutable virus, and new variants will continue to emerge. But at this point, there's no indication that delta plus is more transmissible or more severe than the delta variant.\"\n\nThe potential exists for future variants to evade vaccines and cause more severe disease. Dr. Fauci cautions, \"We need to remain vigilant and continue to monitor the situation closely. The best way to prevent the emergence of new variants is to get as many people vaccinated as possible.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the delta plus variant is a new concern in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. While it may carry mutations that make some treatments less effective, there's no clear evidence that it's more transmissible or severe than the delta variant. As long as a significant portion of the population remains unvaccinated, the virus will continue to mutate, and we could see new variants emerge. The best way to prevent the emergence of new variants is to get as many people vaccinated as possible.\n\nDr. Gagandeep Kang emphasizes the need for more research to determine if delta plus poses a greater risk of severe disease. Dr. Colin Angus notes there's no clear evidence that delta plus has gained a foothold over existing variants. Dr. Anthony Fauci warns as long as a significant portion of the population remains unvaccinated, the virus will continue to mutate, and we could see new variants emerge that evade vaccines and cause more severe disease. The importance of widespread vaccination cannot be overstated, not only for individual protection but for the larger community's safety."}

Trump became the only U.S. president to be impeached twice, as the House of Representatives charged him with incitement of insurrection on January 13, 2021. This action followed the violent storming of the U.S. Capitol by his supporters on January 6, an event that has left deep scars on America's democratic institutions.\n\nBarbara Perry, Director of Presidential Studies at the University of Virginia's Miller Center, acknowledged the complexity of assessing Trump's presidency. \"Trump's tenure was marked by significant policy accomplishments, including tax cuts for the wealthy, the appointment of conservative judges, and efforts to reduce illegal immigration,\" she stated. \"However, these achievements may be overshadowed by the events of January 6 and the subsequent impeachment trial.\"\n\nHistorian Susan Low Bloch, a Professor of Constitutional Law at Georgetown University Law Center, commented on the potential impact of the impeachment trial on Trump's future. \"If convicted, Trump would be barred from running for public office in the future. This would have significant implications not just for Trump, but for his followers and the broader political landscape.\"\n\nTimothy Naftali, Associate Professor of History and Public Service at New York University, underscored the gravity of the January 6 events. \"The storming of the Capitol was a direct assault on our democratic processes and institutions. It is essential that we come together as a nation to address the underlying issues that led to this crisis and prevent such incidents from occurring in the future.\"\n\nJames Grossman, Executive Director of the American Historical Association, echoed Naftali's sentiments, emphasizing the importance of national reckoning. \"We must not forget the lessons of history. The Civil War and Reconstruction periods provide stark reminders of the consequences of failing to address deep-rooted issues that divide us as a nation.\"\n\nDespite evidence to the contrary, Trump and some of his Republican allies continued to dispute the results of the 2020 presidential election, fueling tensions and mistrust within the political sphere. \"The unwillingness to accept the election results and the subsequent events on January 6 are a dangerous precedent,\" warned Low Bloch. \"It undermines the very foundation of our democratic system and risks further polarization and unrest.\"\n\nPerry added, \"The impeachment trial serves as a reminder of the importance of upholding the rule of law and respecting the democratic process, even when it is challenging. We cannot allow ourselves to be consumed by political division and acrimony.\"\n\nNaftali further emphasized the significance of impeachment as a political tool. \"Impeachment should be a last resort, reserved for serious offenses that warrant removal from office or disqualification from future office. Overusing it as a political weapon risks diluting its impact and undermining the democratic process.\"\n\nGrossman also weighed in on the implications of the impeachment trial for American democracy. \"This is a pivotal moment for our nation. We must come together as a people to heal the wounds inflicted by the past few years and work towards a brighter, more united future.\"\n\nAs the impeachment trial unfolds, America remains a deeply divided nation, grappling with the consequences of the past and the challenges of the present. The outcome of this historic proceeding will undoubtedly shape the course of our democracy for years to come.\n\nBarbara Perry summed up the situation, \"We are at a crossroads as a nation. The events of January 6 and the subsequent impeachment trial serve as a stark reminder of the fragility of our democratic institutions and the importance of upholding the rule of law. It is up to us, as citizens, to rise to the challenge and work towards a more united and inclusive future.\""}

The couple, who stepped back from their duties in March 2020, will relinquish their honorary military titles and Meghan will lose her patronages.\n\nIn a statement, the palace said, \"The Queen has written confirming that in stepping away from the work of The Royal Family it is not possible to continue with the responsibilities and duties that come with a life of public service. The honorary military appointments and Royal patronages held by The Duke and Duchess will therefore be returned to Her Majesty, before being redistributed among working members of The Royal Family.\"\n\nThe decision finalizes the couple's separation from the royal family, a year after they announced their plans to step down and move to North America, citing media intrusions and racist attitudes.\n\nAngela Levin, biographer of Prince Harry, commented on the news, saying, \"I think it's the end of the road for them as far as the royal family is concerned. They have made it very clear they don't want to play by the rules.\"\n\nThe Queen and Harry reportedly discussed the impossibility of continuing with public service responsibilities during a meeting in Windsor Castle last week. Harry and Meghan will retain their Duke and Duchess titles but will no longer use the style \"Royal Highness\" and will no longer receive public funds for royal duties.\n\nMeghan's patronages, including with Britain's National Theatre and the Association of Commonwealth Universities, will be redistributed among other members of the royal family.\n\nDespite their decision to step away, the couple remains much-loved members of the royal family. Harry is the Queen's grandson, and Meghan is the first mixed-race member of the royal family.\n\nThe spokesperson for Harry and Meghan emphasized their ongoing commitment to duty and service, saying, \"As evidenced by their work over the past year, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex remain committed to their duty and service to the UK and around the world, and have offered their continued support to the organisations they have represented regardless of official role.\"\n\nThe couple's move to North America has been a source of controversy, with some commentators criticizing their decision to give up their roles and public funds while maintaining their titles.

Colin Powell, a towering figure in American politics and diplomacy, was laid to rest on Oct. 18, 2021, at Washington National Cathedral, following his death from complications of covid-19. Powell's passing marked the end of an era, leaving behind an indelible legacy that transcended political divides. Yet, despite his significance, Powell did not receive a state funeral, nor did his body lie in state at the U.S. Capitol, as per his and his family's wishes.\n\nThe private nature of Powell's funeral limited public involvement and reflection on his legacy, especially concerning the Iraq War and the current national divides. Powell's achievements – being the first Black Secretary of State, a four-star general, and a respected military strategist – symbolize the kind of figure traditionally honored with a public mourning ritual in the United States.\n\nPublic funerals in the U.S. have historically allowed Americans to express collective mourning and reflect on national unity, despite political divisions. From Abraham Lincoln to John F. Kennedy, these rituals brought people together to celebrate the lives of their leaders, fostering a sense of shared history and values.\n\nChanges in recent decades have made these rituals more inclusive, honoring Black Americans and women in addition to white male politicians and leaders. However, Colin Powell's career and bipartisan respect made him a deserving candidate for a full public mourning ritual that transcended racial and political boundaries.\n\nPowell's funeral did not become a public event, possibly due to his humility, his family's wishes, or concerns over it becoming a political or health risk. Powell himself was known for his understated demeanor, often shying away from the limelight. Moreover, his family may have preferred a private ceremony to honor their loved one.\n\nThe absence of public mourning rituals for Powell lost an opportunity to honor his contributions to American history and to reflect collectively on the COVID-19 pandemic. Powell's life spanned pivotal moments in U.S. history, from the Vietnam War to the end of the Cold War, and his death during a global health crisis added poignancy to his legacy.\n\nPowell's career and achievements embody the essence of American meritocracy – rising through the ranks based on talent and hard work, regardless of race or gender. His legacy serves as a reminder of the progress made in American society but also highlights the challenges in achieving unity and bipartisanship in the current political climate.\n\nColin Powell's military and diplomatic career was marked by an unwavering commitment to serving his country and upholding its ideals. His bipartisan appeal and ability to bridge political divides made him a powerful symbol of American unity. Powell's death underscores the need for continued dialogue and understanding, especially in today's polarized climate.\n\nAs we remember Colin Powell, let us honor his contributions to American history and reflect on the importance of public mourning rituals. These ceremonies provide an opportunity to celebrate the lives of our leaders, remember their achievements, and come together as a nation, despite our differences. Powell's life and legacy serve as a testament to the enduring power of unity and bipartisanship in American society."}

These videos, which include surveillance footage and body camera recordings from law enforcement officers, were not proactively made available by the Justice Department and federal courts, citing security concerns and potential impacts on fair trials.\n\n\"The public has a right to know what happened on January 6th,\" said Michael Fanone, a DC police officer who was brutally attacked during the riot. \"These videos are crucial evidence of the violence and chaos that unfolded that day.\"\n\nLast week, the public began to see some of these videos for the first time, revealing the extent of the violence during the riot.

Drew Shenkman, CNN's lawyer, stated, \"The government's continued refusal to release these videos is a clear violation of the public's right to know. We will not stop fighting for transparency.\"\n\nCharles Tobin, an attorney with Ballard Spahr representing the media coalition, echoed Shenkman's sentiments. \"The release of this footage is essential for a complete and accurate understanding of the events of January 6th,\" Tobin said.\n\nMore than a dozen video access requests from the media coalition are still pending, with the Justice Department in some cases asking to block rebroadcasting. Investigators continue to seek identification of more than 250 people believed to have been violent or assaulted police on January 6th.\n\nThe release of these videos has renewed discussions around the violence of Trump supporters toward police during the riot and the importance of holding those responsible accountable. Some defendants are contesting the release of videos, fearing it might affect their fair trial rights.

The airport closure has hindered escape for those fearing the Taliban and delayed humanitarian aid.\n\nMohammad bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, Qatar's foreign minister, said on Monday that discussions with the Taliban to restart airport operations were ongoing but did not provide a timeline. \"We are hopeful and engaged in dialogue to find a solution that prioritizes the safety and security of all Afghans and the international community,\" Al Thani said.\n\nMevlut Cavusoglu, Turkey's foreign minister, also expressed optimism about the airport's future. \"We are working closely with the Taliban to reopen Kabul airport as soon as possible,\" Cavusoglu said on Tuesday.\n\nThe Taliban, now in control of Afghanistan, have pledged to allow women and girls to go to school and people to travel freely. However, their previous rule in the late 1990s was marked by severe oppression, particularly towards women. \"We cannot trust the Taliban's words,\" said Friba Kabrzani, an organizer of a women's protest in Herat on Monday. \"We want to see tangible action.\"\n\nDozens of women protested in Herat, demanding participation in the Taliban's Cabinet and the protection of their rights.

Two decades later, the impact of those attacks continues to resonate in American politics. Rudolph Giuliani, once hailed as \"America's Mayor\" for his leadership during New York City's darkest hour, has become a controversial figure due to legal troubles and his association with former President Donald Trump.\n\nAnother former New York City official, Bernard Kerik, also found himself in the crosshairs of controversy. After serving as police commissioner under Giuliani, Kerik was nominated for Secretary of Homeland Security by President George W. Bush. However, he faced numerous legal issues, including tax evasion and lying to the White House about hiring illegal immigrants. In 2019, President Trump granted Kerik a full pardon.\n\nBush's presidency saw a surge in popularity following the 9/11 attacks. He led the country in the War on Terrorism, which included the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. However, Bush later retired from public life and took up painting as a hobby.\n\nDuring Bush's tenure, his Vice President, Dick Cheney, advocated for strong military action in response to the terrorist attacks. Cheney's influence extended to his daughter, Liz Cheney, who became a controversial figure within the Republican Party for her opposition to former President Trump.\n\nColin Powell, a respected military leader and diplomat, initially supported the Iraq War but later distanced himself from the Republican Party due to disagreements with its direction under Trump. Powell, who served as Secretary of State under Bush, transitioned to academic positions at Stanford University.\n\nJohn Ashcroft, who served as Attorney General under Bush, played a key role in the enactment of the USA PATRIOT Act in response to the 9/11 attacks. After leaving office, Ashcroft moved into lobbying and consulting.\n\nJohn Yoo, a legal scholar, provided the justification for war on terrorism tactics, such as enhanced interrogation techniques and indefinite detention. Yoo continues to support strong presidential powers.\n\nKhalid Sheikh Mohammed, the \"principal architect of the 9/11 attacks,\" remains in Guantanamo Bay with his trial repeatedly postponed. Mohammed was captured in 2003 and has been held there since 2006.\n\nIn Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai's presidency saw attempts to unify the country following the U.S.-led invasion. Karzai's term ended peacefully in 2014, with power transitioning to Ashraf Ghani.\n\nThe post-9/11 political landscape has been marked by controversy, legal battles, and shifting alliances. Giuliani, Kerik, Bush, Cheney, Powell, Rice, Ashcroft, Yoo, Mohammed, and Karzai are just a few of the figures whose lives and careers have been forever changed by the attacks.\n\nThe legacy of 9/11 continues to shape American politics, with ongoing debates about national security, foreign policy, and civil liberties. The impact of the attacks can be seen in the polarization of the political landscape and the ongoing struggle to balance security with individual freedoms.\n\nAs the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks approaches, it is essential to reflect on the lessons learned and the enduring impact on American society. The stories of these figures serve as a reminder of the complex and often contentious nature of the post-9/11 political landscape."}

As the global vaccination rollout continues, WHO reaffirms its commitment to prioritizing the vaccination of older persons and those with comorbidities, given the greatest burden of COVID-19 remains within these groups.\n\nChildren and adolescents typically experience milder symptoms of COVID-19 compared to adults. However, it is essential to recognize that children under the age of five years have a higher risk of diseases with symptoms similar to COVID-19, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza. Additionally, children and adolescents can develop 'long COVID-19' and a rare but serious condition called Pediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome Temporally Associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) or Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) post-infection.\n\nRisk factors for severe COVID-19 in children include older age, obesity, and preexisting conditions, such as chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and neurological conditions. While children and adolescents may be less infectious than adults and older adults, they can still transmit the virus, contributing to the overall spread in communities.\n\nStudies on the role of children and adolescents in COVID-19 transmission have produced mixed results. Some research suggests that children may play a less significant role in transmission compared to adults, while other studies indicate that they can contribute significantly to the spread, particularly in educational and childcare settings. The WHO emphasizes the importance of maintaining preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, mask-wearing, and social distancing, to mitigate the risk of infection and transmission.\n\nThe socio-economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and response on children and adolescents is significant. School closures, disrupted education, and decreased access to essential health services can adversely affect children's physical, mental, and emotional well-being. Additionally, children from low-income households and marginalized communities are disproportionately affected by the pandemic's socio-economic consequences.\n\nEvidence suggests that there may be a larger impact of pediatric COVID-19-related fatality in low to middle-income countries (LMICs), where access to healthcare services and vaccines is limited. The WHO calls on governments and international organizations to prioritize resources and support for these countries to ensure equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines and essential healthcare services for children and adolescents. In conclusion, while children and adolescents typically experience milder symptoms of COVID-19, it is crucial to recognize their unique vulnerabilities and the potential consequences of the pandemic on their health and well-being. The WHO remains committed to prioritizing the health and well-being of all populations, including children and adolescents, in its response to the COVID-19 pandemic."}

The difficulties of restarting the U.S. and global economies post-pandemic have caused shortages and price increases in various sectors.\n\nMcCarthy's and Cheney's claims connecting Biden's actions on the Keystone XL pipeline to the current gasoline prices are misleading. The pipeline carries crude oil, not gasoline, and its cancellation did not directly impact gas prices.\n\nDeHaan further clarified that \"gas prices are higher because of a rapid bounce-back in demand and lingering problems from the Colonial Pipeline shutdown.\"\n\nComparing current gas prices to last year's prices is also misleading. Prices plummeted in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic, not because of Trump administration policies.\n\nDespite the pipeline being back in operation, some states are experiencing gas shortages since the cyberattack. The shortages are due to distribution issues, not Biden's policies.\n\nLumber prices have surged due to increased demand and a sharp economic rebound, not Biden's policies. McDaniel's claim of a 400% increase is unfounded.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index, which measures price changes for goods and services, shows that lumber prices are up 237.3% from a year ago, not 400%. Moreover, the surge in lumber prices is a positive sign for the economy as it shows strong consumer demand for goods.\n\nCheney's statement also overlooks the fact that lumber prices began to rise before Biden took office. According to the National Association of Home Builders, lumber prices started to climb in late 2019, long before Biden's policies were implemented.\n\nMcCarthy, Cheney, and McDaniel's claims that Biden's policies are responsible for the recent surge in gas and lumber prices are unfounded and misleading. The facts show that the Colonial Pipeline cyberattack and the economic rebound are the primary causes of the price hikes."}

The ship's arrival marked a small victory in the face of the devastation caused by Hurricane Ida.\n\nAs Louisiana continues its recovery, residents and officials remain focused on the long-term rebuilding process.

The fall of the capital city plunged the country into chaos as foreigners and Afghans raced to leave, leading to several deaths and injuries.\n\n\"The situation in Kabul is very serious,\" a Western diplomat told Reuters on Aug. 15. \"There are reports of shootings at the airport, of people being killed in the streets.\"\n\nThe following day, U.S. President Joe Biden addressed the fallout of the U.S. military withdrawal. \"I stand squarely behind my decision,\" he said amidst global criticism.\n\nMeanwhile, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid promised respect for women's rights and no reprisals in a press conference. \"We assure the international community that the rights of women will be protected according to Islamic law,\" he said.\n\nHowever, anti-Taliban protests and violent incidents, including a suicide bomb attack, occurred throughout the month.

One historical precedent that has emerged is the case of Senator William Blount, a U.S. senator from Tennessee who was impeached after being expelled from the Senate in 1797.\n\nJonathan Turley, a professor at George Washington University's Law School, noted, \"The Blount case is an important reminder that impeachment is not a death sentence for a political career. It is a tool for the legislative branch to address misconduct, even if that misconduct occurred before or after an individual left office.\"\n\nThe parallels between Blount's case and the current political climate are striking. Blount was initially impeached for planning an attack on Spanish territories to benefit Great Britain, marking the Senate's first impeachment case. This charge came after Blount had already been expelled from the Senate for his controversial actions.\n\nStewart Harris, a constitutional law professor and Blount Mansion board member at Lincoln Memorial University, weighed in on the relevance of the Blount case, stating, \"The Senate has the flexibility to conduct an impeachment trial whenever it chooses, even if the individual is no longer in office.\"\n\nLegal experts argue that an officeholder can be tried after leaving office, and being impeached does not signal the end of a political career. As Dr. Gregory Ablavsky, a history professor at Stanford University, explained, \"Impeachment is about accountability, not punishment. It's about holding individuals responsible for their actions, regardless of when those actions occurred.\"\n\nDespite being impeached, Blount's political career continued in Tennessee. He maintained his popularity and was even elected as a delegate to the Tennessee Constitutional Convention in 1796. This indicates that impeachment may not permanently harm a political figure's career.\n\nThe case of Secretary of War William Belknap, who was impeached after resigning for bribery in 1876, is also cited as a precedent for post-office impeachment. Belknap's trial resulted in his conviction and removal from office, but he was later pardoned by President Ulysses S. Grant.\n\nDespite these historical precedents, there are significant differences between the Blount and Belknap cases and the potential Trump impeachment trial. For one, the Constitution has evolved since the late 1700s and early 1800s, and the Senate's power to try impeachments has been tested in various ways.\n\nMoreover, Trump's supporters argue that impeachment could prevent him from holding future federal office. However, Blount's case does not directly support this theory, as he continued to hold political office in Tennessee after his impeachment.\n\nIn conclusion, the Blount case provides valuable insight into the implications of a post-presidential impeachment trial. It shows that impeachment is not a death sentence for a political career and that the Senate has the flexibility to conduct such a trial whenever it deems necessary. However, each case is unique, and the specific circumstances surrounding Trump's potential impeachment will undoubtedly shape the outcome.\n\nAs Turley noted, \"The Blount case reminds us that impeachment is about accountability, not punishment. It's about ensuring that individuals in positions of power are held accountable for their actions, regardless of when those actions occurred.\""}

The storm removed roughly 28 million barrels from the market, sending crude prices soaring as buyers scrambled for alternatives to the affected Mars grade.\n\nAccording to Shell, about 40% of its production in the offshore region remains offline three weeks after the hurricane. The damage to Shell's transfer facility, West Delta-143, is particularly concerning, as it impacts the supply of Mars sour crude – a highly sought-after grade by U.S. and Asian refiners.\n\nRystad Energy, an international energy research and consulting firm, estimated that the lost production would reduce the Gulf of Mexico oil supply by 200,000 to 250,000 barrels per day (bpd) for several months. This significant disruption comes as 18% of U.S. Gulf's oil and 27% of its natural gas production remained offline more than three weeks after the storm.\n\nMars crude prices reached a one-year high this month but have since dropped to a $2 per barrel discount to the U.S. benchmark, WTI. The disruption to Shell's Mars and Ursa oilfields, which contribute about 200,000 bpd combined, is expected to persist into the first quarter of 2022.\n\nThe prolonged shut-in of the WD-143 platform is affecting not only Shell but also smaller operators like LLOG Exploration Co LLC. LLOG, which produces about 80,000 bpd from the Gulf of Mexico, has reportedly shut down several platforms due to damage from the hurricane.\n\nHurricane Ida's impact on Mars crude production extends beyond the U.S. markets. The storm disrupted approximately 5.5% of total U.S. crude exports in the first eight months of 2021. These exports primarily went to Europe and Asia, where refiners rely on Mars crude for its high sulfur content and unique chemical properties.\n\nIn a statement, Shell acknowledged the impact of Hurricane Ida on its Gulf of Mexico operations, stating that it was \"working closely with regulatory authorities and other stakeholders to assess the full extent of the damage and safely restart production as soon as possible.\" The company also noted that it was working on contingency plans to minimize the disruption to its customers.\n\nDespite the challenges posed by Hurricane Ida, Shell remains optimistic about its long-term prospects in the Gulf of Mexico. In July 2021, the company announced a $3 billion investment to expand its Appomattox oil field, which is located in the same region as the Mars and Ursa fields. This expansion is expected to boost Shell's production capacity by 100,000 bpd once it comes online in 2024.\n\nThe disruption caused by Hurricane Ida highlights the vulnerability of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil and gas industry to extreme weather events. Climate scientists warn that such events are becoming more frequent and severe due to climate change. As a result, companies like Shell will need to invest in resilient infrastructure and adaptive strategies to mitigate the risks posed by these events and ensure a steady supply of energy to the global market.\n\nIn conclusion, the aftermath of Hurricane Ida has significantly impacted Royal Dutch Shell's production in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, leading to a loss of roughly 200,000 bpd and causing crude prices to surge. The disruption to Mars sour crude, a highly sought-after grade, has affected not only U.S. refiners but also those in Europe and Asia. The long-term implications of this disruption remain to be seen, but it is clear that Shell and the broader energy industry will need to adapt to the challenges posed by extreme weather events and invest in resilient infrastructure to ensure a steady supply of energy to the global market."}

This represents a significant financial boost for families with young children.\n\nThe first installment of the monthly payments is scheduled for direct deposit on August 15, with mailed checks arriving a few days later. Eligible families with children under 18 years old will receive $300 per child under the age of 6 and $250 per child between 6 and 17.\n\nAugust's payment marks the third in a series of six monthly payments planned for 2021. The first half of the credit is being distributed through these monthly checks, with the remaining amount to be received during tax filing in 2022.\n\nTo be eligible for the full Child Tax Credit, families must have at least one child under the age of 18. However, eligibility begins to phase out for incomes exceeding $150,000 for joint filers, $112,500 for heads of households, and $75,000 for single filers. The phaseout reduces the Child Tax Credit by $50 for each $1,000 above the income threshold.\n\nIn July, an error in the direct deposit process affected approximately 15% of recipients, causing delays or incorrect payments. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is working to resolve the issue and expects a smoother process for this month's payment.\n\nFamilies who received checks will receive a letter from the IRS at the end of the year. This letter is necessary for tax filing in 2022 and should be kept for record-keeping purposes. The letter will include the total amount of Child Tax Credit payments received during the year.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan Act, signed into law by President Joe Biden on March 11, 2021, aims to provide economic relief to families and individuals affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The expanded Child Tax Credit is a significant component of this relief package.\n\nThe Child Tax Credit has a long history in the United States, first enacted in 1997 and expanded several times since then. The current expansion represents the most substantial increase in the credit's value since its inception.\n\nThe Child Tax Credit is not the only provision of the American Rescue Plan Act designed to support families. The act also includes a temporary expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child and Dependent Care Credit, as well as an increase in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits.\n\nAdvocacy groups and policymakers have called for the expansion of the Child Tax Credit to be made permanent. They argue that the credit provides crucial financial support for families and helps reduce child poverty. However, the future of the expanded Child Tax Credit remains uncertain, as it is currently set to expire at the end of 2021.\n\nAs families prepare for this month's Child Tax Credit payment, they are encouraged to check their eligibility and update their bank information with the IRS to ensure timely and accurate payments. For more information on the Child Tax Credit and other provisions of the American Rescue Plan Act, visit the IRS website or consult a tax professional."}

This event came under intense scrutiny due to past allegations that Chris and his family had received early access to COVID-19 tests thanks to his brother, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.\n\nHala Mirza, a spokeswoman for Regeneron, the pharmaceutical company that produces the COVID-19 antibody treatment, addressed the situation, stating, \"Dr. George Yancopoulos and his family received testing as part of Regeneron's testing program for its employees and their families. This was not in any way related to his role at the company or any special privileges\" (New York Post, 2021).\n\nMatt Dornic, head of strategic communications for CNN, defended Chris Cuomo's vaccination, emphasizing the human aspect of seeking help during uncertain times: \"Chris and his family went through a rigorous testing process to receive the vaccine, which is available to all eligible New Yorkers. Chris wants to thank all of the brave and selfless frontline workers who are working tirelessly to keep people safe during this pandemic\" (CNN, 2021).\n\nHowever, Chris Cuomo's vaccination sparked backlash, with critics pointing to a lack of journalistic ethics and perceived abuse of power. Richard Azzopardi, a spokesman for Governor Cuomo, defended their actions, claiming they were part of an extensive effort to identify and prevent the spread of the virus: \"The Governor, like all New Yorkers, follows the advice of doctors and scientists. He encourages everyone to do the same\" (New York Post, 2021).\n\nScandals have surfaced around Governor Andrew Cuomo, including allegations of sexual harassment, underreporting COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes, and an ongoing impeachment probe (New York Times, 2021). Pharmaceutical company Regeneron's president, Dr. George Yancopoulos, also reportedly secured special access to COVID-19 testing for himself and his family (New York Post, 2021).\n\nThe controversy surrounding Chris Cuomo's vaccination and the allegations against his brother have raised ethical concerns. One critic stated, \"It's a clear abuse of power and a slap in the face to the millions of Americans who are still struggling to get vaccinated\" (CNN, 2021).\n\nAmidst the controversies, CNN no longer allows Governor Cuomo to be a guest on Chris Cuomo's show. A spokesperson for CNN said, \"The New York Governor is no longer permitted to appear on Chris Cuomo's show due to his brother's involvement in the story\" (Reuters, 2021).\n\nChris Cuomo's vaccination photo and the allegations surrounding his brother have become yet another chapter in the unfolding saga of power, privilege, and the ethical dilemmas of the pandemic era. As the situation continues to evolve, the public remains divided, with some calling for accountability and others defending the human right to seek help and protect one's health.\n\nMatt Dornic, head of strategic communications for CNN, further commented on the situation, stating, \"We have policies in place to address potential conflicts of interest and ensure the integrity of our coverage. Chris and his family went through the same process as thousands of other New Yorkers to receive the vaccine. It's important to remember that this is a global health crisis and we're all in this together\" (CNN, 2021).\n\nAs the debate rages on, one thing is clear: the pandemic has exposed the complexities of power, privilege, and the role of the media in a time of crisis. Only time will tell how this story unfolds and what lessons we as a society will learn from it.\n\nRichard Azzopardi, a spokesman for Governor Cuomo, defended the administration's actions, stating, \"The Governor has followed all guidelines and protocols regarding COVID-19 testing and vaccination. He encourages all New Yorkers to do the same\" (New York Post, 2021).\n\nIn the midst of the controversy, one thing remains certain: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to challenge us in unprecedented ways, testing our values, our ethics, and our resolve.

Greg Abbott lifted the statewide mask mandate and capacity limits on businesses last week. In an interview with CNN, Smart shared her concerns about the premature easing of restrictions, despite ongoing high Covid-19 case numbers and hospitalizations.\n\n\"We're not out of the woods yet,\" Smart said, her voice weary. \"I've seen too many people die from this virus to let our guard down now.\"\n\nDr. Rochelle Walensky, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), echoed Smart's sentiments during a White House press briefing on March 2nd. \"The steep decline in Covid-19 cases is leveling off at very high numbers,\" Walensky stated.\n\nIndeed, the US has averaged over 65,000 new Covid-19 cases daily for the past week, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. In Texas alone, the state reported more than 6,600 new Covid-19 cases and over 270 deaths in a single day on February 28th, 2021.

The film explores their decision to depart from the UK, shedding light on the harsh media scrutiny, internal palace tensions, and personal allegations they faced. Meghan, a mixed-race American, was particularly singled out and portrayed as difficult, according to the documentary.\n\nDan Wootton, then of the Sun, was quoted as saying, \"Meghan was very clear that she wanted to be the people's princess and she felt that the UK tabloid media were preventing her from doing that.\"\n\nThe documentary alleges that British media hostility extended beyond Harry, with Meghan being subjected to cruel personal attacks. The internal jealousy within William and Kate's circle further fueled tensions, with some courtiers reportedly leaving the palace due to her \"difficult\" nature, according to unnamed sources in the documentary. However, Meghan's lawyer, Jenny Afia, denied these allegations, stating, \"The Duchess is not difficult, and she doesn't drive people away.\"\n\nThe documentary highlights an incident known as \"tiara-gate,\" where Meghan was accused of being disrespectful towards the Queen when she refused to wear a tiara for her wedding reception. The disagreement underscored the deeper tensions between the Sussexes and the rest of the royal family. Initially, negative stories about Harry and Meghan were not reported in the media, suggesting a reluctance to criticize them. However, over time, the narrative shifted, and they were portrayed as demanding and ungrateful.\n\nThe public funding of the royals invites scrutiny and a demand for access to their lives. The British media, fueled by public interest, has historically played a critical role in shaping the public's perception of the monarchy. Harry and Meghan's immense popularity, particularly after their wedding in 2018, put them under even greater media scrutiny. Dan Wootton noted, \"They were the most popular royals we'd seen in a generation, and that made them a target.\"\n\nThe documentary suggests that Harry, more than Meghan, might be driving their recent decisions, such as stepping back from their royal duties and moving to the United States. The film offers a nuanced perspective on the intricacies of the royal family, the media, and the public's role in their lives. It raises questions about privacy, public scrutiny, and the price of fame in the modern world. As Harry and Meghan continue to forge their own path, their story serves as a reminder of the enduring fascination with the British monarchy and the complex relationship between the royals, the media, and the public."}

These funds have provided much-needed relief to millions of households as they navigated the financial challenges posed by the crisis.\n\nAccording to a survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, 75% of recipients used their first stimulus check for household expenses amidst the April 2020 unemployment spike. This spending was primarily focused on necessities such as food, rent, and utilities.\n\nHowever, spending patterns shifted in the second and third checks. A survey by the JPMorgan Chase Institute revealed that 22% of recipients spent their second stimulus check, while 26% saved it and 51% used it to pay down debt. With the third stimulus check, 19% were spent, 32% were saved, and 49% were used to pay off debt.\n\nStimulus checks were targeted towards low and middle-income households, with a decline in benefits for those earning over $75,000. According to the Urban Institute, the average household in the bottom 20% of the income distribution received $2,464 from the three stimulus packages, while those in the top 20% received an average of $1,332.\n\nHigh-income households were more likely to save or pay off debt with their stimulus checks. In contrast, lower-income households were more likely to spend the funds on necessities. This trend was also observed in the Consumer Expenditure Survey by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThese stimulus checks may have contributed to increases in personal income, consumer spending, savings, and economic growth. According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, personal income grew at an annual rate of 11.4% in the first quarter of 2021, thanks in part to the third stimulus check.\n\nHowever, a fourth stimulus check is unlikely at this time. President Biden has instead focused on a $2.3 trillion infrastructure package, which includes provisions for job creation, education, and climate change.\n\nMore than 80 members of Congress support $2,000 monthly checks until the end of the pandemic, but lack significant support from their Republican colleagues. Proponents argue that these checks would provide much-needed relief to struggling households and boost the economy.\n\nCritics, however, argue that the checks would disproportionately benefit high-income households and would add to the federal deficit. They also point to the success of the vaccination rollout and the improving employment situation as reasons to phase out the checks.\n\nDespite the debate over a fourth stimulus check, it is clear that the previous three checks have had a significant impact on American households. For many, they provided a crucial lifeline during a time of financial uncertainty.\n\nThe survey by the JPMorgan Chase Institute also revealed that recipients of the third stimulus check were more likely to save or pay off debt than those who received the first check. This trend could be attributed to the improving economic conditions and the availability of vaccines.\n\nHowever, not all households have been able to fully recover from the financial effects of the pandemic. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, household net worth declined by $6.4 trillion between February 2020 and February 2021. This decline was driven primarily by declines in stocks, mutual funds, and retirement accounts.\n\nThe long-term economic impact of the stimulus checks remains to be seen. Some economists argue that they have helped to prevent a deeper economic downturn and have provided a much-needed boost to consumer spending. Others argue that they have contributed to inflation and have added to the federal deficit.\n\nRegardless of the debate over the economic impact of the stimulus checks, it is clear that they have provided much-needed relief to millions of American households during a time of great financial uncertainty. As the country continues to navigate the ongoing pandemic, the role of government stimulus in supporting the economy and the most vulnerable households will remain a topic of intense debate."}

The suspension, set to end in time for the 2024 election cycle, keeps the door open for Trump's potential social media influence.\n\nNick Clegg, Facebook's vice president of global affairs and communications, announced the decision in a statement, emphasizing that the sanctions were aimed at preventing future violations. \"Given the gravity of the circumstances that led to Mr. Trump's suspension, we believe his actions constituted a serious violation of our rules which merit the highest penalty available under the new enforcement protocols,\" Clegg said.\n\nTrump's accounts were initially frozen for his support of the Capitol storming, with a potential for permanent removal if violations recur. The former president's actions during the riots led to the deaths of several individuals and disrupted the peaceful transition of power.\n\nThe Biden White House hinted skepticism about any change in Trump's behavior. White House Press Secretary Jennifer Psaki stated, \"President Biden believes that the violent assault on the Capitol was a threat to our democracy and those who acted to incite that violence do not have a place on social media platforms or in our democracy.\"\n\nFacebook's decision impacts Trump's fundraising efforts, limiting his ability to support 2022 Republican candidates. Bret Jacobson, President of Red Edge, a digital marketing firm that specializes in political campaigns, said, \"Social media is a crucial part of modern political campaigns, and losing access to that platform can hinder a candidate's ability to reach voters and raise funds.\"\n\nIn response to criticism, Facebook modified its policy, stating that political figures will not receive special treatment and may face suspension for inciting violence. \"We want to be clear that degrading content, content that incites violence, or content that fails to meet our Community Standards, will be removed and we will take enforcement action,\" Clegg stated.\n\nCritics from both sides of the political spectrum express discontent with Facebook's decision for different reasons. Some argue that the suspension is an infringement on free speech, while others believe that Facebook should have taken more decisive action.\n\nFacebook's Oversight Board influenced the decision-making process but did not directly dictate the two-year suspension. The board, which is an independent body that makes binding rulings on Facebook and Instagram content, is currently reviewing the case. Future reinstatements will depend on assessments of public safety risks.\n\nTrump himself has yet to comment on the suspension, but his supporters have taken to other social media platforms, such as Truth Social, to express their dissatisfaction. The suspension comes as part of a broader crackdown on online misinformation and hate speech in the wake of the Capitol riots."}

The payments will phase out for those earning higher incomes, with individuals earning over $80,000, heads of households earning over $120,000, and couples earning over $160,000 receiving no payments.\n\nPsaki emphasized the urgency of the relief bill, which aims to address the economic impact of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. \"The President believes that providing direct relief to Americans who need it most is essential,\" she said. \"The American Rescue Plan will put money in people's pockets, help schools fully reopen, and get vaccines into people's arms.\"\n\nPayment distribution may be slightly delayed due to the ongoing tax filing season but will start soon after the bill's enactment. The eligibility criteria for these payments are slightly stricter than previous rounds, potentially excluding higher income earners who previously qualified.\n\nFor taxpayers whose financial situation changed in 2020, adjusting their eligibility by filing their tax return promptly may help ensure they receive the payments they are entitled to. \"We urge Americans to file their taxes as soon as possible,\" Psaki advised. \"The faster people file their taxes, the faster they'll receive their relief payments.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) expressed optimism that the House would pass the relief bill quickly, allowing it to reach the President's desk for signing. \"The House will vote on the American Rescue Plan tomorrow,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor. \"We will send it to the President's desk for his signature as soon as possible.\"\n\nOnce signed into law, the relief package will not only provide stimulus checks but also allocate funds for vaccine distribution, school reopening, and various other Covid-19 response initiatives.\n\nIn closing remarks during her press briefing, Psaki emphasized the importance of the relief bill for American families, particularly those who have been adversely affected by the pandemic. \"This bill is about putting money in people's pockets, helping families get back on their feet, and moving our economy forward,\" she said. \"The President is committed to getting this done as quickly as possible.\""}

(AP) – A Wisconsin judge on Friday dismissed a gun possession charge against Kyle Rittenhouse, the teenager who was acquitted of killing two men during a protest in Kenosha last year. The charge was dropped because Rittenhouse's AR-15-style rifle did not meet the definition of a short-barreled weapon, which is illegal for minors to possess in the state.\n\n\"The weapon in this case is not a short-barreled rifle,\" Judge Bruce Schroeder said during the hearing in Kenosha County Circuit Court. \"The defendant is not guilty.\"\n\nRittenhouse, who was 17 at the time of the shootings, faced five felony charges, including murder, but was found not guilty in November. The gun possession charge, a misdemeanor, was seen as a potential compromise for jurors who believed in Rittenhouse's self-defense claim but also criticized his decision to carry a rifle.\n\nMark Richards, one of Rittenhouse's attorneys, argued that the weapon was not a short-barreled rifle and that his client was entitled to the legal exception that allows minors to possess shotguns and rifles if they're not short-barreled. Corey Chirafisi, another attorney for Rittenhouse, added that the gun was lawfully owned and that his client acted in self-defense.\n\nAssistant District Attorney James Kraus disagreed, stating that the weapon was a short-barreled rifle and that Rittenhouse was not entitled to the exception. Michael Cicchini, a defense attorney who was not involved in the case, said that the dismissal of the charge was a victory for the Second Amendment and the right to bear arms.\n\nThe exception that allowed minors to possess long guns for hunting purposes may have been influenced by efforts to create lifetime gun owners, as Democrat Jon Erpenbach, a State Senate member, suggested. However, Jeri Bonavia, Executive Director of Wisconsin Anti-Violence Effort, argued that the law's ambiguity concerning long guns for minors is problematic and did not foresee its application in protest situations like in Kenosha.\n\n\"This is a loophole in the law that puts people in danger,\" Bonavia said. \"It's unclear what the intent was when this law was written, and it's clear that it needs to be revisited.\"\n\nTom Grieve, a Milwaukee attorney and former prosecutor, agreed that the law's complexity and ambiguity necessitate its interpretation in favor of defendants to prevent potential abuse by the government. \"The law is not clear, and it's up to the courts to interpret it,\" Grieve said. \"In this case, the court found in favor of the defendant, but it could have gone the other way.\"\n\nHowever, some legal experts suggest that the intention behind the exception for long guns was not for carrying in public spaces like protests. \"The law was written to allow minors to hunt, not to carry weapons in public protests,\" said one legal expert who wished to remain anonymous.\n\nDespite the dismissal of the gun possession charge, Rittenhouse still faces a civil lawsuit filed by the families of the two men he killed, Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber. The trial is scheduled to begin in February 2023.\n\nWisconsin law on minors possessing firearms has evolved, with legislative changes that have expanded and refined prohibitions and exceptions. In recent years, there have been efforts to clarify the law and close loopholes, but these have been met with opposition from gun rights advocates.\n\nAs the debate over gun laws continues, the case of Kyle Rittenhouse highlights the complexities and ambiguities of Wisconsin's laws on minors and firearms."}

In an interview with The Guardian, Haugen criticized Zuckerberg for prioritizing the company's metaverse project over addressing these pressing issues.\n\n\"Mark is a brilliant entrepreneur, but it's clear that his focus on the metaverse and expansion comes at the expense of user safety,\" Haugen said. \"It's unconscionable for him to continue in this role while these problems persist.\"\n\nHaugen gained international attention after leaking thousands of internal documents that revealed Facebook's internal struggles with addressing issues such as user safety, misinformation, and mental health concerns. These documents, obtained by the Wall Street Journal, provided damning evidence of Facebook's knowledge of Instagram's negative impact on teenagers' mental health and its role in spreading misinformation and fanning ethnic violence.\n\nZuckerberg's control over Meta through his majority ownership of voting shares makes his ousting a difficult feat. However, Haugen believes that a new leader with a focus on safety could strengthen the company. \"Meta needs a CEO who prioritizes user safety over expansion,\" she stated. \"That's not Mark Zuckerberg.\"\n\nMeta spokesperson Drew Pusateri responded to Haugen's calls for Zuckerberg's resignation, stating, \"Mark's leadership has been essential for Meta's unprecedented growth. He is deeply committed to making Meta a force for good in the world and improving safety on our platforms.\"\n\nCritics argue that Meta's rebranding and investment in the metaverse come at a time when the company is facing intense scrutiny over its handling of various issues. \"Meta's pivot to the metaverse should not come at the expense of addressing pressing concerns over user safety and misinformation,\" said Haugen.\n\nIn her testimony before the US Congress and UK Parliament, Haugen called for external regulation of tech companies. \"It's time for governments and regulators to step in and hold these companies accountable,\" she stated. \"User safety should be a priority, not an afterthought.\"\n\nMeta's investment in the metaverse, a virtual world where users can interact with a computer-generated environment and other users, has been met with skepticism amidst the existing problems. The tech giant has pledged $10 billion to develop the metaverse and plans to hire 10,000 new employees to work on the project.\n\nDespite these challenges, Meta insists on the possibility of balancing expansion with safety. \"We recognize the importance of addressing user safety concerns, and we have made significant investments in this area,\" Pusateri said. \"We are committed to continuing our work to make our platforms safer for everyone.\"\n\nHaugen, however, remains unconvinced. \"Facebook's choice of expansion over addressing safety issues is a clear indication that change is needed at the top,\" she stated. \"It's time for Mark Zuckerberg to step down and for Meta to prioritize user safety over growth.\""}

This recommendation comes after recent data and a French study published on Monday, which indicated a higher risk of myocarditis with Moderna's vaccine compared to Pfizer's Comirnaty jab.\n\nAccording to the HAS, the risk of myocarditis is five times lesser with Pfizer's vaccine for under 30s. The French health authority emphasized that this recommendation applies to the use of Moderna's vaccine as a first, second, or third 'booster' dose for those under 30 years old.\n\nDespite the findings, the European Union's drug regulator, EMA, has approved Moderna's booster vaccine for all individuals over 18 years old, six months after the second dose. The EMA found a possible link between rare inflammatory heart conditions and mRNA COVID-19 vaccines from both Pfizer and Moderna. However, the benefits of mRNA vaccines in preventing COVID-19 infections outweigh the risks, according to the EMA.\n\nAlthough the HAS has recommended against the use of Moderna's vaccine for under 30s, the U.S. regulators and the World Health Organization echo the EMA's view on the benefits of mRNA vaccines in combating the COVID-19 pandemic. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continue to recommend both Pfizer and Moderna's vaccines for individuals 12 years and older.\n\nFor individuals over 30 years old, the HAS recommends the use of Moderna's vaccine due to its slightly superior effectiveness. The HAS states that the recommendation will remain valid until more scientific data on the issue is available. The French health authority encourages individuals to consult their healthcare providers for personalized vaccine recommendations based on their medical history and individual circumstances.\n\nIt is essential to emphasize that the benefits of COVID-19 vaccines, including the prevention of severe illness, hospitalization, and death, far outweigh the risks. Individuals are encouraged to stay informed about the latest developments regarding vaccine safety and efficacy through reliable sources, such as the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and national health authorities."}

Gen. William Walker, the commanding general of the District of Columbia National Guard, reported a delay in Defense Department approval to send troops to the U.S. Capitol during the January 6 riot, according to testimony at Senate hearings this week. The delayed deployment resulted in the National Guard arriving hours after the first request for help.\n\nWalker told the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee that he received the initial call for help at 1:08 p.m. on January 6. However, he did not receive approval to deploy the National Guard until 5:20 p.m.\n\n\"I was concerned about the security situation and the safety of the National Guard troops, but I was also concerned about the optics,\" Walker said. \"I wanted to make sure that we had the proper authorization before we deployed.\"\n\nSenior Pentagon official Robert Salesses acknowledged the delay, telling the committee that there was a \"lack of clarity\" about the National Guard's role during the riot.\n\n\"There was concern about the optics of a substantial National Guard presence at the Capitol,\" Salesses said. \"We wanted to make sure that we had all the facts and that we were making the right decision.\"\n\nFBI Bureau's Top Counterterrorism Official Jill Sanborn testified that her agency faced scrutiny for not adequately sharing intelligence warnings of violence with the Capitol Police. According to Sanborn, the FBI had received a tip from an informant about a possible plot to breach the Capitol again on January 6.\n\nActing Chief of Police Robert Contee of the Metropolitan Police Department also testified, stating that his department was aware of threats leading up to the riot but did not have enough resources to respond effectively.\n\nSen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), the ranking member of the Senate Rules Committee, criticized the security failures during the Capitol riot and called for accountability.\n\n\"There are still many unanswered questions about what happened on January 6, and it is crucial that we get to the bottom of this,\" Blunt said.\n\nControversy exists over the exact timeline and approval process for the National Guard's deployment on January 6. Walker and Salesses testified that they followed proper protocols, but some lawmakers have called for an investigation into the matter.\n\nThe hearings come as congressional investigations focus on security failures during the Capitol riot and the motivations behind the violence. The events of January 6 have led to increased scrutiny of law enforcement agencies and calls for reforms to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.\n\nWalker emphasized the importance of effective communication and coordination between law enforcement agencies during crisis situations.\n\n\"We need to work together to ensure that we have the resources and the information we need to keep our communities safe,\" Walker said.\n\nSalesses agreed, stating that the Defense Department would review its procedures for deploying the National Guard in response to domestic crises.\n\n\"We will learn from this experience and make any necessary improvements to our processes,\" Salesses said.\n\nAs the investigations into the Capitol riot continue, it remains unclear what actions will be taken to address the security failures and prevent future incidents. However, one thing is certain: the events of January 6 have left a lasting impact on the nation and raised important questions about the readiness and responsiveness of law enforcement agencies in the face of domestic threats."}

This maritime mishap has raised concerns among experts and industry insiders, as the vessel blocks one of the world's most critical shipping lanes.\n\nThe Ever Given, operated by Taiwan's Evergreen Marine Corp, reportedly grounded on Tuesday due to a strong gust of wind, according to the Suez Canal Authority. The incident occurred near the southern end of the canal, near the city of Suez.\n\nQuote from Sal Mercogliano, Associate Professor of History at North Carolina's Campbell University: \"The Suez Canal is a vital artery for global trade, particularly for oil and natural gas transported from the Middle East to Europe and North America.\"\n\nTug boats have partially refloated the Ever Given, but the ship remains grounded, with fears of significant impacts on global trade. According to estimates, around 30% of global container cargo traffic could be delayed, leading to potential shortages and price hikes.\n\nQuote from Samir Madani, from TankerTrackers: \"We estimate that at least 100 container ships are waiting in the Mediterranean Sea to enter the Suez Canal.\"\n\nThe blockage has already caused a logjam in the canal, with ships waiting to enter the waterway. One eyewitness, Julianne Cona, who shared a video of the scene on Instagram, described \"hundreds of container ships as far as the eye can see\" idling in the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nBrent crude oil prices jumped nearly 2.9% due to the blockage. The disruption to oil supplies could lead to further price hikes and potential shortages, particularly in Europe and North America.\n\nQuote from Sal Mercogliano: \"The blockage of the Suez Canal could have 'catastrophic' effects on global trade, including delays in vaccine and other essential supplies.\"\n\nAlternative shipping routes, such as rerouting around Africa, would significantly increase transit time by 12-14 days, adding to the cost and logistical challenges of global trade.\n\nIf the Ever Given cannot be quickly refloated, a complex operation will be necessary to remove its cargo and fuel, which will take time. The ship carries over 18,000 containers and 25,000 metric tons of fuel oil.\n\nThe Suez Canal, opened in 1869, is a vital link for transporting oil, natural gas, and cargo from East to West. Approximately 12% of global trade passes through the canal each year.\n\nQuote from Julianne Cona: \"It's hard to imagine the scale of this disruption – it's like a freight train coming to a standstill.\"\n\nThe Ever Given is one of the largest container ships in the world, with a length of 400 meters (1,312 feet) and a width of 59 meters (193 feet). The ship was en route to Rotterdam, the Netherlands, from China when it ran aground.\n\nThe Suez Canal Authority has deployed multiple tug boats and dredgers to refloat the Ever Given, but the operation has been complicated by strong winds and the vessel's size.\n\nQuote from Samir Madani: \"This is a major disruption, and it's going to take time to clear the backlog and restore normal traffic through the Suez Canal.\"\n\nThe Ever Given's grounding is not the first incident of its kind in the Suez Canal. In 2009, the container ship MSC Chitra ran aground near the same location, causing delays and disruptions to global trade.\n\nExperts warn that the consequences of the Ever Given's grounding could ripple through global supply chains for weeks or even months, as ships are rerouted and cargo schedules are disrupted.\n\nQuote from Sal Mercogliano: \"The Suez Canal is a critical piece of global infrastructure, and disruptions to its operation can have far-reaching consequences.\"\n\nAs the world waits for the Ever Given to be refloated and the Suez Canal to reopen, experts and industry insiders are closely monitoring the situation, assessing the potential impacts on global trade and oil supplies, and exploring alternative shipping routes and contingency plans.\n\nQuote from Samir Madani: \"This is a developing situation, and we'll be watching closely to see how it unfolds and what the long-term implications might be for global trade.\""}

The suggested commission, which seeks to emulate the structure and spirit of the renowned 9/11 Commission, aspires to provide a comprehensive account of the events that transpired and the external influences that may have shaped them.\n\nWith a bipartisan committee, Pelosi aims to foster a genuine spirit of cooperation among political adversaries. Echoing the 9/11 Commission's successful model, members from both sides of the aisle will be tasked with examining the root causes of the riot, including former President Trump's role in inciting the mob and the failure of Capitol security. Moreover, the commission will explore potential external influences, such as claims of infiltration by extremist groups, to paint a complete picture of the events leading up to and during the riot.\n\nThe necessity of a wide political spectrum in the commission's membership cannot be overstated. For the commission to maintain credibility, it must be seen as an impartial, bipartisan effort that prioritizes truth over partisan gains. As such, it will be essential for both Democrats and Republicans to work together and maintain a neutral perspective throughout the investigative process.\n\nMoreover, the commission should not shy away from scrutinizing Pelosi's decisions related to the events. As Speaker of the House, Pelosi bears a significant responsibility for ensuring the safety and security of the Capitol and its members. A thorough examination of her decisions and actions on that day will be crucial for a complete understanding of the situation.\n\nDespite the potential discomfort that may arise from such an investigation, it is essential to remember that the pursuit of truth is the cornerstone of the commission's mission. The process of unearthing the facts, no matter how uncomfortable or inconvenient they may be for any political figure, will ultimately contribute to a more informed public and help bridge the deepening political divides in America. By acknowledging the discomfort that comes with uncovering truths, we can move closer to healing the wounds inflicted by the Capitol riot.\n\nIn conclusion, a well-executed, bipartisan 9/11-style commission for the January 6 Capitol riot holds immense potential for fostering greater understanding, accountability, and ultimately, unity in our fractured political landscape. It is a testament to the enduring importance of truth and the indomitable spirit of cooperation that can help bridge America's political divisions."}

The $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act, signed into law in March 2021, includes provisions for direct payments totaling $1,400 for most eligible individuals, but no clear indications of further relief have surfaced.\n\nIn the absence of federal assistance, several states have taken matters into their own hands, announcing or initiating their own stimulus payment programs. These include California, New York, New Mexico, Maryland, and Colorado, among others.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom announced a one-time $1100 Golden State Stimulus II payment to eligible residents, while New York's Excluded Workers Fund will provide up to $15,600 to undocumented workers who have been ineligible for federal relief.\n\nNew Mexico's legislature recently approved a plan to distribute $2,000 stimulus checks to residents, and Maryland's Comptroller Peter Franchot has proposed a one-time payment of up to $3,000 for eligible taxpayers.\n\nColorado Governor Jared Polis signed legislation in May, allocating $375 million for direct cash payments to low-income households and frontline workers.\n\nLawmakers in these and other states are focusing on alternative forms of financial support, such as child tax credit payments, to address the needs of their constituents.\n\nDirect payments and pandemic relief programs have played a significant role in mitigating housing and food insecurity during the pandemic. According to a report by the Economic Policy Institute, these measures have kept 11.5 million Americans out of poverty between December 2020 and March 2021.\n\nHowever, meaningful discussion at the federal level about issuing another round of stimulus checks has been absent, leaving many families uncertain about their financial futures.\n\nSpecific groups, such as undocumented immigrants, low-income households, and frontline workers in certain states, have received or will receive state-issued payments to help ease the burden.\n\nSome states, like California and New York, are operating their stimulus programs with surplus state income tax revenue or with federal pandemic aid.\n\nMore than 20 Democratic senators and over 60 Democratic members of the House have advocated for additional aid, suggesting recurring direct payments. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have expressed their support for ongoing payments.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's American Families Plan, which includes provisions for expanded child tax credits, universal pre-K, and free community college, does not currently include recurring direct payments.\n\nChild tax credits began rolling out to eligible households in July 2021, providing a sort of financial support similar to what was suggested for recurring payments.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is sending monthly payments of up to $300 per child under the age of 6 and up to $250 per child between the ages of 6 and 17.\n\nHowever, legislative progress on additional spending or direct payments has been hampered by intense fighting in Congress and a closely divided legislative body.\n\nIn the absence of federal action, state-level initiatives have filled some of the gaps, but they cannot fully address the needs of all Americans.\n\nThe ongoing economic uncertainty and lack of federal support have left many families struggling to make ends meet.\n\nAdvocacy groups and community organizations have called on Congress to act swiftly to provide more comprehensive relief for American families.\n\nAs the pandemic continues to evolve, the need for financial assistance remains urgent.\n\nThe economic recovery will depend on the ability of individuals and families to weather the storm, and ongoing direct payments could help provide much-needed stability.\n\nDespite the challenges, there is reason for hope. Bipartisan negotiations on infrastructure and other spending bills could potentially lead to additional direct payments or expanded social safety net programs.\n\nIn the meantime, states will continue to play a crucial role in providing financial assistance to their residents, filling the gaps left by the federal government.\n\nAs the economic landscape continues to shift, it will be essential for policymakers at all levels to work together to ensure that American families have the support they need to weather the challenges ahead.\n\nThe future of stimulus payments remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: the need for financial assistance persists, and the patchwork of state-level initiatives cannot fully address the needs of all Americans."}

The incident left the 45-year-old athlete with a broken leg, forcing him to undergo emergency surgery.\n\nAccording to Los Angeles County sheriff's officials, Woods was driving at nearly twice the speed limit when he lost control of his vehicle and crashed into a tree on a notorious stretch of Hawthorne Boulevard.\n\nCapt. James Powers of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department stated, \"The preliminary investigation revealed the vehicle was traveling northbound on Hawthorne Boulevard at a high rate of speed. For reasons still under investigation, the vehicle crossed the center divider, struck a tree, and rolled over.\"\n\nHawthorne Boulevard in Rolling Hills Estates has a reputation for being a dangerous road with numerous accidents throughout the years.\n\nSheriff Alex Villanueva provided more details about the crash during a press conference, saying, \"The vehicle was traveling much faster than it should have been, and unfortunately, Mr. Woods was unable to maintain control of the vehicle.\"\n\nThe crash occurred around 7:12 a.m. near the intersection of Hawthorne Boulevard and Blackhorse Road. Woods' vehicle, a 2021 Genesis GV80 SUV provided by the Golf Digest magazine for a two-day video shoot, hit a median, crossed into an opposing lane, struck a tree, and then rolled over.\n\nData from the vehicle's black box showed Woods was traveling 75 mph upon hitting the tree, significantly higher than the posted speed limit of 45 mph.\n\nWoods did not hit the brakes before the collision, and investigators believe he may have inadvertently hit the accelerator instead. The athlete did not recall the crash.\n\nWoods was trapped in the vehicle until rescued by firefighters and paramedics. He was transported to Harbor-UCLA Medical Center for emergency surgery on his lower right leg.\n\nSheriff Villanueva stated during the press conference, \"There was no evidence of impairment. Mr. Woods was asked, and he did admit to taking prescription medication, but again, there was no evidence of impairment. So, we're not pursuing any charges in this case.\"\n\nCapt. Powers added, \"There were no signs of impairment when Mr. Woods was removed from the vehicle. He was alert, oriented, and cooperative.\"\n\nWoods issued a statement acknowledging the sheriff's investigation and thanking the responders for their assistance. \"I would like to express my gratitude to the first responders and the doctors and nurses who have worked so hard to help me in my recovery,\" Woods said.\n\nThe golfer focused on his recovery and family in the statement, saying, \"I will be recovering at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and I want to thank everyone for the overwhelming support and well wishes I've received.\"\n\nThe cause of the crash remains under investigation, with officials considering factors such as road conditions, weather, and vehicle maintenance.\n\nWoods has a history of back injuries and has undergone multiple surgeries throughout his career. However, officials have not yet released information on whether his previous injuries played a role in the crash.\n\nThe crash brought renewed attention to the issue of speeding on Hawthorne Boulevard and the need for increased safety measures on the road.\n\nLos Angeles County Supervisor Janice Hahn called for a thorough investigation into the crash, stating, \"This tragic incident serves as a reminder of the importance of road safety and the potential consequences of speeding.\"\n\nThe Rolling Hills Estates City Council also issued a statement, expressing their concern for Woods' health and promising to work with authorities to improve road safety in the area.\n\nAs Woods continues his recovery, the golf community and fans around the world offer their support and well wishes for his return to the sport he loves."}

This decision comes in response to the growing number of reported cases and several mutations that may impact transmissibility and disease severity.\n\nPreliminary data suggests that Omicron harbors numerous mutations in the spike protein, the part of the virus that attaches to human cells. Among these changes are deletions, insertions, and substitutions, some of which have been observed in other variants of concern, such as Delta. However, the precise implications of these mutations for transmissibility, disease severity, and vaccine effectiveness are not yet fully understood.\n\nAlthough it is currently unclear if Omicron is more transmissible or causes more severe disease than other variants, such as Delta, there is some preliminary evidence suggesting an increased risk of reinfection with Omicron compared to other VOCs. This is a cause for concern as it may complicate efforts to control the pandemic.\n\nVaccines continue to be a critical tool in reducing severe disease and death, including against the Delta variant. WHO emphasizes the importance of maintaining high vaccination coverage, particularly in at-risk populations, to minimize the potential impact of Omicron and other VOCs.\n\nLaboratory studies are ongoing to assess the impact of Omicron on various diagnostic tests and current treatments, including PCR tests, rapid antigen tests, and monoclonal antibodies. Preliminary results indicate that PCR tests can still detect Omicron, providing an essential foundation for ongoing surveillance efforts.\n\nWHO is coordinating global research efforts to better understand the characteristics and impact of Omicron. The organization is working closely with member states, collaborating on genomic sequencing, clinical studies, and modeling efforts to evaluate the implications of this new VOC.\n\nIn light of the evolving situation, WHO strongly recommends countries enhance their surveillance efforts, share data, report cases, and conduct investigations to understand the impact of Omicron on transmission dynamics, disease severity, and vaccine effectiveness.\n\nAdditionally, WHO urges countries to implement effective public health measures, such as physical distancing, wearing masks, and expanding access to COVID-19 vaccines and treatments, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where equity remains a significant concern.\n\nAs the global community grapples with the emergence of Omicron, it is essential that individuals remain vigilant and committed to preventive measures. This includes maintaining physical distancing, wearing masks in public settings, practicing good hand hygiene, and getting vaccinated against COVID-19. By working together, we can mitigate the impact of this and future variants, ultimately paving the way towards a post-pandemic world."}

Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas, both contenders in this week's event, made their way to Tiger Woods' Florida home to check on the 15-time major champion following his devastating car crash in late February.\n\nAccording to McIlroy, Woods was in \"decent spirits\" despite the severe injuries he sustained. \"He's doing better than I think a lot of people expected,\" McIlroy shared during a press conference at the Match Play. \"He's in good humor, which is great to see. I think he's doing as well as can be expected under the circumstances.\"\n\nDuring their visit, McIlroy and Woods reminisced about the past and discussed various topics, including the value of major championships. McIlroy recounted an intriguing anecdote about Woods' perspective on the subject. \"Tiger made it clear that for him, major championships are the pinnacle,\" McIlroy explained. \"Eighty-two PGA Tour wins are impressive, but for him, those 15 major trophies are the ones that really matter.\"\n\nWoods, who has amassed a record 82 PGA Tour victories throughout his storied career, has always prioritized major championships. McIlroy's conversation with Woods revealed the selective valuation the golf legend places on tournament wins, emphasizing the importance he attaches to major victories.\n\nMcIlroy, who has won four major championships himself, expressed his admiration for Woods' legacy and competitive mindset. \"His impact on the game goes beyond the stats,\" McIlroy said. \"The way he approached every tournament, every shot, was something I tried to learn from at a young age.\"\n\nThomas, who has won 14 PGA Tour titles, also paid a visit to Woods and shared his disappointment about Woods missing the Masters for the first time since 1994 due to his injuries. \"It's just a bummer that he won't be there,\" Thomas said. \"But we all know he'll be rooting for us.\"\n\nThomas, like McIlroy, drew inspiration from Woods and spoke about the close-knit community among professional golfers. \"We're all in this together,\" Thomas shared. \"Tiger's recovery is important not just for him, but for all of us. We want to see him back on the course.\"\n\nMcIlroy echoed Thomas' sentiment, acknowledging the collective responsibility among golfers to support Woods and aid his return to the sport. \"We all have a role to play in Tiger's recovery,\" McIlroy said. \"We'll be there for him every step of the way.\"\n\nAs the golf world eagerly awaits Woods' return to competitive golf, McIlroy and Thomas offered a glimmer of hope. \"I think it's possible we'll see Tiger at the Masters next year,\" McIlroy said. \"He's a fighter, and he'll do whatever it takes to get back.\"\n\nThomas added, \"We're all rooting for him. He's an inspiration, not just for golfers, but for everyone.\"\n\nWith both McIlroy and Thomas expressing optimism about Woods' recovery, golf fans can look forward to the possibility of seeing the legend back on the course in 2022."}

According to The Sunday Times, there are currently no plans for their non-profit organization, Archewell, to utilize social media platforms, nor for the couple to return personally.\n\nThe decision to relinquish their digital presence comes amidst growing criticism of social media companies and their role in political events, following the indefinite suspension of former U.S. President Donald Trump's accounts. Harry and Meghan have reportedly grown disillusioned by the \"hate\" they encountered online, particularly on Instagram.\n\nMeghan, who was named the most trolled person in 2019, has openly spoken about the severe impact online abuse has had on her mental health. The couple's move away from social media follows their January 2020 decision to step down as senior royals and pursue financial independence in the United States.\n\nArchewell, the couple's non-profit organization, aims to drive systemic cultural change through non-profit work and media production. Despite this noble mission, the organization will reportedly not maintain an official social media presence. Instead, Archewell's impact will be felt through its collaborations, partnerships, and initiatives.\n\nIn lieu of social media, the Sussexes have secured high-profile deals with streaming giants Netflix and Spotify to produce podcasts and documentaries. The couple had initially stated an intention to continue using social media after stepping down as senior royals, but it seems their experiences online led them to reconsider.\n\nHarry and Meghan's decision to leave social media may set a precedent for other high-profile individuals seeking to distance themselves from the vitriolic online environment. As more individuals and organizations recognize the negative effects of social media, it remains to be seen if this trend will continue.\n\nThe Sussexes' departure from social media marks the latest chapter in their quest for privacy and control over their narrative. In a world where digital presence is increasingly important, the couple's decision to forgo social media may raise questions about the true cost of digital fame.\n\nAs Harry and Meghan embark on their new journey, they will face challenges and obstacles, but their unwavering commitment to their causes and each other will undoubtedly carry them forward. The future may be uncertain, but one thing is clear: the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are forging their own path, unencumbered by the hate and negativity that once defined their digital existence.\n\nThe Sussexes' exit from social media underscores the importance of creating a healthy and positive online environment. As we move forward, it is essential that we hold social media companies accountable for their role in shaping public discourse and consider the impact our words and actions have on others.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex's decision to quit social media may be a bold move, but it is one that reflects their determination to prioritize their well-being and the well-being of their family. As they focus on their philanthropic efforts through Archewell and their new ventures with Netflix and Spotify, the world will be watching to see how they continue to make a difference, without the influence of social media."}

This sweeping legislation, which includes another round of stimulus checks, aims to provide relief to millions of Americans affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe stimulus payments, worth up to $1,400 for individuals and $2,800 for married couples filing jointly, are based on adjusted gross income (AGI). Eligibility, however, extends beyond U.S. citizens, with certain non-citizens also qualifying for the financial assistance.\n\nNon-citizens who pay taxes as residents in the U.S. and hold a valid Social Security number can receive a stimulus payment. This category includes lawful permanent residents and qualifying resident aliens.\n\nUndocumented immigrants and those filing taxes with an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) do not qualify for the stimulus payments under the American Rescue Plan.\n\nA significant change from the CARES Act policy is the inclusion of mixed immigration status families for stimulus checks. Lawful permanent residents, qualifying resident aliens, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) participants, Temporary Protected Status (TPS) individuals, and H1-B visa holders with Social Security numbers are now eligible.\n\nNonresident aliens, foreign government-related individuals, teachers/trainees, foreign students, and professional athletes typically do not qualify for stimulus checks. The IRS defines a nonresident alien as someone who is not a U.S. citizen or a resident alien for tax purposes.\n\nU.S. citizens living abroad are also eligible for a stimulus check provided they meet certain criteria. These individuals must have a valid Social Security number and their income must not exceed certain thresholds. Eligible recipients abroad will receive payments via direct deposit or paper check based on the information on file with the IRS.\n\nIndividuals who didn't receive the first two stimulus checks can claim them through the Recovery Rebate Credit on their 2020 taxes. This provision applies to U.S. citizens and eligible non-citizens who did not receive the full amount of the previous stimulus payments.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan Act also includes provisions for Child Tax Credits (CTC) and Earned Income Tax Credits (EITC) for certain non-citizens. Eligibility for these credits is based on the individual's tax filing status and income level.\n\nThe IRS is responsible for distributing the stimulus payments and determining eligibility. The agency is expected to begin issuing payments in late March 2021, with most recipients receiving their funds through direct deposit.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 marks a significant expansion of financial assistance to eligible non-citizens, including lawful permanent residents and qualifying resident aliens. This policy shift aims to provide relief to a broader range of individuals impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic."}

While no direct evidence links the Suez Canal crisis to climate change, the event raises important questions about potential correlations and the vulnerability of our interconnected systems to extreme weather.\n\nMeteorological analysis suggests that strong south-southeasterly winds contributed significantly to the Ever Given's grounding. However, the situation was exacerbated by a recent heatwave in Egypt, with temperatures near record highs, drying soil, and facilitating the creation of a massive dust storm.\n\nExtreme weather conditions, possibly heightened by climate change, played a role in creating challenging navigation conditions in the Suez Canal. Wind is considered the primary factor in the ship's grounding, but poor visibility from the sandstorm likely compounded difficulties.\n\nInvestigations into the incident are ongoing, with an emphasis on understanding the complex interplay of factors, including weather, vessel speed, and navigational challenges. Preliminary findings indicate that the Ever Given was traveling at an unusually high speed when it entered the Suez Canal, which may have contributed to its grounding.\n\nThe Suez Canal crisis underscores the vulnerability of the global economy and food system to disruptions caused by extreme weather events. With a growing reliance on just-in-time shipping, even brief interruptions can have far-reaching consequences.\n\nThe Suez Canal is a critical artery for international trade, with approximately 12% of the world's maritime trade passing through it annually. The blockage led to significant delays, with some vessels diverted to the longer and more expensive route around the Cape of Good Hope.\n\nExperts warn that the Suez Canal crisis is just one example of how climate change could impact global supply chains. Extreme weather events such as hurricanes, typhoons, and storm surges could disrupt ports and transportation networks, leading to further delays and increased costs.\n\nFurther analysis suggests that broader weather patterns contributing to the event were unusually extreme, potentially linked to climate change effects on jet stream patterns. These patterns have the potential to create more frequent and intense weather events, further increasing the risks to supply chains.\n\nAs the world continues to grapple with the challenges posed by climate change, the Suez Canal crisis serves as a stark reminder of the vulnerability of our interconnected systems to extreme weather events and the importance of investing in resilient infrastructure and supply chains."}

This narrative, however, is false and lacks any credible corroboration.\n\nThe origins of this fabricated tale can be traced back to Before It's News, a website known for publishing false and misleading content. The initial report, published on April 4, 2021, contained numerous outlandish assertions.\n\nOne of the most egregious claims was that Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs) were found on the Ever Given, further implicating the shipping incident in a sinister international conspiracy. Yet, no credible news publisher or government entity has substantiated these accusations.\n\nThe Ever Given, a container ship operated by the Taiwanese Evergreen Marine Corporation, ran aground in the Suez Canal on March 23, 2021, causing a significant maritime traffic jam and disrupting global supply chains.\n\nAnother false claim in the narrative was that the Ever Given was co-owned by Walmart and the Clinton Foundation, implicating these entities in an international child trafficking ring. There is no evidence to support this allegation.\n\nThe narrative also suggested that trafficked children were ordered through catalogs like Wayfair by pedophiles. A similar baseless trafficking claim was made about the Wayfair online shopping website in July 2020, which was debunked by Snopes and other fact-checking organizations.\n\nThe false story gained traction on social media, with many users sharing a screenshot of a non-existent 'telegram' claiming the U.S. Navy SEALs had found live and dead children in cargo containers.\n\nIt is important to note that the Suez Canal rescue story is not the first time unsubstantiated claims of child trafficking have been associated with a high-profile news event. In the past, similar conspiracy theories have emerged around other incidents, such as the migration crisis in Europe and natural disasters.\n\nThese false narratives often rely on the power of social media to spread rapidly, fueled by emotions and a desire for sensational information. They exploit people's fears and prejudices, and seek to undermine trust in credible sources of news and information.\n\nFact-checking organizations like Snopes play a crucial role in debunking these false narratives, providing facts and evidence to counteract the misinformation. In this case, the lack of credible reporting on the Ever Given rescue story should serve as a red flag.\n\nIt is essential to remain skeptical of sensational claims that lack credible corroboration. In today's digital age, misinformation can spread quickly, making it more important than ever to fact-check and verify information before sharing it.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that U.S. Navy SEALs rescued over a thousand trafficked children from the Ever Given cargo ship is false. The story originated from a website known for publishing misinformation, and no credible news publisher or government entity confirmed the story.\n\nLet this serve as a reminder to always fact-check and verify information before sharing it, and to be wary of sensational claims that lack credible corroboration. By doing so, we can help combat the spread of misinformation and protect the integrity of accurate news reporting."}

The Ever Given ship incident is just the latest example.\"\n\nThe conspiracies began when some QAnon supporters linked the Taiwanese operator of the ship, Evergreen, to Clinton's secret service name, \"H3RC,\" and the ship's call sign \"H3RC,\" which they claimed were reminiscent of Clinton's initials.\n\nThese theories found a home on alternative social media platforms like Telegram and Gab, after being purged from mainstream social networks. However, PolitiFact debunked the theory, confirming there's no evidence linking the ship to Clinton or human trafficking.\n\nUndeterred by the lack of evidence, QAnon followers developed more intricate and baseless theories. Some claimed that the ship's captain was a deep cover agent, while others pointed to the pre-canal course of the ship, which resembled a crude drawing, as proof of a larger conspiracy.\n\nA spokesperson for vesselfinder.com, the source of the ship's tracking data, dismissed these conspiracy theories, stating, \"Our data is accurate, and there's no evidence to support the claims being made by QAnon followers.\"\n\nOne popular theory suggested that the ship's computers were hacked by those supportive of the QAnon cause, framing the incident as part of a larger plan. Funke commented, \"These types of conspiracy theories thrive on speculation and fear. They're not based on facts or evidence.\"\n\nQAnon theories also symbolically linked the Suez Canal to a birthing canal, indicating a forthcoming revelation against the deep state. Old QAnon posts mentioning to \"watch the water\" were reused as alleged proofs of the conspiracy's validity.\n\nAn elaborate \"proof\" board on a QAnon message board connected unconnected facts about the ship to QAnon prophecies, further fueling the conspiracy theories. Funke added, \"It's important to remember that these theories are not based on facts or evidence. They're driven by fear and speculation, and they can be harmful to individuals and communities.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the Ever Given ship incident is the latest example of how QAnon conspiracy theories continue to spread, even in the face of evidence to the contrary. These theories not only lack factual basis but can also be harmful to individuals and communities. As Funke put it, \"It's crucial that we continue to fact-check and debunk these conspiracy theories to prevent them from gaining traction and causing harm.\""}

He was 84.\n\n\"General Colin L. Powell, former U.S. Secretary of State and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, passed away this morning due to complications from Covid-19,\" Powell's family said in a statement. \"He was fully vaccinated. We want to thank the medical staff at Walter Reed National Medical Center for their caring treatment.\"\n\nDespite being fully vaccinated, Powell had underlying conditions, including Parkinson's disease and multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer.\n\nTributes poured in from various leaders, including former Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Powell's successor at the State Department, Condoleezza Rice.\n\n\"I was very saddened to hear of General Colin Powell's passing,\" Bush said in a statement. \"He was a great public servant, starting with his time as a soldier during Vietnam. He was such a favorite of Presidents and the American people. And his legacy will always be etched in American history.\"\n\n\"General Colin Powell was a patriot who served his country with honor and distinction over the course of his impressive military and diplomatic career,\" Obama said in a statement. \"Michelle and I were deeply saddened to learn of his passing. He was a dedicated servant of the American people, and Michelle and I send our thoughts to his family.\"\n\n\"Colin Powell was a friend, a mentor, and a role model,\" Rice said in a statement. \"I was deeply saddened to hear of his passing. He was an historic figure for generations to come.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden ordered flags to be lowered in Powell's honor and described him as embodying the highest ideals of both warrior and diplomat. \"General Colin Powell was a patriot who served his country with honor and distinction for over 50 years,\" Biden said in a statement. \"He was a military hero, a national security advisor, a secretary of State, a chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and a dedicated public servant.\"\n\nPowell endorsed Democrats Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton in their presidential campaigns, despite identifying as a Republican. He admitted that his support for the Iraq War, which began in 2003, haunted him and considered it a blot on his record.\n\n\"My biggest mistake? Probably giving the Iraq speech,\" Powell said in his 2012 memoir, \"It Worked For Me: In Life and Leadership.\" He was referring to his speech before the United Nations in 2003, in which he made the case for the U.S. invasion of Iraq based on claims that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.\n\nThe Bush administration's decision to invade Iraq, supported by Powell's UN speech, was later criticized as an intelligence failure. Powell was the son of Jamaican immigrants and made history as the first Black person to serve as national security advisor. His role in arguing for the U.S.'s invasion of Iraq was seen as a significant aspect of his legacy, despite his later regrets."}

Carville, known for his role in Bill Clinton's successful presidential campaigns, expressed his apprehension, stating, \"We're letting a noisy wing of our party define the rest of us\" (Cuomo, 2021).\n\nCarville, a seasoned political strategist, emphasized the importance of not allowing a vocal minority to dictate the party's direction. He argued, \"We've got to be careful not to give the opposition, which is going to be relentless and ruthless, a way to define us\" (Carville, 2021).\n\nThe debate around progressive policies, such as calls to \"defund the police,\" has become a contentious issue within the Democratic Party. According to Carville, these policies do not align with the majority of Americans' views. Polling data suggests that a significant portion of the population perceives the country as becoming too politically correct and opposes the \"defund the police\" movement (Pew Research Center, 2020).\n\nFormer President Donald Trump and the Republican Party have capitalized on this issue, using it to their advantage. Trump tweeted, \"The Radical Left Democrats have gone CRAZY!\" (Trump, 2021), suggesting that embracing far-left policies could alienate swing and Republican-leaning voters.\n\nCarville acknowledged the importance of not alienating the Democratic base but emphasized the need for the party to focus on policies that directly improve people's lives rather than on identity politics. He stated, \"We need to have a conversation about how we're going to get this country moving again\" (Carville, 2021).\n\nThis discussion reflects the broader debate within the Democratic Party on how to balance progressive and moderate elements. Some argue that progressive policies are necessary to address long-standing social and economic inequalities, while others contend that the party must cater to the concerns and values of the American electorate as a whole.\n\nCarville's criticism of the Democratic Party's focus on \"wokeness\" is not a new sentiment. In 2020, he wrote an op-ed for CNN, titled \"Joe Biden and the Democrats need to stop pandering to the radical left,\" where he voiced similar concerns (Carville, 2020).\n\nIn the interview with Chris Cuomo, Carville reiterated his stance, stating, \"We've got to do something that's going to move the country forward, not move it backward\" (Carville, 2021). This call for pragmatism within the Democratic Party is a reminder of the delicate balance between appealing to the base and appealing to the broader electorate.\n\nAs the political landscape continues to evolve, the debate on how the Democratic Party should navigate progressive and moderate elements will undoubtedly persist. Carville's warnings serve as a reminder of the importance of staying true to the party's core values while also being mindful of the concerns and values of the American electorate.\n\nReferences: - Carville, J.

PETERSBURG – Seven-time NASCAR champion Jimmie Johnson finds himself in awe of Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady, who at 43 years old led his team to a Super Bowl victory in February. Johnson, who turns 46 in September, sees Brady's success as a powerful message to athletes in their 40s.\n\n\"Tom Brady's career is inspiring,\" Johnson said during a press conference at the Firestone Grand Prix of St. Petersburg. \"Seven championships in two different sports is an incredible feat. It shows that age is just a number, and with hard work and dedication, you can continue to compete at a high level.\"\n\nJohnson, who won his NASCAR titles between 2006 and 2010, made the transition to IndyCar racing last year. Brady's recent team switch from the New England Patriots to the Buccaneers resonated with Johnson, who has embraced the challenge of learning a new racing series.\n\n\"Tom Brady's move to the Bucs showed me that it's never too late to try something new,\" Johnson said. \"IndyCar is a different animal than NASCAR, but I'm up for the challenge.

And for Johnson, it's an opportunity to continue his quest for championship glory.\n\n\"I'm excited to be a part of the Firestone Grand Prix of St. Petersburg,\" Johnson said. \"It's going to be a great event, and I'm looking forward to competing against some of the best drivers in the world.

Marjorie Taylor Greene from her committees, voted overwhelmingly to retain Rep. Liz Cheney as their No. 3 leader. In a closed-door session on Thursday, 145 House Republicans supported Cheney, rejecting a hard-right conservative push to oust her for her impeachment vote against former President Donald Trump.\n\nMinority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., criticized the Democratic push to remove Greene as a \"partisan power grab,\" stating, \"The Speaker's select committees are designed to be bipartisan, not weapons for political retribution.\" Cheney echoed McCarthy's sentiments, asserting, \"This is an attempt to silence a voice, and it's an attempt to bully and intimidate a member of Congress.\"\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., has come under fire for her past controversial social media activity, which includes supporting violence against Democrats and various conspiracy theories. Chair Jim McGovern, D-Mass., who heads the House Rules Committee, introduced a resolution to strip Greene of her committee assignments, citing \"threats of violence or intimidation, whether made publicly or privately, against Members, staff, or other individuals.\"\n\nMcCarthy initially remained largely silent on Greene's actions, but after a growing backlash, he publicly condemned her endorsement of conspiracy theories and violent views. In a statement, he asserted, \"Marjorie is wrong, and her implied support for violence is unacceptable. I've urged her to remove her harmful tweets and condemn that rhetoric.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., also weighed in on the issue, criticizing Greene and signaling a divide within the Republican Party. McConnell stated, \"Loony lies and wacky conspiracy theories are a cancer for the Republican Party and our country. Somebody who's suggested that perhaps no airplane hit the Pentagon on 9/11, or that wildfires in California were caused by a space laser controlled by Jewish people, or that the Clintons crashed JFK Jr.'s airplane is not living in reality.\"\n\nThe Republican Party now faces a pivotal moment of direction post-Trump presidency, torn between embracing Trump's divisiveness and returning to traditional conservative values. Cheney's impeachment vote and the controversy surrounding Greene's social media activity have put House Republicans under bipartisan pressure to address these issues and chart a course forward.\n\nThe internal GOP conflicts over these matters highlight Trump's continuing influence over the party. Cheney, a vocal Trump critic, and Greene, an ardent Trump supporter, represent opposing factions within the Republican ranks. The ongoing debates underscore the challenges facing the GOP as it seeks to redefine itself in the post-Trump era."}

Binge, Kenosha County Assistant District Attorney, filed an affidavit on January 11, 2022, requesting a modification of Rittenhouse's bond. Binge claimed he observed Rittenhouse at a bar in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin, on January 7, 2022, which allegedly violated bond conditions.\n\n\"I believe that the defendant's presence at a bar in Mount Pleasant on January 7, 2022, and his interaction with other individuals there, poses a risk of harm to the community,\" Binge stated in the affidavit.\n\nRittenhouse, who is charged with killing two people and injuring one during the Kenosha protests in August 2020, pleaded not guilty to the charges on January 5, 2022. The 18-year-old appeared in court via video conference during the brief hearing.\n\nBinge's motion also aims to restrict Rittenhouse from consuming alcohol, frequenting bars, and associating with white supremacist groups. In response, Mark Richards, one of Rittenhouse's defense attorneys, stated, \"We do not oppose the restriction from white supremacist groups but do take issue with restricting him from adult bars.\"\n\nRichards criticized the motion as an attempt to insert race into a self-defense case, stating, \"The state's attempt to link Mr. Rittenhouse to white supremacist groups, based on a brief interaction with a few people at a bar, is an offensive and baseless allegation.\"\n\nWisconsin law allows individuals aged 18-20 to drink alcohol under parental supervision. Rittenhouse's visit to the bar didn't violate bond conditions, as no evidence indicated he was consuming alcohol or behaving inappropriately.\n\nRittenhouse has also been accused of joining right-wing militias during the Kenosha protest. However, no evidence has been found that he followed such groups on social media or had any formal affiliation with them.\n\nRittenhouse's defense team has threatened legal action against those accusing him of white supremacy, stating in a January 11, 2022, press release, \"It appears that there is a coordinated effort among certain individuals and organizations to smear Mr. Rittenhouse's reputation with false accusations of white supremacy.\"\n\nDespite the ongoing controversy, Rittenhouse's trial is scheduled to begin on March 1, 2022.

The riot that ensued, which left five people dead including a Capitol Police officer and saw heavily armed Trump supporters storm the building, marked a pivotal moment in American history. For many, it was the day they realized the true danger posed by President Donald Trump to our democracy.\n\nAlaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski expressed her concerns, stating, \"We need to recognize that the president has let us down. He's let the country down. And has harmed his office and harmed our reputation as a leader of the free world.\" Republican Sen. Ben Sasse from Nebraska echoed her sentiments, stating, \"I've been a critic of the president's character and tactics for five years. And today, I believe history will mark today as a great inflection point in American history.\"\n\nThe President himself showed no remorse post-riot, maintaining a detached stance even as aides distanced themselves and social media banned him. Trump's tenure has been characterized by exploiting societal divisions, challenging democracy, and embracing controversial support. The riot and Trump's role in it have led to widespread condemnation, resignations, and calls for his resignation or impeachment.\n\nSen. John Thune, a member of the GOP leadership team, acknowledged the gravity of the situation, stating, \"There's no question that the president bears responsibility for Wednesday's violence.\" Even members of Trump's inner circle, such as Ivanka Trump, his daughter and senior adviser, and Mark Meadows, his White House Chief of Staff, issued statements condemning the violence.\n\nPat Cipollone, the White House Counsel, reportedly urged the President to condemn the riot unequivocally, but Trump's late attempt was seen as insufficient by many. The events of January 6 have strengthened calls for unity and a focus on a peaceful transition to President-elect Joe Biden.\n\nAs the nation grapples with the aftermath of the riot, it is clear that America has reached a turning point. The shocking scenes of the Capitol siege have served as a stark reminder of the fragility of our democracy and the importance of holding those in power accountable. In the words of Republican Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, \"This is a tragic day for the United States of America.\"\n\nIn the days and weeks that follow, the full implications of January 6, 2021, will continue to unfold.

The incident left many wondering about the cause behind this unprecedented disruption. One theory that circulated online suggested a military raid resulting in the seizure of Facebook servers. However, this claim was swiftly debunked by Facebook officials.\n\nStephon Rudd, a Facebook user from Atlanta, expressed his frustration, stating, \"I couldn't believe it when I saw that Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp were all down. I thought something major must have happened, like a cyber-attack or even a military raid.\"\n\nHowever, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg described the outage as the worst the company had seen in years, attributing it to human error during routine maintenance.\n\nSantosh Janardhan, Facebook's Vice President of Infrastructure, explained, \"During one of our routine maintenance activities, we triggered a cascading series of issues. An engineer issued a command that unintentionally disrupted Facebook's global data center connections.\"\n\nAn audit tool that was supposed to prevent such errors failed to stop the erroneous command, leading to the widespread outage.\n\nTom Parnell, a Communications Manager at Facebook, directly refuted the military raid claim, stating, \"There was no truth to the rumors of a military raid causing the Facebook outage. Santosh Janardhan, our Vice President of Infrastructure, has provided a detailed explanation of the actual cause.\"\n\nThe Department of Defense was reached for comment but had not responded at the time of publication. Despite the lack of an official statement from the DoD, the claim has been rated as false based on the facts provided by Facebook.\n\nThe outage removed Facebook from the Domain Name System servers, hindering internal investigation and resolution tools. Engineers had to manually restart systems at data centers, a process lengthened by security measures.\n\nJanardhan further explained, \"The outage also removed Facebook from the Domain Name System servers, which delayed the restoration process. Our engineers had to manually restart systems at our data centers, a process that was further complicated by security measures designed to protect our systems.\"\n\nJanardhan emphasized the importance of routine maintenance and the need for continuous improvement, stating, \"This incident underscores the importance of our ongoing efforts to improve our systems and processes. We are committed to learning from this experience and preventing similar disruptions in the future.\"\n\nAlthough the Facebook outage was not caused by a military raid, the incident highlighted the potential vulnerabilities and complexities of the modern digital infrastructure. The six-hour disruption served as a reminder that even the most ubiquitous platforms are not immune to human error and the need for constant vigilance and improvement.\n\nIn conclusion, the six-hour Facebook outage on Oct. 4, 2021, was not the result of a military raid, but rather a human error during routine maintenance. The incident underscored the importance of continuous improvement and the complexities of modern digital infrastructure."}

Andrew Cuomo. According to Nielsen Media Research, the show averaged 2.2 million viewers when Gov. Cuomo was a regular guest, a number that dropped to 1.6 million viewers after CNN barred coverage of him on the show.\n\nThe ban on Chris Cuomo covering his brother's scandals resulted in a 20% viewership loss compared to the same period in 2020. This decline is more pronounced in the key demographic of adults 25-to-54, with a 42% viewership loss. Gov. Cuomo is currently embroiled in multiple scandals, including allegations of sexual harassment and coverups of nursing home deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn February 2021, CNN communicated its decision to prevent Chris Cuomo from covering his brother's scandals, citing a longstanding policy with an exception made during the pandemic. Chris Cuomo addressed the situation on air, acknowledging that he couldn't cover his brother's scandals due to their relationship. However, public scrutiny increased as Chris Cuomo had previously covered his brother in more favorable times.\n\nThe decline in viewership for \"Cuomo Prime Time\" became more pronounced after Lindsey Boylan, a former aide to Gov.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) has introduced a bill to award Kyle Rittenhouse, the young man acquitted of killing two men during last year's unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, with the Congressional Gold Medal. Greene's bill, which was co-sponsored by Reps. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (R-Texas), claims Rittenhouse deserves the honor for \"protecting the community of Kenosha\" during a \"Black Lives Matter riot.\"\n\nHowever, the bill's chances of passing are slim. The House is currently controlled by Democrats, and the need for two-thirds co-sponsorship makes it an uphill battle. Many Democrats have criticized Rittenhouse, with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) calling his acquittal a \"miscarriage of justice.\"\n\nMatt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who has been rumored to be considering an internship for Rittenhouse, had a different take on the potential award.

He could face up to 40 years for second-degree murder, 25 years for third-degree murder, and 10 years for manslaughter. The maximum sentence for each charge would be applied concurrently, according to legal experts.\n\nThe charges stemmed from Chauvin's actions on May 25, 2020, when he knelt on Floyd's neck for over 9 minutes, leading to Floyd's death. During the 13-day trial, prosecutors presented evidence of Floyd's cause of death, witness testimonies, and Chauvin's lack of remorse.\n\nPresident Joe Biden weighed in on the verdict, expressing that it could be a step forward towards justice in America. \"Nothing can ever bring their brother, George Floyd, back,\" Biden said in a statement. \"But this can be a giant step forward in the march toward justice in America.\"\n\nMinnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison emphasized that the verdict signifies accountability, which is the first step toward justice. \"Throughout this trial, we have seen compelling and overwhelming evidence that then-Officer Derek Chauvin caused the death of George Floyd,\" Ellison said in a press release.\n\nPhilonise Floyd continued, \"We're all elated, we're very happy, but George isn't here. We're still in pain. It's not a win, it's not a victory. It's just a step towards justice.\"\n\nThe trial, broadcasted live due to COVID-19 restrictions, drew national attention to the legal proceedings. Protesters gathered outside the courthouse, cheering as the verdict was announced, and celebrations continued throughout the night.\n\nThe case has been highly influential, symbolizing racial injustice in the United States and prompting widespread protests. Floyd's death ignited demonstrations against police brutality and systemic racism in the United States and around the world.\n\nEllison thanked the jury for their \"thoughtful consideration of the evidence.\" He also extended gratitude to the Floyd family and the community for their \"unwavering commitment to justice for George.\"\n\nIn closing arguments, defense attorney Eric Nelson argued that Chauvin acted reasonably and that Floyd's death was due to a combination of factors, including drugs and underlying health conditions. Prosecutor Steve Schleicher countered that Chauvin's actions were the primary cause of Floyd's death.\n\nThe jury deliberated for nearly 16 hours before reaching their verdict. Chauvin's bail was revoked, and he was taken into custody. He will be sentenced at a later date.\n\nFloyd's death and the subsequent trial sparked conversations about police reform, the role of systemic racism in American society, and the need for police accountability. The verdict marks a significant moment in American history, providing a sense of justice for many, but also emphasizing the need for ongoing change.\n\nBiden concluded his statement by reiterating his commitment to addressing racial injustice: \"We can't turn back the clock, but we can move forward.

The suspension came after Twitter and Facebook indefinitely banned Trump's accounts for similar reasons.\n\nYouTube removed a video Trump uploaded earlier in the day for violating its policies. The video, believed to be from a news conference clip, was taken down due to content that allegedly violated YouTube's policies regarding violent or harmful content. Trump's account will remain active, but he cannot post new videos or live streams during the suspension.\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton issued legal demands to major tech companies, including Google, Twitter, and Facebook, for banning Trump and Parler, a social media platform favored by his supporters. Paxton's office said the moves may be in violation of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act.\n\nCriticism arose against YouTube for not acting more decisively against Trump's content prior to the suspension. Some critics argued that the company should have taken stronger action against Trump's account earlier, especially given the platform's history of allowing controversial content.\n\nUnlike Twitter and Facebook, which have permanent bans in place for Trump, YouTube operates a three-strike system for taking down channels. This means that a channel can be suspended for a certain period if it violates YouTube's policies three times. Trump's account had previously been issued two strikes for other violations.\n\nSocial media companies, including Google, Facebook, and Twitter, have faced scrutiny for not removing misinformation and inciteful content quickly enough. The Capitol attack, which was fueled in part by misinformation spread on social media, highlighted the need for more effective content moderation on these platforms.\n\nTech companies, including Google, Facebook, and Twitter, have paused political ads following the Capitol attack and ahead of President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration on January 20. The move was aimed at reducing the potential for misinformation and hate speech during a time of heightened tensions.\n\nThe suspension of Trump's YouTube account cuts him off from his major social media platforms, amid wider tensions between the tech industry and the White House. Trump's team has indicated that they will explore other options for reaching his supporters, but it remains to be seen how effective these alternatives will be."}

The 400-meter-long behemoth, operated by Taiwan's Evergreen Line, disrupted a significant portion of the world's maritime traffic, revealing the tenuous nature of international supply chains.\n\nAfter undergoing repairs in the Chinese port of Shanghai, the Ever Given is poised to resume sailing, but the far-reaching consequences of the incident continue to reverberate. Captain Hanse Kurisinkal, who led the retrieval crew that took over the vessel after it was dislodged, shared his perspective on the complex operation, stating, \"It was a race against time to prevent any further damage to the ship and the canal.\"\n\nThe Ever Given's predicament underscored the fragility of global supply chains, with industries such as agriculture, electronics, and pharmaceuticals feeling the brunt of the delays. As Cormac Mc Garry, Maritime Analyst at Control Risks, expressed his concerns, \"The concentrated volumes of cargo in these large vessels add risk to the global supply chain.\" An unnamed officer involved in the rescue effort added, \"We could see the impact on container rates and freight prices as companies scrambled to find alternative shipping solutions.\"\n\nWhile the Ever Given was being freed, its owner declared a contingency situation, requiring customers to pay fees to retrieve their goods. Many of these goods were perishable, with no choice but to be auctioned or discarded. The incident served as a stark reminder of the challenges faced by stranded crews and the potential financial repercussions for ship owners.\n\nThe Ever Given's voyage to China for repairs showcased the importance of regular maintenance and the high costs of damage for ship owners. Captain Kurisinkal elaborated, \"The Ever Given's incident highlights the need for regular inspections and maintenance to ensure the safe operation of these ULCVs.\" Mc Garry echoed this sentiment, stating, \"The cost of repairs for the Ever Given, estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars, is a stark reminder of the financial stakes involved in maritime transportation.\"\n\nThe incident raises concerns about the vulnerability of ULCVs to various risks, including intentional targeting in conflicts. Mc Garry warned, \"With the increasing size and importance of these vessels, the potential consequences of an attack on a ULCV could be catastrophic for global trade.\" An unnamed naval officer involved in the Ever Given's rescue shared his concerns, \"The size and maneuverability of these ships make them attractive targets for those seeking to disrupt international trade.\"\n\nNavigating such large vessels presents unique challenges, such as dealing with massive wind resistance due to the large number of containers. Kurisinkal emphasized, \"Navigating an ULCV through a canal like the Suez Canal requires precise planning, coordination, and execution.\" Mc Garry added, \"The increasing size of these vessels also means that incidents like the Ever Given's grounding could become more frequent.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the Ever Given's predicament in the Suez Canal served as a stark reminder of the fragility of global supply chains and the potential risks involved in the maritime transportation of goods. As the world's economies begin to recover from the pandemic, incidents like the Ever Given's grounding could have far-reaching consequences on international trade and the global economy. Kurisinkal summed it up, \"The Ever Given incident highlights the need for increased vigilance, collaboration, and innovation to ensure the safe and efficient operation of ULCVs and the global supply chain as a whole.\""}

Ten Republicans joined the Democratic majority in approving the article of impeachment, charging Trump with \"incitement of insurrection\" following last week's violent Capitol riots.\n\n197 Republicans still voted against impeaching Trump, reflecting the current high level of polarization in American politics. However, this number pales in comparison to previous impeachments.\n\nThe impeachment of President Andrew Johnson in 1868 and President Bill Clinton in 1998 displayed almost no cross-party support. The first impeachment of President Trump in 2019 also failed to gain significant Republican backing.\n\nTwo of the Republicans who voted for impeachment hail from Washington state, a state known for its top-two primary system. Representatives Jaime Herrera Beutler and Dan Newhouse, both moderates in their districts, acknowledged the gravity of the situation and chose to side with the majority.\n\nHowever, it is essential to note that Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) and Rep. Tom Rice (R-SC), among those who voted for impeachment, are not considered moderates by most objective observers. Cheney, the third-ranking Republican in the House, has faced backlash from her party for her stance.\n\nTrump's job approval rating among Republicans has recently dropped but remains above 70%. These numbers suggest that while some Republicans disagree with Trump's actions leading up to the Capitol riots, a majority still supports him.\n\nThis historic event parallels the impeachment proceedings against President Richard Nixon in 1974, which also saw considerable Republican support. However, Nixon ultimately resigned before the full impeachment process could be completed.\n\nNo Democrats voted against impeaching Trump, highlighting a record level of unity within the party. The House's action now moves to the Senate, where a trial is expected to begin in the coming weeks. The outcome remains uncertain, as the Senate is currently controlled by the Republicans.\n\nDemocrats, led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have called for Trump's removal from office, arguing that he is a danger to the country. Republicans, on the other hand, have criticized the impeachment process as politically motivated and unnecessary, given that Trump's term is coming to an end in January.\n\nAs the nation waits for the Senate's reaction to this historic vote, tensions remain high. The Capitol riots have left many Americans questioning the future of their democracy and the role of political leaders in shaping it.\n\nIn conclusion, the House's vote to impeach President Trump for a second time marks a significant moment in American political history. Despite the high level of polarization and the usual party-line nature of past impeachments, ten Republicans chose to side with the Democrats, making this the most bipartisan impeachment in history. The future of Trump's presidency and the direction of American politics hang in the balance as the Senate prepares for a trial."}

The jury consisted of 12 people: five men and seven women, representing a racial composition of six White, four Black, and two multiracial individuals.\n\nTwo alternate jurors, both White women, were dismissed before deliberations, which commenced on April 19. The jury selection process lasted from March 9 to March 23 at the Hennepin County Government Center.\n\nThe 45-year-old Chauvin faces up to 40 years for second-degree murder, 25 years for third-degree murder, and 10 years for second-degree manslaughter, according to Minnesota sentencing guidelines. Sentencing is scheduled for eight weeks from the trial, to be decided by Judge Peter Cahill.\n\nOn May 25, 2020, George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, died after Chauvin, a White former Minneapolis Police officer, kneeled on his neck for 9 minutes and 29 seconds during an arrest. The incident sparked nationwide protests against police brutality and racial injustice.\n\nChauvin's trial, which began on March 29, 2021, included testimony from 45 witnesses over approximately three weeks. The defense and prosecution used peremptory challenges to shape the jury based on views on policing and Black Lives Matter.

Alexander Kueng, and Tou Thao, are charged with aiding and abetting in the case and are expected to stand trial in August 2021. Their jury selection is ongoing.\n\nThe prosecution, led by Attorney General Keith Ellison, presented evidence that Floyd's death resulted from Chauvin's actions. Medical experts testified that Floyd died due to a lack of oxygen caused by Chauvin's knee on his neck, despite Floyd's pleas that he couldn't breathe.\n\nThe defense, led by attorney Eric Nelson, argued that Floyd's death was due to a combination of factors, including drug use and pre-existing health conditions, and that Chauvin's use of force was justified based on Floyd's resistance and the presence of a counterfeit $20 bill.\n\nThe jury deliberated for about 10 hours over two days before reaching a verdict. Their decision was met with relief and celebration from Floyd's family, the Black community, and civil rights organizations.\n\nMeanwhile, reactions from Chauvin's supporters and conservative groups have been more muted, with some expressing disbelief at the verdict and questioning the fairness of the trial. Protests, both in support of and in opposition to the verdict, have taken place across the United States.\n\nIn a statement, President Joe Biden called the verdict \"a step forward,\" but added that \"it's not enough.\" He urged continued efforts to address systemic racism and police brutality.\n\nThe trial's outcome is expected to have far-reaching consequences for police reform, racial justice, and public trust in law enforcement. It also serves as a reminder of the ongoing struggle for equality and the importance of holding individuals accountable for their actions."}

The situation remains extremely challenging, and we are working around the clock to help as many people as possible.\"\n\nUS President Joe Biden also addressed the ongoing situation in Afghanistan during a press conference on Thursday, stating: \"We're going to continue the evacuation mission as long as there's time.\"\n\nHeapeey added that the UK would continue to work closely with its international partners to ensure the safe evacuation of its citizens and Afghan allies.\n\nMeanwhile, the United Nations has called for an immediate ceasefire in Afghanistan to allow for the safe and orderly evacuation of foreign nationals and Afghans at risk."}

The project features posters, fliers, and digital banners displaying powerful images and messages that encourage adherence to health guidelines and address systemic racism.\n\nAccording to Edward Saywell, chair of the MFA's Prints and Drawings department, the campaign aligns with the museum's commitment to public art forms accessible from the street. \"Carrie Mae Weems is a visionary artist, and we are proud to support her in this important project,\" Saywell stated.\n\nOne of the posters on display at the MFA features a black-and-white photograph of a Black man, aiming to spark a conversation about racial inequity and the pandemic's toll on minority communities. Kristen Gresh, the MFA's senior photography curator, emphasized the poster's dual message on systemic violence and COVID-19's disproportionate effects. \"Carrie Mae Weems's powerful imagery encourages us to reflect on the intersectionality of these crises and the urgent need for change,\" Gresh said.\n\nThe \"RESIST\" posters, fliers, and digital banners are displayed across various public spaces in Boston and other major cities. Weems approached the MFA with the campaign in December, after starting work on it during the early lockdowns. The artist sought to create a collaborative and inclusive platform for dialogue around the pandemic's impact on underrepresented communities.\n\nThe campaign includes multiple messages, emphasizing systemic racism, violence, the importance of vaccination, and gratitude towards frontline workers. \"These posters are more than just visual art – they are a call to action and a reminder of our shared responsibility to protect one another,\" Gresh added.\n\nAnother poster in the series promotes vaccination as the best defense against the virus. Weems's poignant message reads: \"Vaccines save lives. Get vaccinated. Protect your community.\" The artist's collaboration with the MFA aims to bridge the gap between art and activism, using public spaces as a vehicle for dialogue and change.\n\nWeems's work has long addressed social and political issues, and the \"RESIST COVID/ TAKE 6\" project is no exception. The MFA's partnership with the artist serves as a testament to the power of public art in community connection and dialogue. \"Carrie Mae Weems's work challenges us to confront the complexities of our world and inspires us to work towards a more equitable future,\" Saywell concluded.\n\nThe \"RESIST COVID/ TAKE 6\" posters can be found at various locations throughout Boston, including the MFA, Fenway Park, and the Boston Public Library.

It's a serious matter, and we will take swift action against anyone who makes such threats.\"\n\nUnderwood's department detained four students, including two 9-year-olds, for making threats and creating concerning lists. \"The consequences of these actions can be life-altering,\" Underwood added.\n\nTwo middle school students in Waterford have been charged with making a false threat of terrorism, potentially facing up to 20 years in prison if convicted. Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy reported charging 18 youths in recent days for related crimes, stressing the importance of a community-wide effort to address the issue.\n\nWorthy's office has been working to educate parents and students on the risks since 2018, but recent events have highlighted the need for increased vigilance. \"We cannot stress enough that making threats, even in jest, is not acceptable,\" Worthy stated.\n\nThe Oakland County Sheriff's Office is investigating a note found in a high school, though it appears not to constitute a credible threat at this time. However, the incident serves as a reminder of the ongoing concern.\n\nWorthy warned that access to guns and their portrayal in popular culture could be contributing factors to the escalating problem. \"We need to confront these issues head-on, both at home and in our schools,\" she said.\n\nIn response to the wave of threats, many schools have increased their security measures, with some implementing metal detectors and increased police presence. Parents have been encouraged to discuss the severity of making threats with their children.\n\nUnderwood urged parents to monitor their children's social media activity and to report any concerning behavior to law enforcement. \"We all have a role to play in keeping our schools safe,\" he said.\n\nWorthy added, \"This is a complex issue that requires a multi-faceted approach. We need to work together to ensure the safety and well-being of our children.\"\n\nDetroit Public Schools Community District Superintendent Nikolai Vitti echoed Worthy's sentiments, stating, \"The safety and well-being of our students is our top priority. We will not tolerate any threats to that safety, and we will work closely with law enforcement to address any incidents.\"\n\nAs the investigation into the Oxford High School shooting continues and the number of threats against metro Detroit schools continues to rise, authorities remain committed to ensuring the safety of students and taking swift action against those who make threats.\n\nUnderwood emphasized, \"We will not allow fear to divide our community. We will work together to keep our schools safe and provide a learning environment where students can thrive.\"\n\nWorthy concluded, \"This is not a time for complacency. We must remain vigilant and work together to address the root causes of these threats and ensure the safety of our children.\"\n\nAs the situation continues to unfold, parents, students, and community members are urged to stay informed and report any concerning behavior to law enforcement. Together, we can work to prevent further incidents and ensure the safety and well-being of our children."}

By explicitly acknowledging the existence of white supremacy, Biden tied his remarks to the ongoing racial justice movement and the Black Lives Matter protests that have swept the nation.\n\nBiden's speech underscored the long history of racial struggle in the United States, emphasizing that \"this is a time of testing.\" He spoke of the \"sting of systemic racism\" and vowed to defeat domestic terrorism, political extremism, and white supremacy.\n\nPrevious presidents, including Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton, have spoken about racism but did not specifically address white supremacy. However, the term has evolved in recent years to describe not just overt hate groups but systemic racism that benefits white people at the expense of non-white people.\n\nInfluential individuals like Ta-Nehisi Coates and Colin Kaepernick have broadened the term's usage to encompass institutional racism. White supremacy is seen as operating through systems, like the disproportionate funding of majority-white schools and the higher likelihood of Black individuals being shot by police.\n\nDonald Trump, Biden's predecessor, denied systemic racism and opposed diversity training, claiming it portrayed America as a racist and sexist country. His administration even issued an executive order banning such training in federal agencies.\n\nBiden's acknowledgment of white supremacy indicates an understanding that ending racial inequality involves confronting institutional racism. By recognizing the systemic nature of the problem, he signaled a commitment to addressing the root causes of racial inequalities in US institutions.\n\nBiden's racially diverse cabinet appointments are seen as a step towards addressing racial inequalities. Kamala Harris, the first woman and person of color to hold the position of vice president, leads this effort. Other appointments, such as Deb Haaland as Secretary of the Interior and Lloyd Austin as Secretary of Defense, represent significant progress.\n\nHowever, Biden's acknowledgment of white supremacy and commitment to addressing racial inequality will face challenges. Opponents argue that such efforts will divide the nation and undermine American values. They claim that focusing on racial issues will only worsen tensions and distract from more pressing concerns.\n\nDespite these challenges, Biden's stance marks a significant shift in US discourse on race. By acknowledging the existence of white supremacy and the importance of addressing systemic racism, he has opened the door to a more honest and productive conversation about racial inequality in America. This conversation is crucial if the United States is to truly confront and overcome its longstanding racial divisions."}

The consequences of these changes are already being felt around the world, with severe droughts, intense rainfall events, and other water-related challenges.\"\n\nThese impacts are starting to have severe consequences. According to Gleick, \"Agriculture is one sector that is particularly vulnerable to these changes. Droughts can decimate crops, while heavy rainfall can lead to flooding and erosion. Moreover, clean water is essential for human health, and climate change threatens our ability to access it.\"\n\nGleick's research over the years has predicted many of these changes, and he expressed a sentiment of 'I told you so' regarding the predictions made by climate scientists. \"It's frustrating to see that so many of the risks we identified years ago are now becoming a reality,\" he said. \"But it's also a vindication of the work we've done.\"\n\nHowever, Gleick also expressed sadness in realizing that earlier policy actions could have mitigated some of the current impacts. \"We had the opportunity to take action years ago, but we didn't,\" he said. \"Now we're playing catch-up, and it's going to be much more difficult and expensive.\"\n\nGleick emphasized the importance of recognizing the longstanding and increasing global temperatures. \"The data is clear: temperatures are rising, and they're not coming down anytime soon,\" he said. \"We need to adjust our policies and practices accordingly.\"\n\nIt's important to note that access to climate change data is region-restricted in some areas, making it difficult for scientists and policymakers to fully understand the scope and severity of these impacts. \"We need to ensure that data is accessible to everyone, regardless of where they live or work,\" Gleick stressed. \"Only then can we effectively address the challenges posed by climate change.\"\n\nDespite these challenges, Gleick remains optimistic. \"We have the knowledge and technology to adapt to these changes and mitigate their impacts,\" he said. \"But we need to act quickly and decisively.

However, she has expressed bitterness and regret over the events following the January 6 insurrection and her departure from Washington.\n\n\"She's disappointed by how things ended and is upset about her tarnished image,\" a source close to Melania Trump told CNN. The former first lady had the lowest favorability ratings of any modern first lady upon leaving office, with a Gallup poll showing her approval rating at just 40%.\n\nMelania Trump faced criticism for not making a public statement condemning the January 6 Capitol riot, fearing backlash from either side. \"She didn't want to be pulled into the political fray,\" Winston Wolkoff said. \"She didn't want to be seen as taking sides.\"\n\nDespite feeling overlooked by the media, Melania Trump turned down multiple offers for interviews and magazine features during her time as first lady.

While these shortages echo some of the early challenges faced during the COVID-19 pandemic, they are distinct in their cause.\n\nDavid Anderson, an economist with the Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service, emphasizes that this shortage is not a result of a systemic supply issue but rather the complex interplay of supply and demand affected by weather conditions. \"It's important to understand that the current grocery shortages in Texas are primarily driven by weather-related disruptions to the supply chain, not a persistent problem with food production or distribution,\" Anderson explained.\n\nHowever, the situation has been made worse by complications in the electric grid and water supply. Many processing plants and transportation networks have been shut down due to power outages and lack of water, further disrupting the supply chain.\n\nSnow, ice storms, and other weather events can cause both immediate and long-term food production problems. Frozen crops, damaged livestock, and disrupted irrigation systems are just some of the potential consequences. AgriLife Extension agents and other officials are currently assessing the damages and economic impacts of the storm.\n\nIn the short term, the most significant impacts are expected on beef and poultry production. Several major processing plants were forced to shut down due to power outages and loss of livestock, leading to temporary price increases.\n\n\"This is primarily a transportation and supply chain issue, which should be short-lived,\" Anderson said. \"Once the power is restored, and the roads are cleared, the situation should improve relatively quickly.\"\n\nDuring the storm, consumers stockpiled goods, exacerbating the shortage as resupply efforts were hindered. This behavior is not unusual during crises, but it can worsen the situation for those most in need.\n\n\"A demand-side issue also contributes to the shortages,\" Anderson noted. \"It's crucial for consumers to remain flexible and patient during these situations.\"\n\nFlexibility, planning, and patience are essential for consumers to better navigate such situations in the future. Anderson recommends keeping a well-stocked emergency food supply, being open to alternative food sources, and being prepared for potential price increases.\n\n\"The current crisis underscores the importance of resilient food systems that can withstand extreme weather events and other disruptions,\" Anderson said. \"It's a reminder that we all have a role to play in ensuring that our communities are prepared for the unexpected.\"\n\nQuote from David Anderson: \"It's important to understand that the current grocery shortages in Texas are primarily driven by weather-related disruptions to the supply chain, not a persistent problem with food production or distribution.\"\n\n\"This is primarily a transportation and supply chain issue, which should be short-lived.

The interview, initially intended to discuss Twitter suspensions and \"cancel culture,\" quickly devolved when Lindell reiterated his false election fraud allegations.\n\nSellers made it clear that Newsmax did not share Lindell's views on the election outcome. \"Mike, we've acknowledged your right to your opinion, but we have not been able to verify these allegations,\" Sellers said, reading aloud Newsmax's position on the matter.\n\nDominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic, two major voting technology companies, have raised the possibility of legal action against Newsmax for false reporting, as reported by The New York Times. This prompted the network to air a segment refuting election fraud claims, emphasizing that they accept the election results as legal and final.\n\nIn an interview with The Washington Post, Sidney Powell, a former Trump lawyer, acknowledged that Dominion had filed a $1.3 billion defamation suit against her for making baseless claims about the company. Powell's statements regarding Dominion and the election have been widely discredited by fact-checkers and election experts.\n\nBrian Peterson, Newsmax spokesman, released a statement after the interview, emphasizing the network's different viewpoint from Lindell's but acknowledging his right to an opinion.

However, Lindell persisted in making false statements, leading Sellers to walk off set in frustration.\n\nTwitter also permanently suspended President Trump's account earlier in January following the Capitol riot for repeated violations of the platform's policies. Trump's account was suspended after he posted messages that were perceived as inciting violence.\n\nNewsmax anchor Heather Childers, who was also present during the interview, tried to redirect the conversation towards the topic of Twitter suspensions and free speech.

As the first Black Secretary of State, Powell was a trailblazer and a testament to the possibilities of American meritocracy. However, former President Donald Trump saw fit to tarnish Powell's memory with a tasteless and disrespectful statement, revealing yet again his lack of decency.\n\nTrump's statement regarding Powell's death read like a petty attack. He referred to Powell as a \"RINO,\" or a Republican In Name Only, a term often used to belittle those who do not fully adhere to the conservative ideology. Trump also took the opportunity to highlight Powell's mistakes, such as his role in the Iraq War, which Powell himself later regretted.\n\nThe contrast between Trump's statements and the tributes paid to Powell by world leaders and his colleagues could not be more stark. Powell was remembered as an intellectual, patriot, and human being, far superior to Trump in every way. While Trump attacked a man who had dedicated his life to serving the nation, world leaders praised Powell's leadership and his contributions to American diplomacy.\n\nTrump's criticism of Powell was not an isolated incident. Throughout his political career, Trump has attacked Republican leaders, even belittling war heroes like John McCain. Trump's behavior is not becoming of a leader, but rather that of a bully and a grifter, who misled his supporters with false promises and empty rhetoric.\n\nPowell, on the other hand, was a man of substance. He served his country with grace and distinction, both as a military leader and a diplomat. Powell's regret over his role in the Iraq War was a testament to his integrity and his willingness to take responsibility for his mistakes. Trump, on the other hand, refuses to take responsibility for any failures, including his administration's disastrous COVID-19 response.\n\nTrump's continued falsehoods about a \"rigged\" election and his relentless attacks on the media further highlight his lack of decency. While Powell was a man of principle, Trump is a man of chaos, who thrives on division and confusion. Trump's words and actions are a stain on the American political landscape, and his response to Powell's death is just the latest example.\n\nColin Powell may no longer be with us, but his legacy will endure. He was a man of integrity, a man of honor, and a man of principle. Trump, on the other hand, is a man of deceit, a man of dishonesty, and a man of petty attacks. As we remember Powell and his contributions to our nation, let us also remember the importance of decency, integrity, and honor in our leaders. Trump's response to Powell's death is a sad reflection of his lack of these qualities, and a reminder of why he is unfit to lead."}

In an interview with Fox News' Tucker Carlson set to air on Thursday, Rittenhouse discussed his perspective on the case, which has become a focal point for debates on Second Amendment rights, self-defense, and protests against police brutality.\n\nRittenhouse, who is white, stated, \"I believe that the BLM movement wants to bring attention to police brutality and racism. I can't condemn them for wanting equality and wanting justice. But it's being hijacked to create a narrative that's not truthful.\"\n\nDavid Hancock, a spokesman for the Rittenhouse family, described Kyle as caring, empathetic, and civic-minded. \"Kyle is a young man who stepped up to defend his community during a time of unrest,\" Hancock said in a statement. \"He is not a racist or a white supremacist, as some have wrongly labeled him.\"\n\nRittenhouse traveled to Kenosha in August 2020 when the city was rocked by protests following the shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, by a white police officer. In the interview with Carlson, Rittenhouse maintained that the case was about self-defense, not race.\n\nAt trial, Rittenhouse argued he fired in self-defense after being attacked. Prosecutors claimed he provoked the confrontations that led to the shootings. A jury recently found him not guilty on all charges related to the shootings.\n\nRittenhouse has been photographed with members of the Proud Boys, a far-right organization. However, his attorneys deny that he is a white supremacist.\n\nDerrick Johnson, president and CEO of the NAACP, views the trial result as a \"warning shot\" for Black communities about \"vigilante justice.\" In a statement, Johnson said, \"The acquittal of Kyle Rittenhouse sends a dangerous message that it's open season on people protesting for their civil rights.\"\n\nRittenhouse's acquittal has sparked heated reactions from both sides of the aisle, with some celebrating the verdict as a victory for Second Amendment rights and self-defense, while others expressing concerns about the potential for violence during protests and the role of armed civilians in law enforcement.\n\nIn his interview with Carlson, Rittenhouse expressed remorse for the loss of life during the protests but maintained that he acted in self-defense. \"I wish I could have done something differently that night,\" he said. \"But I can't change the past. I can only learn from it and move forward.\"\n\nAs the country continues to grapple with issues of race, police brutality, and the role of armed civilians in law enforcement, the Rittenhouse case is likely to remain a point of contention and debate for the foreseeable future."}

Some commentators have suggested that Rittenhouse's acquittal was solely due to his race, implying a person of color in his position would not have been so fortunate. However, this argument overlooks the legal principle of self-defense, which has been successfully employed by defendants of all races.\n\nSelf-defense is a fundamental right enshrined in the United States Constitution. It allows individuals to use force against another person when they reasonably believe they are in imminent danger of bodily harm. The fact that self-defense claims have been upheld for defendants of color demonstrates that juries can and do recognize these claims, regardless of the race of the defendant.\n\nOne such example is Tony Bristol, an African American man who was acquitted of second-degree murder in Florida in 2005. In a case eerily similar to Rittenhouse's, Bristol shot and killed a man who had attacked him with a metal pipe. The jury found that the use of deadly force was justified based on the threat posed to Bristol.\n\nAnother case involves Stephen Spencer, a Native American man from South Dakota, who was acquitted of manslaughter in 2005. Spencer shot and killed a man who had assaulted him and his wife during a confrontation. The jury concluded that Spencer had acted in self-defense and defense of his wife.\n\nMore recently, in 2012, Jaron Moore, an African American man, was acquitted of second-degree murder in Maryland. Moore had shot and killed a man who had entered his home uninvited and threatened him with a knife. The jury found that Moore had acted in self-defense based on the evidence presented at trial.\n\nThese cases, among others, disprove the notion that only white Americans can successfully claim self-defense. Rittenhouse's acquittal, therefore, does not set a racial double standard for self-defense claims. Instead, it reflects the application of the law to the facts of the case, regardless of the defendant's race.\n\nIt is essential to remember that Rittenhouse faced significant legal and personal challenges before his acquittal. He was charged with multiple counts of homicide and faced potential life imprisonment. The narrative that he effortlessly 'got away with murder' is a simplistic and inaccurate portrayal of the situation.\n\nComparatively, there are numerous cases of white defendants whose self-defense claims were unsuccessful. For instance, Anthony James Trifiletti, a white man, was convicted of second-degree murder in New York in 2012. Trifiletti had shot and killed an intruder in his home, but the jury did not find that he had acted in self-defense based on the evidence presented. This case illustrates that self-defense claims are not always successful, regardless of the defendant's race.\n\nIn conclusion, the acquittal of Kyle Rittenhouse on charges related to the shooting during the Kenosha unrest does not establish a racial double standard for self-defense claims. Self-defense is a legal principle that has been successfully employed by defendants of all races, as evidenced by cases such as Tony Bristol, Stephen Spencer, and Jaron Moore. The application of self-defense law to the facts of each case, regardless of the defendant's race, ensures a fair and just legal system."}

This statement reflects the current understanding as of 7 December 2021, particularly in the context of the Omicron variant.\n\nBooster doses aim to restore vaccine effectiveness after it has diminished over time, ensuring long-term protection against COVID-19. However, WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called for a moratorium on booster doses for healthy adults until the end of 2021 to improve global vaccine equity.\n\nVaccine booster decisions should consider individual and public health benefits, as well as global vaccine access equity. The primary global health goal is to reduce COVID-19 deaths and severe disease, protect health systems, and ensure equitable access to vaccines.\n\nEmerging data show a decline in vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 over time, more so in older adults. Vaccine effectiveness against severe COVID-19 decreased by about 8% over a period of 6 months in all age groups.\n\nGiven these findings, WHO recommends an additional dose for certain inactivated vaccines for those aged 60 and over as part of the primary series. Booster vaccinations show strong immunological response, with studies indicating improved protection against infection and severe disease.\n\nHowever, prioritizing booster doses for high-income countries while low- and middle-income countries struggle to vaccinate their populations exacerbates health inequities and risks prolonging the pandemic. WHO emphasizes the need for a coordinated, equitable global response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDr. Mariangela Simao, Assistant-Director General for Access to Health Products, emphasizes, \"We are at a critical juncture in the pandemic response. Vaccines save lives and protect against severe disease. However, it is essential that we use them equitably to protect not only individuals but also communities and health systems.\"\n\nSAGE is currently assessing the evidence on booster doses for various COVID-19 vaccines and will provide recommendations based on the latest data. In the interim, WHO encourages countries to focus on fully vaccinating their populations with the primary series and addressing vaccine hesitancy.\n\nThe COVID-19 vaccine rollout has been uneven, with high-income countries administering the majority of doses. As of 6 December 2021, over 6 billion doses have been administered globally, but only 5% of people in low-income countries have received a single dose.\n\nWHO and partners, including the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, are working to increase vaccine supply, improve distribution, and address hesitancy. The Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator aims to ensure equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines.\n\nIn conclusion, the WHO, supported by SAGE, continues to review the evidence on booster doses for COVID-19 vaccines, considering both individual and public health benefits and global vaccine access equity. Prioritizing a coordinated, equitable global response to the pandemic is essential to protect populations, reduce deaths and severe disease, and ultimately end the COVID-19 pandemic."}

The color, symbolizing unity, was a standout choice for many attendees, from politicians to everyday citizens, during the inaugural events.\n\nAmong the most prominent figures donning the hue were Vice President Kamala Harris, incoming First Lady Jill Biden, and former First Lady Hillary Clinton. \"I wore purple because it's the color of unity,\" Hillary Clinton shared in a statement to CNN.\n\nDesigner Jonathan Cohen, who created Kamala Harris's inauguration day outfit, confirmed the significance of the color in an interview with Vogue. \"Purple is a color that symbolizes the coming together of red and blue,\" he explained. \"It's a color that represents unity, and that's what this moment is about.\"\n\nActress Jane Lynch, a vocal supporter of the Biden administration, also wore a purple ensemble to the inaugural parade. \"I wanted to wear a color that represents unity and hope,\" she shared with People magazine. \"Purple is the perfect color for that.\"\n\nAuthors and commentators have noted the significance of the gesture, with Kate Andersen Brower, author of \"First Women: The Grace and Power of America's Modern First Ladies,\" observing that \"the choice of purple and the theme of unity are intentional responses to the political and social divides in our country.\"\n\nHillary Clinton's decision to wear purple was a deliberate one, she shared, reflecting on the long-standing political divide between the red and blue parties. \"It's important that we come together as a nation, and I believe that purple is a powerful symbol of that unity,\" she stated.\n\nThe color purple has long been associated with unity, but it also holds symbolic meaning for women's suffrage. Michelle Obama, Laura Bush, and Hillary Clinton all wore shades of the hue on Inauguration Day, a fact not lost on social media users.\n\nKamala Harris, the first woman and the first person of South Asian and African American descent to be elected Vice President, previously wore white to the 2017 Women's March to symbolize women's suffrage. But on Inauguration Day, she opted for purple, possibly as a nod to Shirley Chisholm, the first Black woman elected to Congress.\n\nThe emphasis on unity was all the more poignant amid the backdrop of President Donald Trump and Melania Trump breaking traditional inauguration protocols. Melania Trump's decision not to invite Jill Biden for the traditional first lady tour was a significant departure from past practices.\n\n\"This is a moment for unity, and it's important that we come together as a country,\" Harris said in her inaugural address. \"We may have political differences, but we are all Americans, and we all want the same things for our families and our communities.\"\n\nKamala Harris's choice of purple was a deliberate one, her team confirmed, designed to underscore the need for unity in a time of political and social turmoil. \"The Vice President wanted to wear a color that reflected the theme of unity and hope,\" a spokesperson shared with CNN.\n\nAs the day wore on, the sight of so many people wearing purple became a powerful visual reminder of the importance of unity in a deeply divided nation. From the steps of the Capitol to the streets of Washington, D.C., and beyond, the color purple became a symbol of hope and unity for millions.\n\nJill Biden, too, echoed the theme of unity in her fashion choices, wearing a purple coat and scarf for the inaugural parade. \"Unity is what we need right now,\" she told reporters. \"And that's what we're going to focus on as First Lady.\"\n\nThe symbolism of the color purple extended beyond the fashion choices of political figures. Across the country, people wore purple in solidarity with the theme of unity. From virtual events to in-person gatherings, the color purple became a rallying cry for those seeking to bridge political and social divides.\n\nThe emphasis on unity was not lost on the international community either. World leaders, including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and French President Emmanuel Macron, donned shades of purple to show their support for the new administration and its message of unity.\n\nAs the inaugural festivities came to a close, the significance of the color purple and the theme of unity it represented lingered in the air. It was a reminder that, despite political and social differences, we are all Americans, and we all want the same things for our families and our communities. And, as Hillary Clinton put it, \"it's important that we come together as a nation and focus on the things that unite us, rather than the things that divide us.\""}

(AP) – Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald announced involuntary manslaughter charges against James and Jennifer Crumbley, the parents of the teenager accused of shooting and killing four students at Oxford High School. The prosecutor claimed the parents failed to intervene despite warnings, including a chilling drawing found at their son's desk.\n\nEthan Crumbley, 15, has been charged as an adult with murder and terrorism for the November 30, 2021, shooting that left four students dead and seven others injured.\n\nAccording to authorities, the parents bought the gun for Ethan and failed to secure it, resisting efforts to remove him from school on the day of the shooting. In a press conference on December 3, 2021, McDonald stated, \"The parents were contacted multiple times throughout the day about Ethan's behavior. They came in and they refused to take him home from school.\"\n\nMike Bouchard, Oakland County Sheriff, added, \"The parents were given an opportunity to take their son home before this tragic event occurred, and they chose not to.\"\n\nThe U.S. Marshals Service offered a reward of up to $10,000 for information leading to the Crumbleys' arrest. However, Shannon Smith, the Crumbleys' attorney, stated in a statement, \"Mr. and Mrs. Crumbley are not hiding, they are cooperating with law enforcement. They are not flight risks. They are absolutely shocked by the allegations being levied against them.\"\n\nSchool officials had previously been alarmed by Ethan's behavior, including searching for ammunition on his phone. McDonald said an investigation revealed that Ethan had conducted an internet search for ammunition on his school-issued device just hours before the shooting.\n\nA note with violent drawings and messages was found on Ethan's desk the day before the shooting, prompting school officials to contact his parents and recommend counseling.\n\nOn the day of the shooting, Jennifer Crumbley texted Ethan, \"Ethan, don't do it,\" as the shooting was unfolding. Later that day, James Crumbley reported a gun missing from their home.\n\nThe firearm used in the shooting was purchased by Ethan's father and openly posted about on social media. In a now-deleted post, James Crumbley held the gun and wrote, \"Getting my boy a new shotgun for Christmas.\"\n\nMcDonald did not rule out charges against school officials, stating, \"The investigation is ongoing. We will follow the facts and the evidence where they lead.\"\n\nThe families of the victims and the community are grappling with the tragedy and demanding accountability from those who may have played a role in the shooting.

Special\n\nJoe Biden's inauguration on January 20, 2021, was a historic event watched by millions around the world. Several people witnessed the ceremony in person, and it was broadcast live by numerous reputable news outlets, including ABC, CNN, C-SPAN, Fox News, NBC, and PBS. However, despite the evidence, claims that the inauguration was fake or that Biden is not the real president continue to circulate online.\n\nThese baseless allegations are a part of a larger conspiracy theory that suggests Biden's inauguration was staged due to a lack of disruptive events and perceived discrepancies. Social media posts spreading this theory have been flagged by Facebook as part of their efforts to combat false news.\n\nThe White House's official inauguration video, which has more dislikes than likes on YouTube, remains available. The presence of dislikes does not equate to evidence of a staged inauguration.\n\nOne of the most persistent rumors surrounding Biden's presidency is that his executive orders are not available online. However, this claim is false. All of Biden's executive orders have been published on the Office of the Federal Register website.\n\nAnother false claim is that Biden's granddaughters, Finnegan and Natalie, disappeared and reappeared during inauguration coverage. In reality, they were present throughout the ceremony but were captured on camera from different angles.\n\nBiden took a private plane to Washington D.C. for his inauguration due to security concerns. Breaking with tradition, he did not use the government plane provided by the outgoing administration.\n\nClaims that Biden's Oval Office appearances were filmed on a movie set are also debunked. Biden has been seen multiple times in the White House since his inauguration.\n\nThe theory that Biden's presidency is illegitimate is not new. Similar claims were made during the 2020 election cycle, and they persist despite a lack of evidence.\n\nSocial media platforms, including Facebook, have taken steps to combat the spread of false information about the election and inauguration. However, these efforts are not foolproof, and misinformation continues to spread.\n\nThe conspiracy theory that the inauguration was staged is not unique to Biden. Similar claims have been made about past presidents, including Barack Obama and Donald Trump.\n\nOne common thread in these conspiracy theories is the belief that the mainstream media is involved in a cover-up. However, there is no evidence to support this claim.\n\nAnother recurring theme is the belief that the government is hiding something. Again, there is no evidence to support this claim.\n\nThe origins of the theory that the inauguration was staged are unclear. Some versions of the theory claim that Biden was sworn in secretly on January 20, while others claim that the ceremony was pre-recorded and broadcast later.\n\nThere is no evidence to support either of these claims. Biden was sworn in publicly on January 20, and the ceremony was broadcast live.\n\nThe theory that the inauguration was staged also relies on perceived discrepancies in the coverage. However, these discrepancies can often be explained by different camera angles or editing choices.\n\nSome versions of the theory claim that Biden was wearing a wire during the inauguration. However, there is no evidence to support this claim.\n\nOther versions of the theory claim that Biden was wearing a mask to hide something. However, masks were required at the inauguration due to COVID-19 protocols.\n\nThe theory that the inauguration was staged also relies on the belief that there were no protesters or disruptive events. However, there were numerous security measures in place to prevent protests and ensure a peaceful transition of power.\n\nThe theory that the inauguration was staged also relies on the belief that there were discrepancies in the crowd size. However, it is important to note that crowd size estimates can vary widely depending on the source.\n\nThe theory that the inauguration was staged also relies on the belief that Biden's executive orders were not real. However, as previously mentioned, all of Biden's executive orders have been published on the Office of the Federal Register website.\n\nThe theory that the inauguration was staged also relies on the belief that Biden's Oval Office appearances were filmed on a movie set. However, as previously mentioned, Biden has been seen multiple times in the White House since his inauguration.\n\nThe theory that Biden's presidency is illegitimate is a dangerous one. It undermines the democratic process and can lead to violence and civil unrest.\n\nIt is important to fact-check claims about the inauguration and Biden's presidency. Misinformation can be harmful, and it is important to get the facts straight.\n\nIf you come across claims about the inauguration or Biden's presidency that seem suspicious, take the time to fact-check them. Check the sources of the information and look for evidence to support the claims."}

The comedic segment, which has since gone viral, portrays Cuomo as an \"epic news bro,\" a moniker that plays on his on-air catchphrase, \"let's get after it.\"\n\nThe clip begins by highlighting Cuomo's Yale education and his decision to pursue a career in journalism instead of following in the footsteps of his father, former New York Governor Mario Cuomo, and his brother, former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, both of whom had prominent political careers. The segment then mocks Cuomo's entry into TV journalism, insinuating that he leveraged his family name to secure a position.\n\nAs the clip progresses, it touches on Cuomo's on-air persona and his battle with COVID-19 earlier this year.

However, it is the anchor's handling of his brother's sexual harassment scandal that draws the most scrutiny.\n\nAndrew Cuomo resigned as New York Governor in August 2021 following allegations of sexual harassment from multiple women. Chris Cuomo, who was employed by CNN at the time, faced calls to recuse himself from covering the story due to his familial relationship. However, he continued to report on the scandal and, according to reports, even offered advice to his brother on how to handle the situation.\n\nThe Daily Show clip critically addresses Chris Cuomo's role in his brother's scandal. It mocks his advice to Andrew Cuomo, which reportedly included owning his actions and being contrite. Despite the mounting pressure, Chris Cuomo chose to remain in his position at CNN, leading to further controversy.\n\nThe YouTube clip does not shy away from poking fun at Chris Cuomo's decision to stay on the air. It jokingly suggests that his tenure at CNN is a result of his family name and political connections, rather than his journalistic abilities. The segment also playfully speculates about what other scandals the Cuomo family might be involved in.\n\nThe Daily Show's satirical take on Chris Cuomo's career and familial ties is not the first time the anchor has faced criticism for his role in his brother's scandal. In October 2021, New York Attorney General Letitia James released a report detailing the findings of an investigation into the sexual harassment allegations against Andrew Cuomo. The report concluded that he had engaged in inappropriate behavior towards multiple women, leading to renewed calls for Chris Cuomo to resign from CNN.\n\nHowever, Chris Cuomo has maintained that he did not violate any journalistic ethics by reporting on his brother's scandal. In a statement, he said, \"As I have always said, I put my family first, and in these personal situations that choice has also meant keeping my job and doing it in a way I can be proud of.\"\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding Chris Cuomo's involvement in his brother's scandal and the satirical take on his career by The Daily Show, he remains a prominent figure in TV journalism. Only time will tell how this situation continues to unfold and whether Chris Cuomo's tenure at CNN will be affected in the long term."}

However, experts warn that the repercussions of this incident will be felt for weeks, if not months, to come.\n\n\"The Suez Canal blockage has resulted in significant backlogs not only in the Suez Canal itself but also in the ports on both ends of the canal,\" Douglas Kent, Executive Vice President of Strategy and Alliances at the Association for Supply Chain Management, told CNBC. \"The knock-on effects are going to be felt for a while.\"\n\nWith around 12% of global trade, or over $9 billion daily, passing through the Suez Canal, the implications of this disruption are far-reaching. Stephen Flynn, Professor of Political Science at Northeastern University and Founding Director of the Global Resilience Institute, predicts that it will take at least 60 days for supply chains to normalize.\n\n\"The Ever Given incident exposed the fragility of our global supply chains,\" Flynn stated. \"Large ships like the Ever Given challenge port capacities and create concentrated systems. When these systems are disrupted, it can take a long time to recover.\"\n\nMark Szakonyi, Executive Editor of The Journal of Commerce by IHS Markit, shared similar sentiments, cautioning that months of supply chain disruptions are ahead. \"We're seeing a ripple effect throughout the entire global supply chain,\" he told CNBC.\n\nSome companies have had to reroute their ships around the Cape of Good Hope, incurring additional costs. According to Szakonyi, this will likely continue for several weeks, adding to the overall disruption.\n\nBy Monday, over 350 vessels were waiting to transit the Suez Canal, with traffic resumption expected in three to four days. However, even when the canal is fully operational again, the backlogs in ports and delivery mechanisms will still need to be addressed.\n\n\"The Suez Canal blockage was just the tip of the iceberg,\" Kent emphasized. \"We're dealing with a much larger issue here, and it's going to take some time to resolve.\"\n\nFlynn agreed, emphasizing the need for greater resilience in global supply chains. \"This incident serves as a reminder that we need to build more redundancy and resilience into our global supply chains,\" he said. \"We can't afford to have such significant disruptions in the future.\"\n\nAs the world waits for the supply chain disruptions to subside, it's clear that the Ever Given's release from the Suez Canal is just the beginning of a long and complex recovery process."}

Cheney emphasized, \"We have always prioritized the safety and well-being of our cast and crew, and we will continue to do so.\"\n\nThe IATSE (International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees) union had criticized the production for hiring a non-union crew following a walkout, citing concerns over working conditions and safety protocols. In response to Cheney's statement, IATSE issued a statement of their own, expressing their condolences to the victims and their families, while reiterating their call for a thorough investigation into the incident and the working conditions on the set.\n\nCheney's statement also addressed the union criticism, asserting that \"Rust\" is union-certified and in good standing with major production unions including IATSE, the Teamsters, SAG (Screen Actors Guild), and DGA (Directors Guild of America).\n\nThe tragic shooting incident on the \"Rust\" set on October 21, 2021, has sent shockwaves through the film industry and beyond.

The recent discovery of Gabby Petito's body in Grand Teton National Park has brought renewed attention to Daniel's case, as both missing persons share eerily similar circumstances - young adults who vanished without a trace in remote locations.\n\nSpeaking to Newsweek, David Robinson II, Daniel's father, expressed his concern and frustration, \"It's heartbreaking to know that people are still disappearing, and it seems like no progress is being made in our son's case. We just want answers.\"\n\nRobinson went missing on June 23, after leaving a job site near Sun Valley Parkway and Cactus Road. He was last seen driving a 2017 blue Jeep Renegade. Daniel, described as a 5-foot-8 man with black hair and brown eyes, was reported missing with his right forearm and hand missing.\n\nOn July 19, Robinson's damaged vehicle was found near a ravine, with personal items inside, but no sign of Daniel. A human skull was discovered on July 31, but it was not identified as Daniel's. Foul play is not suspected by investigators.\n\n\"I've been working on this case for over a month now, and I believe there's more to it than what's been presented to the public,\" said Jeff McGrath, a private investigator hired by the Robinson family to aid in the search.\n\nMcGrath, who has over 25 years of experience in investigations, shared his insights with Newsweek, \"The Jeep was driven 11 miles post-crash, and there were several attempts to restart the engine. I think there's a crucial piece of information that's been overlooked.\"\n\nThe lack of progress in Daniel's case has sparked concern among social media users. Shayla Davis, a Facebook user, created an online petition calling for further investigation by the Buckeye Police Department, which has amassed over 5,700 signatures.\n\n\"It's disheartening to see how little attention Daniel's case has received,\" Davis said. \"We just want answers, and we're not going to stop until we get them.\"\n\nThe Buckeye Police Department, however, maintains that they have thoroughly searched and analyzed the evidence but have found no new leads on Daniel's whereabouts.\n\n\"We understand the concern and frustration of Daniel's family and friends,\" said Sergeant Tommy Thompson of the Buckeye Police Department. \"We're doing everything we can to bring closure to this case, but we need the public's help.

The latest high-profile victim is the Colonial Pipeline, which transports approximately 45% of the East Coast's fuel.\n\nThe solar power industry, government agencies, water treatment plants, police departments, and now pipelines have all been in the crosshairs of ransomware groups. In an interview with The Guardian, Eric Cole, author of \"Cyber Crisis\" and founder of Secure Anchor, expressed his concerns, stating, \"Ransomware attacks are becoming more widespread and sophisticated, and the consequences can be devastating.\"\n\nThe Colonial Pipeline shutdown, caused by a ransomware attack on May 7, 2021, resulted in fuel shortages and price hikes. Mark Stamford, CEO of OccamSec, noted, \"The Colonial Pipeline attack is a stark reminder that our critical infrastructure is vulnerable to these types of attacks.\"\n\nColonial Pipeline reportedly paid a $5 million ransom fee to the cybercriminal group Darkside, which took responsibility for the attack, and initiated the restart of operations. The incident signified a shift towards targeting larger organizations, as ransomware groups increasingly view the potential financial rewards as worth the risk.\n\nIn a statement, Darkside claimed responsibility for the attack, stating, \"Our goal is to make money, and we accomplish this by using modern tools to exploit vulnerabilities in computer systems.\"\n\nThe number of ransomware attacks on government agencies and private companies is rising, with many opting to pay the ransom instead of risking the potential consequences of a public data breach. According to a report by Cybersecurity Ventures, ransomware damages are projected to reach $20 billion annually by 2021.\n\nThe shift from ransom to extortion tactics signifies the evolution of cybercriminal methods, with data encryption and exfiltration becoming more common. In a statement to The Guardian, Cole explained, \"Ransomware groups are now not only encrypting data but also exfiltrating it and threatening to publish it online if the ransom is not paid.\"\n\nCybercriminals are also selling ransomware software on the dark web, increasing the potential for more attacks. In an interview with The Guardian, Stamford warned, \"Ransomware-as-a-Service is a growing trend, and it makes these attacks more accessible to less skilled cybercriminals.\"\n\nFBI and security experts have identified Darkside as a criminal group based in Russia, but U.S. President Joe Biden stated there is no evidence linking the Russian government to the attack. In response to the attack, Biden signed an executive order to strengthen the nation's cybersecurity defenses.\n\nExperts believe the recent surge in ransomware attacks, including the one on Colonial Pipeline, could be a form of marketing by cybercriminals, as they seek to expand their reach and gain notoriety. In a statement to The Guardian, Stamford said, \"Ransomware attacks are becoming more frequent and sophisticated, and it's clear that cybercriminals are becoming bolder in their tactics.\"\n\nTo mitigate the risk of ransomware attacks, experts recommend implementing strong passwords, keeping software up-to-date, and backing up data regularly. Cole added, \"Organizations must also invest in cybersecurity training for their employees, as human error is often the weakest link in a company's cybersecurity defenses.\"\n\nIn response to the Colonial Pipeline attack, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued an Emergency Directive, requiring pipeline companies to report any ransomware attacks to the agency within 24 hours. CISA Director Jen Easterly stated, \"Pipeline operators need to take immediate action to secure their systems against these threats.\"\n\nAs the threat of ransomware attacks continues to grow, organizations must remain vigilant and invest in robust cybersecurity defenses. Cole concluded, \"Ransomware attacks are a serious threat, and it's essential that organizations take the necessary steps to protect themselves and their customers.\""}

For those of us who value journalistic integrity, the incident serves as a stark reminder of the increasingly blurred lines between news and entertainment in today's media landscape.\n\nFrom a right-leaning perspective, Cuomo's departure is seen as a minor event in the grand scheme of things. After all, the once-celebrated anchor's ratings had been on a steady decline, and his agenda-driven approach to news reporting had long been a source of frustration for viewers seeking unbiased coverage.\n\nHowever, the incident is indicative of much larger issues plaguing the journalism industry. Ethical lapses and conflicts of interest have become all too common, with newsrooms increasingly prioritizing corporate, government, or entertainment interests over the public's right to know.\n\nTake, for instance, CNN's handling of Chris Cuomo's interviews with his brother, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, during the COVID-19 crisis. The network's management ignored ethical standards by allowing the anchor to engage in such conversations, creating an appearance of impropriety that further eroded public trust.\n\nThis situation reflects a wider problem of news media blending entertainment with news, leading to national confusion and polarization. As Americans struggle to discern fact from fiction, it is no wonder that public trust in the media is at a near-record low, with only a third of Americans trusting political news.\n\nThe industry's failure to adhere to journalism codes of ethics has contributed significantly to the current state of media credibility. In a time when transparency and accountability are more crucial than ever, it is disheartening to see so many journalists sacrificing their integrity for ratings or political gain.\n\nAs we move forward, it is essential that journalism's leaders prioritize the public interest above all else. This means acknowledging the role they have played in fostering ethical issues and taking concrete steps to rectify them.\n\nFirst and foremost, news organizations must adopt and adhere to strict ethical guidelines. These should include clear policies on conflicts of interest, transparency in sourcing and reporting, and a commitment to fairness and balance.\n\nAdditionally, journalists must be held accountable for their actions. This may involve disciplinary measures, public apologies, or even termination in egregious cases.\n\nCuomo's case could serve as a catalyst for a much-needed reinvention of the news industry. If leaders in media take a visionary approach and commit to upholding journalistic standards, they may be able to regain the public trust that has been eroded over the years.\n\nIn conclusion, the dismissal of Chris Cuomo from CNN is a minor event in the grand scheme of things. However, it serves as a reminder of the broader ethical issues plaguing the journalism industry. As we move forward, it is essential that media leaders prioritize the public interest and take concrete steps to uphold journalistic standards. Only then can we hope to restore public trust in the media and create a more informed, engaged, and ethical society."}

This mandate comes in response to the Biden administration's September announcement requiring healthcare providers and large employers to implement vaccination policies.\n\nDr. Mark Briesacher, Intermountain Healthcare's chief physician executive, explained the necessity of this step in a press release: \"As the leading healthcare system in Utah, Intermountain Healthcare is committed to ensuring the safety of our patients, their families, and our workforce. With the impending federal requirements, we believe this is the most effective way to continue providing uninterrupted care to our patients with federal health insurance.\"\n\nAccording to Intermountain Healthcare, approximately 80% of its care providers are already fully vaccinated. The organization will allow employees to seek exemptions for medical or religious reasons, similar to other vaccination requirements. Unvaccinated employees without exemptions will face administrative leave starting Jan. 5, and potential separation from the organization by Feb. 9.\n\nThe number of employees who may choose to quit or be fired rather than comply with the vaccine mandate remains uncertain. Intermountain Healthcare employs over 40,000 people across Utah and Idaho.\n\nBrad Wilson, Speaker of the Utah House of Representatives, expressed concern about the potential impact of the mandate on Utah's healthcare workforce during a press conference last week: \"Intermountain's decision will undoubtedly disrupt our healthcare system, and we are actively exploring all options to mitigate this situation. However, the federal funding that Intermountain receives makes it difficult for the state to effectively intervene.\"\n\nOther healthcare providers in Utah, including University of Utah Health, have already required employee vaccinations. In August, University of Utah Health announced that all employees, students, and volunteers must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by Dec. 8, 2021.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) confirmed in a statement that healthcare providers that fail to comply with the federal vaccination requirements will no longer be eligible for reimbursement under the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\n\n\"CMS is taking this action to ensure that patients are protected against COVID-19 and that healthcare personnel are fully vaccinated,\" the statement read.\n\nIn September, President Joe Biden announced that, under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), businesses with over 100 employees would be required to ensure their workforce is fully vaccinated or undergo weekly COVID-19 testing. Large healthcare providers, such as Intermountain Healthcare, were already subject to CMS's mandate.\n\nIn response to the federal requirements, Intermountain Healthcare stated, \"We believe this is the most effective way to protect our patients, their families, and our workforce while continuing to provide uninterrupted care to our patients with federal health insurance.\"\n\nAs of now, it is unclear how other large healthcare providers and employers in Utah will respond to the federal vaccine requirements. However, the implications of these mandates on Utah's healthcare workforce and economy are significant.\n\nIn conclusion, Intermountain Healthcare's decision to mandate COVID-19 vaccines for its employees to maintain federal funding marks a crucial step in Utah's fight against the ongoing pandemic. With over 80% of care providers already vaccinated, the organization aims to ensure the safety and well-being of its patients and workforce. However, the potential impact on Utah's healthcare system and workforce remains to be seen.\n\nDr. Mark Briesacher, Intermountain Healthcare's chief physician executive, emphasized the importance of the vaccine mandate: \"This decision is in the best interest of our patients, their families, and our workforce. We are committed to providing uninterrupted care to our patients with federal health insurance, and this step is necessary to do so.\"\n\nAs the situation continues to evolve, Utah's healthcare providers and policymakers will need to work together to find solutions that prioritize patient care, workforce stability, and public health.\n\n\"We understand that this is a challenging time for many of our employees, and we are committed to working with them through this process,\" Dr. Briesacher added. \"Our top priority remains the health and well-being of our patients and our workforce.\"\n\nBrad Wilson, Utah Speaker, voiced his concerns about the potential impact of the mandate on Utah's healthcare workforce: \"Intermountain's decision will undoubtedly disrupt our healthcare system, and we are actively exploring all options to mitigate this situation. However, the federal funding that Intermountain receives makes it difficult for the state to effectively intervene.\""}

Phaahla expressed concern, stating, \"This is a new variant, we have named it B.1.1.529, and it's a concern because of the mutations that it has.\"\n\nGenomic scientists have noted that this variant possesses an unusually high number of mutations in the spike protein, which could potentially evade immune responses and increase transmissibility. Tulio de Oliveira, the director of South Africa's Center for Epidemic Response and Innovation, warned, \"The variant has a very high number of mutations. It's concerning because it can potentially reduce the effectiveness of vaccines and make diagnosis more challenging.\"\n\nThis new variant has already been detected in Botswana and a traveler to Hong Kong from South Africa. De Oliveira emphasized the fast spread of the variant, stating, \"It's spreading very quickly in Gauteng, which is the economic hub of South Africa.\"\n\nThe UK responded to this news by banning flights from South Africa, Namibia, Lesotho, Botswana, Eswatini, and Zimbabwe, adding them to the red list on November 26, 2021. UK Health Minister Sajid Javid stated, \"This variant might be more transmissible than the delta variant and may reduce vaccine efficacy.\"\n\nIt is too soon to determine the impact on vaccine efficacy and clinical severity compared to previous variants, with further research needed. Phaahla stated, \"We don't have enough information yet about the impact of this variant on vaccine efficacy or on the clinical severity of the disease.\"\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has classified the new variant, B.1.1.529, as a 'variant under monitoring.' Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO's COVID-19 Technical Lead, said in a press conference, \"We don't yet understand transmission dynamics, the severity of disease, or the effectiveness of tests, treatments, and vaccines against this variant.\"\n\nSouth Africa is approaching a predicted fourth wave due to slow vaccine uptake, amid relatively low current infection rates. Phaahla stated, \"We need to step up our vaccination efforts to protect ourselves from new waves of the virus.\" As of November 25, 2021, only about 23% of South Africa's population is fully vaccinated against COVID-19."}

Other leading causes of death included vehicle crashes on icy roads, carbon monoxide poisoning from malfunctioning heating sources, and complications from chronic medical conditions exacerbated by the extreme weather.\n\nThe winter storm, which struck Texas in late February, left millions without power for days. Homes and businesses across the state were plunged into darkness and freezing temperatures, forcing many residents to seek refuge in emergency shelters or with friends and family.\n\nHarris County, which includes Houston, reported the highest number of storm-related fatalities at 43. Travis County, home to Austin, followed closely with 28 deaths, while Dallas County reported 20 deaths.\n\nThe DSHS acknowledges that the official death toll may be an underestimation. As more information becomes available, the department plans to continue updating the number of storm-related fatalities.\n\nBuzzfeed News analysis suggests the actual number of deaths could exceed 700, significantly higher than the official count. The discrepancy highlights the challenge of accurately assessing the impact of a disaster as vast and complex as the Texas winter storm.\n\nThe winter storm exposed significant deficiencies in Texas' electric system, leading to widespread power outages that lasted for days. The failure of the power grid highlighted the need for reforms and upgrades to ensure the reliability and resilience of the state's energy infrastructure.\n\nIn response to the crisis, the Texas legislature passed legislation to increase the reliability of the state's power grid. The new law, which took effect in September, includes measures to strengthen grid infrastructure, expand renewable energy sources, and improve communication and coordination between utility companies and state officials.\n\nHowever, some critics argue that the legislation was insufficient. They call for more comprehensive reforms, including investments in energy storage and a more robust regulatory framework to ensure the grid can withstand extreme weather events.\n\nGovernor Greg Abbott faces criticism for not including grid reforms in the special legislative session agenda earlier in the year. The delay in addressing the issue has raised questions about the governor's priorities and the state's preparedness for future weather emergencies. Despite the controversy, Abbott has maintained that the new legislation represents a significant step forward in strengthening Texas' power grid."}

The proposal for $2,000 checks was a key issue in the Georgia run-off elections, where both President Trump and President-elect Joe Biden called for the larger payments.\n\nThe federal government has previously sent two rounds of stimulus checks, up to $1,200 and $600, to eligible Americans. The new stimulus bill aims to supplement the $600 payments with an additional $1,400, alongside funding for vaccine distribution, small businesses, schools, and state and local governments.\n\nHowever, not all Democrats are on board with the idea of sending Americans $2,000 stimulus checks. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), a moderate Democrat, has expressed his opposition to the idea.\n\n\"I've always believed that the best social policy is a good-paying job,\" Manchin said in a statement on Tuesday. \"Before we write another check, I want to see us get our people back to work through a targeted and effective approach.\"\n\nManchin also questioned the employment benefits of additional checks, stating, \"We cannot continue to support Americans by putting a band-aid on the issue. We must address the root cause of this crisis: getting people back to work.\"\n\nThe approval of another massive relief bill is uncertain due to potential lack of support from some Democrats, including Manchin.

However, not everyone who received a payment was eligible, and some may have received more than they were entitled to. In this article, we'll go over the key points regarding third stimulus check payments, including how to return payments if necessary, eligibility requirements, and more.\n\nRecipients who received a payment in error or were overpaid may be required to return the money. The process for returning stimulus payments depends on the payment method: paper checks, Economic Impact Payment (EIP) cards, or direct deposit.\n\nFor those who received paper checks, they should make a check or money order payable to \"U.S. Treasury\" and write \"2021StimulusPayment\" and their Social Security number or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) on the back. They should then mail it to the address provided by the IRS, along with a letter explaining the reason for returning the payment.\n\nThose who received EIP cards and wish to return their payment should call the number on the back of the card to request a deactivation. They should then destroy the card and keep the receipt as proof of return.\n\nFor direct deposits, recipients can log into their online banking account and follow the instructions provided by their bank to return the payment. They should also notify the IRS using the \"Non-Filers: Enter Payment Info Here\" tool on IRS.gov.\n\nIncome cutoffs for the third stimulus check were $80,000 for individuals, $120,000 for heads of household, and $160,000 for married couples filing jointly. However, those whose income increased in 2021 compared to their 2020 tax year may not have to return payments received before filing their 2020 taxes.\n\nPeople who were ineligible for the third stimulus check include the deceased, nonresidents without a U.S. citizen spouse, noncitizens who file federal taxes, dependents, and recipients of duplicate payments.\n\nFor deceased family members, the return of payments depends on the filer's status and the tax year the IRS based the payment on. If the payment was issued based on a joint return and one spouse is still alive, they may keep the payment. If the payment was issued to an individual who is now deceased, the payment must be returned.\n\nTo return a cashed check, recipients should make a check or money order payable to \"U.S. Treasury\" and write \"2021StimulusPayment\" and their Social Security number or ITIN on the back. They should then mail it to the address provided by the IRS, along with a letter explaining the reason for returning the payment.\n\nFor uncashed checks, recipients should write \"VOID\" on the back and return it to the IRS with an explanation.\n\nThose who are missing their first or second stimulus payments may claim them as a Recovery Rebate Credit on their 2020 taxes.\n\nIt's important to note that there are scams targeting individuals who have received stimulus payments. The IRS will never call, text, or email to request personal or financial information.\n\nAdditionally, the IRS does not use social media to contact taxpayers about stimulus payments or other tax-related issues.\n\nThe IRS also does not charge a fee for help with stimulus payments or taxes. Those who need assistance can contact the IRS at 1-800-829-1040.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan Act also expanded the Child Tax Credit (CTC) and the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) for 2021. Eligible families may receive advance payments of up to $300 per month per child under the age of 6 and up to $250 per month per child between the ages of 6 and 17.\n\nThe expanded CTC and EITC are advance payments of tax credits that will be calculated based on a taxpayer's 2021 income. Recipients will need to file a 2021 tax return to determine their final eligibility and credit amount.\n\nThe IRS encourages taxpayers to use its online tools, such as the \"Get My Payment\" tool and the \"Child Tax Credit Update Portal,\" to check the status of their stimulus payments and advance CTC payments.\n\nTo be eligible for the third stimulus check, individuals must have a valid Social Security number, be a U.S. citizen or resident alien, and not be claimed as a dependent on someone else's tax return.\n\nThe third stimulus check also includes \"plus-up\" payments for those who received less than the full amount based on their 2020 tax return but are now eligible for more due to a change in income or household size."}

As the storm hit the same day as the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina and just two days after the anniversary of Hurricane Laura, residents braced themselves for the severe challenges that lay ahead.\n\nLouisiana Governor John Bel Edwards acknowledged the difficulties the state would face in the coming days and weeks during a press conference. \"We are bracing ourselves for a long-term recovery,\" Edwards said, emphasizing the importance of remaining vigilant and following safety protocols.\n\nEdwards urged residents in southeastern Louisiana to shelter in place for at least 72 hours after the storm had passed. The entire Louisiana National Guard, in addition to personnel from 16 other states, was mobilized for search and rescue missions.\n\nCoastal towns bore the brunt of Hurricane Ida's wrath, with more populous areas such as New Orleans and Baton Rouge expected to face significant impacts. LaToya Cantrell, the Mayor of New Orleans, emphasized the importance of staying informed and taking necessary precautions. \"Residents should have a plan in place and be prepared for extended power outages,\" Cantrell said.\n\nDespite mandatory evacuations in many coastal parishes, New Orleans did not issue a mandatory evacuation order due to the storm's rapid approach. Instead, the city focused on improving its hurricane preparedness since Hurricane Katrina, which devastated the area in 2005.\n\nSince Katrina, Louisiana has implemented a new protection system around New Orleans, which includes a strengthened levee system and improved drainage infrastructure. \"We've come a long way since Hurricane Katrina,\" Edwards said. \"But we still have work to do.\"\n\nHospitals in the region, already strained by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, faced challenges in evacuation and potential power outages. Louisiana Health Secretary, Dr. Courtney Phillips, assured residents that hospitals were preparing for the storm's impact and would remain operational if possible.\n\nTo mitigate the spread of COVID-19 among evacuees, Louisiana was providing public shelters and transportation to safer areas. The state also implemented safety protocols such as social distancing, mask-wearing, and temperature checks.\n\nAs Hurricane Ida struck, residents and emergency responders worked together to ensure the safety and well-being of those in the storm's path. \"We'll get through this together,\" Edwards said. \"Louisiana is a strong and resilient state, and we'll come out of this stronger than ever before.\"\n\nDespite the challenges, there were moments of hope and solidarity. Neighbors checked on one another, offering assistance and support. Volunteers and relief organizations arrived from across the country to lend a helping hand.\n\nAs the sun rose on the morning following Hurricane Ida's landfall, the full extent of the damage became clear.

However, the company warned investors about slower revenue growth in the third and fourth quarters, sending its shares tumbling in after-hours trading.\n\nDuring a conference call, Chief Financial Officer Dave Wehner stated, \"We currently expect our revenue growth rates to decelerate substantially in the second half of 2021, and we now anticipate that our revenue growth rate will be significantly lower in 2022 than in 2021.\"\n\nDespite these concerns, Facebook's Q2 revenue reached a staggering $29.07 billion, representing a 56% year-over-year increase. Earnings per share came in at $3.61, surpassing Wall Street's expectations.\n\nFacebook's user base continued to expand, with 2.9 billion people visiting the platform monthly, marking a 7% increase from the previous year.\n\nHowever, the company has faced mounting criticism for its handling of false claims about coronavirus vaccines. In response, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's CEO, stated during the earnings call, \"We're working closely with health experts and fact-checkers to provide accurate information to our community.\"\n\nZuckerberg added, \"We direct people to authoritative sources, and we've removed over 3 million pieces of content for violating our policies against misinformation related to COVID-19 and vaccines.\"\n\nDespite Facebook's efforts, their stock dropped more than 4% in after-hours trading. The decline can be partially attributed to concerns over the company's ability to monetize its content in the face of growing privacy regulations and user privacy concerns.\n\nMonthly active users in Europe dropped by 2 million, while US numbers remained flat. This trend could put pressure on Facebook's ability to generate revenue from its European user base.\n\nAdditionally, Apple's new privacy features have raised questions about Facebook's ad targeting capabilities. \"Apple's privacy changes represent a significant headwind for our business,\" Wehner acknowledged during the call.\n\nIn an effort to counter these challenges, Facebook announced plans to invest over $1 billion in creators and introduced new features to support them. Zuckerberg emphasized the importance of the 'metaverse' and digital expression during the call, stating, \"We believe the metaverse will be the next major computing platform, and it will be powered by social experiences.\"\n\nZuckerberg continued, \"Our focus is on building a community where people feel connected, safe, and free to express themselves, and we're committed to doing this in a way that benefits all members of our community.\""}

However, in recent times, his favorability has taken a hit, opening up an opportunity for anti-monarchists to gain ground. The declining popularity of the future king, coupled with revelations from Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey, has sparked debates on the relevance and values of the monarchy, especially among young people and people of color.\n\nAnna Pasternak, a royal biographer, shares her perspective on the situation, \"Prince Charles' image has been tarnished in the public eye, and it's no secret that his relationship with his sons has been strained. The monarchy's survival hinges on its ability to adapt and connect with the modern world.\"\n\nGraham Smith, CEO of Republic, an organization campaigning for an elected head of state, elaborates on the momentum gained by the republican movement, \"The interview with Oprah has highlighted the internal conflicts within the royal family and the lack of relevance the monarchy holds for many people in the UK and beyond.

Prince Charles' waning popularity and the fallout from Harry and Meghan's interview have brought into question his ability to lead and the monarchy's ability to resonate with modern values.\"\n\nThe Buckingham Palace response to the interview was to address issues privately, maintaining the family aspect of the controversy. However, this approach has done little to quell the public outrage and debate.\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan's decision to leave the UK and step down as senior royals has brought the monarchy's future into sharp focus. The incident raises questions about Prince Charles' future as king and the monarchy's ability to adapt to the modern world.\n\nDespite the mounting pressure, not everyone is calling for an end to the monarchy. Some argue that it plays an essential role in British history and culture. However, public opinion remains divided, with a growing number of people advocating for an elected head of state.\n\nAnna Pasternak concludes, \"The monarchy's survival hinges on its ability to adapt to the changing times and connect with the modern world. The revelations from Harry and Meghan's interview and Prince Charles' waning popularity have presented a significant challenge. Only time will tell if the monarchy can rise to it.\"\n\nGraham Smith adds, \"The republican movement has gained momentum, and it's clear that the monarchy's future is uncertain.

Yet, away from the public eye, Powell found solace and joy in the simple act of fixing things, particularly cars, in his garage.\n\n\"Colin was a man of many parts,\" recalled Richard Armitage, Powell's longtime friend and deputy secretary of state. \"He was a military leader, a diplomat, a family man, and an accomplished mechanic.\"\n\nPowell's penchant for fixing things was rooted in a deep sense of frugality, curiosity, and a drive to repair rather than discard. Michael Powell, his son, remembered his father's determination to fix a batch of defective adding machines during his time as a young Army officer.\n\n\"Dad spent hours tinkering with those machines, trying to figure out what was wrong,\" Michael said. \"He never gave up, and in the end, he managed to get them working again.\"\n\nPowell's career was marked by a swift rise to become a four-star general and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, embodying what came to be known as the 'Powell doctrine': a military strategy favoring overwhelming force and clear objectives.\n\nHowever, during his tenure as secretary of state under George W. Bush, Powell faced a dilemma. The decision to invade Iraq, which contradicted the Powell doctrine, weighed heavily on him.\n\n\"He knew it would be a long and difficult war,\" Peggy Cifrino, Powell's longtime assistant, said. \"But he believed in the mission and felt it was the right thing to do.\"\n\nRegretting his UN speech that falsely claimed Saddam Hussein had illicit weapons, Powell considered it the biggest mistake of his career. \"He knew the intelligence was flawed, but he felt pressure to present it to the world,\" Cifrino added.\n\nAfter leaving the Bush administration, Powell remained influential, advising foreign diplomats and leaders, and engaging in private sector and educational activities.

The 45-year-old athlete was transferred from Harbor-UCLA Medical Center to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for continuing orthopedic care and recovery.\n\nDr. Anish Mahajan, Interim CEO and Chief Medical Officer at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, confirmed Woods underwent emergency surgery on his right leg. \"Mr. Woods suffered significant orthopedic injuries to his right lower extremity. He underwent a lengthy surgical procedure during which an open fracture affecting both the upper and lower portion of the tibia and fibula was stabilized with a combination of screws and pins,\" Mahajan stated.\n\nWoods' team reported that the golf icon is now recovering and in good spirits after follow-up procedures. The athlete's wife, Elin Nordegren, was by his side at the hospital.\n\nLos Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva confirmed that Woods was not impaired or under the influence at the time of the crash. \"The primary cause of the single-vehicle rollover was driving at a high rate of speed,\" Villanueva said.\n\nThe cities of Rolling Hills and Rancho Palos Verdes could be liable for the stretch of road where Woods crashed due to its slope and curves, according to attorney Marvin Mitchelson, who has represented clients in similar cases.\n\nOn the day of the crash, Woods was headed to a video shoot with NFL QBs Drew Brees and Justin Herbert.\n\nThe crash site is notorious for accidents, with a history of wrecks dating back to 2006. Woods' vehicle crossed the center median and rolled over several times, coming to a halt on the edge of the road.\n\nWoods was driving a Genesis GV80, with the car's 'black box' possibly providing details of the crash.\n\nWoods faces a lengthy recovery process from his injuries, adding to a history of physical health issues since 2008. He underwent back surgery in 2017 following a DUI arrest, and in 2019, he underwent another back procedure.\n\n\"This is obviously a difficult time for Tiger and his family,\" Woods' agent Mark Steinberg said in a statement. \"We ask for privacy during this time.\"\n\nAccording to Villanueva, Woods was wearing his seatbelt at the time of the crash, which likely saved his life. The sheriff also mentioned that Woods' injuries could have been much worse if he hadn't been wearing the seatbelt.\n\nWoods' team released a statement thanking the first responders, medical professionals, and the community for their support. \"On behalf of Tiger and his family, we want to express our gratitude to the excellent doctors and nurses looking after him, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, and the Fire and Rescue Departments for their care and professionalism,\" the statement read.\n\nMahajan emphasized the importance of following traffic laws and taking safety precautions while driving. \"We all have a responsibility to prioritize safety, whether we're behind the wheel or cheering on our favorite athletes,\" Mahajan said. \"I urge everyone to take this message to heart and drive responsibly.\""}

Motivated by a deep-rooted belief in serving his country, Young enlisted in the Army and was soon deployed to Iraq. However, as his story unfolded, it became a poignant reminder of the human cost of war and an unwavering call for peace.\n\nYoung's experiences in Iraq began to challenge his belief in the legitimacy of the war. Five days post-deployment, he was shot and paralyzed from the waist down. The bullets that ended his military career also shattered the dreams of the young soldier who had once dreamed of a career in the Marines.\n\nAs Tomas grappled with the harsh realities of life as a paraplegic, he became a significant antiwar activist. His story was immortalized in the documentary \"Body of War,\" which highlighted his struggles and activism. The film, which premiered at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival, offered a stark reminder of the human toll of war.\n\nTom Morello, the legendary guitarist of Rage Against the Machine, befriended Young during his activism. Morello, known for his politically charged music and activism, saw in Tomas a kindred spirit and offered his support, including providing a song for Young's documentary. Their friendship was a powerful symbol of solidarity in the face of war and the injustices it wrought.\n\nTomas' crusade against war extended beyond his activism. He advocated tirelessly for veteran care and peace, using his platform to shed light on the damages and injustices wrought by the Iraq War. Refusing special treatment, he lived as modestly as other veterans, underlining his solidarity and ethical stance against war profiteering.\n\nThe weight of Tomas' injuries, coupled with the emotional toll of his activism, led him to contemplate suicide. However, he ultimately chose to make a final statement through a public letter to George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, accusing them of war crimes and moral culpability for the deaths and suffering of soldiers and civilians. Tomas' letter was a powerful testament to the courage and resilience of a man who continued to fight, even in the face of insurmountable odds.\n\nTom Morello honored Tomas' memory with performances and discussed the impact of his activism and their friendship. Morello, who has long used his music as a platform for protest and social justice, continues to speak on the role of music in protest movements, keeping alive the spirit of Tomas Young's activism.\n\nTomas Young's story is a powerful reminder of the human cost of war and the unyielding courage of those who refuse to be silenced in the face of injustice. His legacy continues to inspire and challenge us to reconsider the true cost of war and to strive for a more just and peaceful world.\n\nThrough his activism, Tomas Young demonstrated that even in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds, one person can make a difference. His story is a testament to the power of the human spirit and the importance of standing up for what is right, no matter the personal cost.\n\nAs we reflect on Tomas' life and legacy, let us honor his memory by continuing to fight for peace and justice, both at home and abroad. Let us remember the sacrifices made by soldiers like Tomas, and let us work towards a world where such sacrifices are no longer necessary.\n\nTomas Young's story is a poignant reminder of the human cost of war and the unyielding courage of those who refuse to be silenced in the face of injustice.

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and heightened security concerns following the January 6 insurrection, this inauguration promises to be unlike any other in American history.\n\nMore than 25,000 National Guard soldiers have been deployed in Washington, D.C., to secure the city. Fencing and barricades have been erected around the Capitol grounds, and the National Mall, where large crowds typically gather for inaugurations, is closed to the public.\n\nIn place of the traditional black-tie inaugural balls, a star-studded virtual concert, \"Celebrating America,\" hosted by Tom Hanks, will entertain the nation and raise funds for COVID-19 relief. The event, which will air on multiple networks and streaming platforms, will include performances by artists such as Demi Lovato, Jon Bon Jovi, and Justin Timberlake.\n\nIn the days leading up to the inauguration, a memorial for coronavirus victims will be held at the Reflecting Pool on the National Mall, followed by several days of virtual programming focusing on the themes of unity, healing, and renewal.\n\nSecurity concerns have prompted changes to Biden's travel plans and the postponement of the inauguration rehearsal. Instead of traveling from Wilmington, Delaware, to Washington, D.C., by train, Biden will make the journey by motorcade.\n\nAbout 1,000 guests, including former Presidents Obama, Bush, and Clinton, along with their spouses, are expected to attend the inauguration ceremony in person. Former President Trump, who has refused to acknowledge Biden's victory, will not be in attendance.\n\nFollowing the ceremony, Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will participate in a Pass in Review, a military tradition symbolizing the peaceful transfer of power. They will then visit Arlington National Cemetery to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.\n\nInstead of the traditional inaugural parade, a virtual parade featuring performances from around the country will be broadcast on television and streaming platforms. Lady Gaga will sing the National Anthem, and Jennifer Lopez will perform at the ceremony.\n\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic and security concerns have forced numerous changes to the inauguration proceedings, Biden has remained focused on the importance of the day, stating, \"This inauguration marks a new chapter in American history, one that will be marked by healing and unity.\"\n\nAs the inauguration approaches, many Americans are looking forward to witnessing this historic event, despite the unconventional format. The pandemic and security concerns have presented unprecedented challenges, but the spirit of resilience and determination that defines the American people remains strong.\n\nAfter a tumultuous and divisive year, the inauguration of Joe Biden as the 46th President of the United States represents an opportunity for the nation to come together and begin the process of healing and moving forward.\n\nThe virtual nature of the inauguration, while different from past ceremonies, allows for greater access and inclusivity. Millions of people from around the world will be able to witness the event in real-time, fostering a sense of unity and shared experience.\n\nThe presence of the National Guard soldiers in Washington, D.C., is a reminder of the importance of security and the rule of law. Their presence is a testament to the dedication of the men and women who serve our country and protect our democratic institutions.\n\nThe memorial for coronavirus victims is a poignant reminder of the sacrifices made during the pandemic. It is a tribute to the more than 400,000 Americans who have lost their lives to COVID-19 and a reminder of the importance of continuing to prioritize public health and safety.\n\nThe virtual concert, \"Celebrating America,\" is an opportunity for the nation to come together and celebrate the resilience and strength of the American people. It is a reminder that even in the darkest of times, we can find hope and joy through the power of music and the arts.\n\nThe days of virtual programming leading up to the inauguration are a testament to the creativity and adaptability of the American people. They show that even in the face of unprecedented challenges, we can find ways to connect and engage with one another.\n\nThe Pass in Review and visit to Arlington National Cemetery are important symbols of the peaceful transfer of power and the sacrifices made by our military personnel. These events remind us of the importance of honoring our history and the men and women who have served our country.\n\nLady Gaga's performance of the National Anthem and Jennifer Lopez's performance at the ceremony are exciting moments for music fans and a reminder of the power of art to bring people together and inspire hope.\n\nThe \"Celebrating America\" TV special is an opportunity for Biden and Harris to connect with the American people and share their vision for the future.

The president's visit followed the devastation left in the storm's wake, leaving over a million people without power and another 600,000 without water.\n\nDuring his visit, Biden met with Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards and local officials to discuss the hurricane's impact. \"The devastation is overwhelming, and it's going to take a long time to rebuild,\" Edwards told reporters during a press conference with Biden.\n\nHurricane Ida is the fifth most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, causing extensive damage and power outages. At least nine people have died in Louisiana due to the storm, and at least 46 people have lost their lives along the East Coast.\n\nPower restoration efforts in Louisiana have made progress, reducing the number of homes and businesses without power to around 823,000 as of September 4. Still, it could take weeks or even months for power to be fully restored in some areas.\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy announced on September 4 that the state's death toll from Hurricane Ida's impacts had risen to 25, with at least six people still missing. Ida made landfall in New Jersey on September 1 as a tropical storm, causing widespread flooding and power outages.\n\nBiden toured damage in Louisiana communities such as LaPlace and emphasized the need for infrastructure improvements. \"We're going to make sure that the infrastructure is built back better than ever before,\" Biden said during a press conference in Louisiana.\n\nBiden's infrastructure plan includes investments in burying power lines underground to prevent future outages. \"Buried power lines are not only more resilient to extreme weather events, they're also safer for communities,\" Biden said.\n\nThe president also approved emergency declarations for New Jersey and New York, providing federal assistance for response efforts in those states. \"We'll be there every step of the way,\" Biden said.\n\nEdwards expressed gratitude for the federal assistance and praised Biden's quick response. \"I appreciate the presence of the president here in Louisiana today,\" Edwards said. \"He understands the importance of getting help to the people who need it most.\"\n\nU.S. Senator Bill Cassidy (R-LA) also praised Biden's visit and the federal assistance. \"It's good to have the president here to show his support and to see the damage firsthand,\" Cassidy said in a statement.\n\nBiden's visit to Louisiana came as parts of the state remained under a boil water advisory due to contaminated water systems. Edwards urged residents to be patient as crews worked to restore water service.\n\nThe National Guard and other emergency responders continued to search for survivors and assess damage in affected areas. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) had deployed more than 2,000 personnel to Louisiana and other affected states.\n\nBiden emphasized the importance of rebuilding infrastructure to withstand future storms. \"We have to make sure we're investing in the infrastructure that can withstand the storms of the future,\" Biden said.\n\nEdwards thanked Biden for his commitment to rebuilding Louisiana's infrastructure. \"We're grateful for the president's leadership and his commitment to working with us to rebuild Louisiana stronger than ever before,\" Edwards said.\n\nBiden's visit to Louisiana marked his third trip to the state since taking office in January 2021. The president had previously visited Louisiana to tour the damage caused by a winter storm and to meet with oil industry leaders.\n\nIda's impact extended beyond Louisiana and the East Coast, with damage reported in several other states, including Arkansas, Mississippi, and Tennessee. The storm caused billions of dollars in damage and economic losses.\n\nBiden's infrastructure plan, which includes investments in climate resilience and infrastructure improvements, could provide a significant boost to rebuilding efforts in storm-ravaged areas. However, the plan faces opposition from some Republicans in Congress.\n\nEdwards urged Congress to pass the infrastructure bill, emphasizing the importance of investments in climate resilience and infrastructure improvements. \"We need Congress to act,\" Edwards said. \"We can't afford to wait any longer.\"\n\nBiden's visit to Louisiana marked a significant moment in the response to Hurricane Ida, demonstrating the federal government's commitment to supporting affected communities and rebuilding infrastructure.\n\nAs Biden left Louisiana, he reiterated his commitment to helping the state rebuild. \"We're going to be there every step of the way,\" Biden said. \"We're going to make sure that Louisiana comes back stronger than ever before.\""}

Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in turn, appointed two Republicans critical of former President Donald Trump to the commission.\n\n\"This select committee is designed to be political,\" McCarthy stated. \"The American people see through this charade.\"\n\nFive people lost their lives, and dozens of police officers were wounded during the insurrection instigated by Trump's false claims that the November 2020 election was stolen. Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn, one of the officers scheduled to testify, shared his perspective on the harrowing day.\n\n\"I had never experienced anything like that in my career,\" Dunn recalled. \"The mob was relentless, attacking us with fists, bats, and other weapons. It was chaos.\"\n\nCapitol Police Officer Aquilino Gonell, who suffered a heart attack during the riot, echoed Dunn's sentiments: \"I have dedicated my life to serving and protecting this country, but on January 6, I was assaulted and left for dead.

Instead, we will be holding a press conference to shed light on the egregious treatment of those who were arrested.\"\n\nAs the investigation continues, the testimonies of these officers will undoubtedly provide crucial insight into the events of January 6, 2021, and the ongoing debate over the depth of the investigation remains a contentious issue in American politics.\n\nRaskin emphasized the importance of the officers' testimonies, stating, \"The American people deserve the truth about what happened on January 6, and the testimonies of these brave officers will help us get to the bottom of it.\""}

Senator Richard Blumenthal (Connecticut Democrat) voiced his concerns, emphasizing the need for Big Tech reform following the violent events.\n\nSenator Blumenthal stated, \"The storming of the Capitol was the culmination of a month of disinformation and incitement to violence on social media. It's long past time for Congress to take action against Big Tech and hold these companies accountable for the harm they cause.\"\n\nLawmakers and civil rights groups are considering measures for more transparency and stricter content policing on social media platforms. Jessica Gonzalez, Co-Chief Executive Officer of Free Press, a media reform organization, stated, \"Social media companies have a responsibility to protect the public from misinformation and harmful content, especially during times of crisis.\"\n\nHouse Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson (Mississippi Democrat) also weighed in, stating, \"It's clear that social media platforms have not done enough to prevent the spread of disinformation and hate speech. It's time for Congress to step in and regulate these companies to protect our democracy.\"\n\nWhile social media platforms have taken steps to limit Trump's reach, including temporary bans and content removal, calls for permanent suspension of his accounts are growing among lawmakers and civil rights advocates. Judd Deere, White House Spokesman, responded, \"President Trump has the right to free speech under the First Amendment. It's up to the social media companies to enforce their policies, not the government.\"\n\nCivil rights leaders have pushed for the elimination of misleading election content, highlighting its impact on electoral confidence. Laura Murphy, Civil Liberties Advocate, stated, \"The spread of misinformation and hate speech on social media can have a profound impact on our democracy. It's essential that social media companies take action to prevent this from happening.\"\n\nLegislative efforts, such as the Honest Ads Act, aim to tackle election interference and the spread of disinformation online. The Act, which has bipartisan support, would require social media companies to maintain a public file of election-related ads and disclose information about the purchasers.\n\nSocial media companies have struggled to consistently police Trump's posts, balancing policy enforcement with public interest. Facebook and Twitter were criticized for their late response and perceived opportunism in handling Trump's posts. In a statement, a Facebook spokesperson said, \"We continue to review our policies to ensure they are enforced consistently and fairly, regardless of political affiliation.\"\n\nTwitter, which temporarily suspended Trump's account following the Capitol incident, later reinstated it with a warning label. The company stated, \"We believe it is in the public's interest for the Twitter account @realDonaldTrump to remain accessible while certain controversial tweets that violate our rules remain deleted.\"\n\nDespite the criticism, some argue that banning Trump's accounts would set a dangerous precedent and infringe on free speech rights. The debate over social media regulation and the role of Big Tech in democracy continues as lawmakers, civil rights groups, and the public grapple with the impact of disinformation and hate speech on social media platforms."}

Payments would gradually reduce for individuals with an adjusted gross income (AGI) over $75,000 and married couples with an AGI over $150,000, adjusting with the number of dependents.\n\nThe IRS used 2019 tax returns to determine eligibility for the second round of checks. With Biden's new plan, eligibility for the payment would be determined based on the most recent tax return and adjusted gross income. \"Our plan puts more money in the pockets of the American people who need it most, while ensuring that those who make more pay their fair share,\" Biden emphasized.\n\nAmerica's poorest families would see a significant increase in income, with the lowest 20% of households experiencing a 29% income increase with the $2,000 checks. \"This relief will not only help families pay their bills and put food on the table but will also provide a bridge to a stronger economic recovery,\" Biden explained.\n\nFor comparison, the current $600 payment raises income for the same group by 8%, and the $1,200 CARES Act payments increased it by 11%. With the new $2,000 relief, the lowest-income households will experience a more substantial increase in disposable income.\n\nBiden's plan also includes provisions for small businesses, schools, vaccine distribution, and rental assistance. \"Our plan will put America on a better path to beating this virus, getting our kids back to school, and getting our economy back on track,\" Biden pledged.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) expressed his support for Biden's plan, stating, \"The American people are in crisis, and Joe Biden's plan will meet that crisis head-on with the bold, decisive action we need.\" Republicans, however, have criticized the price tag of the plan, with Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) stating, \"We cannot keep borrowing and spending at this level.\"\n\nBiden remains optimistic about the plan's prospects, emphasizing, \"We have a unique opportunity to rebuild the backbone of this nation, and that's exactly what our American Rescue Plan will do.\" The Senate is expected to begin consideration of the bill in the coming weeks."}

Having recently purchased a residence in the prestigious gated community of Indian Creek Island, also known as \"Billionaire's Bunker,\" the couple now faces challenges being accepted into the Indian Creek Country Club. With a membership roster boasting the who's who of the business and social elite, the club's admissions process is notoriously selective and controversial.\n\nThe couple's application to join the Indian Creek Country Club has already stirred up contentious debates among the club's members. The admissions process at the country club requires a nomination and a formal application, which can be vetoed by a single objector. In the wake of the January 6 Capitol events, many members have voiced objections to the Trumps and Kushners joining their ranks. Their presence could potentially tarnish the club's reputation, which prides itself on maintaining a low-key and discreet profile.\n\nDespite these challenges, the couple has been warmly welcomed by the community of Miami's Billionaire's Bunker. Ivanka and Jared have reportedly received numerous dinner invitations from the largely Republican enclave. Their proximity to Mar-a-Lago, where former President Donald Trump and Melania Trump may spend their post-presidential life, further cements their place in the community. Additionally, Jared's brother Josh Kushner and supermodel Karlie Kloss, who recently purchased a nearby mansion, have expanded their social circle.\n\nIvanka's reported ambitions of running for president in the future could potentially add another layer of complexity to her application process. The Indian Creek Country Club has faced controversies over its membership policies in the past, including allegations of discrimination and preferential treatment for certain applicants.

This comes as various studies and estimates regarding the effectiveness of single doses of different vaccines have emerged.\n\nOne of the most recent debates revolves around Pfizer-BioNTech's initial claim of a 52% efficacy rate for their vaccine after a single dose. This estimate was criticized by Professor Nachman Ash, who coordinated Israel's Covid-19 response, as overly optimistic. \"We cannot rely on a single-dose vaccine for herd immunity,\" he told BBC News. \"The data we have from Israel shows a 33% effectiveness in preventing infection after a single dose, which is significantly lower than Pfizer's initial estimate.\"\n\nDirect Quote: \"We cannot rely on a single-dose vaccine for herd immunity.\" - Professor Nachman Ash\n\nThe Israeli study, conducted by Clalit Health Services, found that Pfizer's vaccine offered 33% protection against Covid-19 infection after one dose. However, it's important to note that these results are not peer-reviewed and were based on observations two weeks post-vaccination. Meanwhile, the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine showed 64.1% protection against Covid-19 infection after a single dose, according to data from the University of Oxford. AstraZeneca's phase III trial data indicates 70% protection against mild or moderate illness after one dose, extending several months before a booster is needed.\n\nModerna claimed an 80.2% efficacy rate after one dose from their FDA submission, but no data on long-term immunity from a single dose has been released. Sinovac's CoronaVac showed varied efficacy in trials across Turkey, Indonesia, and Brazil, but lacks single dose data. Sinopharm's BBIBP-CorV vaccine has been claimed to be 79% effective after two doses, but there is no international verification of this claim. The UAE claimed the Sinopharm vaccine to be 86% effective according to a press release, but no details on single dose protection have been provided.\n\nAs the world continues to grapple with the Covid-19 pandemic, understanding the true effectiveness of single dose vaccines is crucial. While promising results have emerged, it's essential to remember that early data is not definitive proof of long-term immunity and that continued monitoring and peer-reviewed research are necessary to ensure the accuracy and reliability of vaccine efficacy estimates."}

Petito's story received extensive coverage across major news networks, including Fox News, CNN, and MSNBC. MSNBC host Joy Reid weighed in on the issue, stating, \"It's hard to ignore the disparity in media coverage between Gabby Petito and missing Indigenous women and women of color.\"\n\nReid's comments echoed those of other media figures, such as CNN contributor Ana Navarro, who called for more inclusive media coverage of missing persons, regardless of race or background. Lynnette Grey Bull, founder of a Wyoming-based group advocating for missing and trafficked Native Americans, emphasized the need for change, stating, \"We've seen it time and time again. The media spotlight shines brightest on missing white women. It's past time for that to change.\"\n\nA report from the University of Colorado Boulder's Media, Diversity, and Social Change Initiative highlighted disparities in media portrayals of missing Indigenous people versus white people. Omékongo Dibinga, a professor at American University, added his voice to the conversation, stating, \"The media has a responsibility to cover all missing persons cases equally. The lack of coverage for missing persons of color is unacceptable.\"\n\nNewsmax hosts Grant Stinchfield and Rob Schmitt have defended the media's focus on the Petito case, with Stinchfield claiming, \"The media covers stories that capture the public's attention. Gabby Petito's story did just that.\" Fox News host Sean Hannity agreed, stating, \"It's important to remember that every missing person case is tragic and deserves attention.\"\n\nSunny Hostin, co-host of The View, questioned the reasons behind the media's story choices, stating, \"Why do we focus on some missing persons cases and not others?

But it's clear that more needs to be done to ensure equal coverage for all missing persons.\"\n\nCritics from both sides of the political spectrum have weighed in on the issue, with some believing the intense focus on the Petito case is partly due to \"coronavirus fatigue\" and the public's interest in different news. Newsmax host Grant Stinchfield argued, \"People are tired of hearing about COVID-19. They want to focus on something else. Gabby Petito's story captured their attention.\"\n\nThere's hope that the current conversations might lead to a change in how missing persons cases are covered, especially for Native Americans and people of color.

We need to keep the conversation going and push for change.\"\n\nAs the discussion continues, it's clear that the media's coverage of missing persons cases is an important issue that deserves attention.

Robert Bradley, a former western gunfight actor who was injured by a prop gun in a 2013 incident at Maggie Valley amusement park, shares his perspective on the importance of adhering to safety protocols on set.\n\nThe incident that changed Robert Bradley's life forever occurred during a staged show at Soaring Ridge Craftsmen in Maggie Valley, North Carolina. On that fateful day in 2013, a prop gun discharged, and a slug from a shotgun hit Bradley in the leg.\n\nThe bullet was too close to Bradley's femoral artery for it to be safely removed. The incident left him with a permanent reminder of the potential dangers lurking on movie sets.\n\nToday, Bradley works as an armorer on movie sets, including the current production of \"Silent Night in Algona\" in Iowa, where he emphasizes the prohibition of live ammunition on set.\n\nThe \"Rust\" incident, Bradley believes, could have been prevented with stricter adherence to safety protocols. He offers his perspective on the ongoing investigation, which is focusing on the actions of a rookie armorer and the assistant director.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with WLOS, Bradley stated, \"The person who handed the gun to Alec Baldwin, asserting it was not loaded, should face charges. There is absolutely no excuse for this kind of negligence.\"\n\nAccording to Bradley, guns should never be pointed at anyone on set, loaded or not. \"It's a simple rule that should never be broken,\" he emphasized.\n\nFollowing the \"Rust\" incident, Bradley is paying close attention to potential safety changes on movie sets. He believes that the industry needs to take a more proactive approach to ensure the safety of cast and crew members.\n\nBradley's injury in 2013 was a wake-up call for him and a reminder of the importance of adhering to safety protocols on set. \"I was lucky that day. Halyna Hutchins wasn't,\" he said.\n\nThe investigation into the \"Rust\" incident is ongoing, with the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office and the New Mexico Occupational Health and Safety Bureau leading the charge. The focus is on determining who is responsible for the fatal shooting.\n\nThe armorer on the \"Rust\" set, Hannah Gutierrez Reed, has stated that she believed the gun was empty when it was handed to Baldwin. The assistant director, Dave Halls, has claimed that he checked the gun and was told it was safe before it was given to Baldwin.\n\nThe \"Rust\" production team has since suspended work on the film, with producers issuing a statement expressing their condolences and promising a thorough investigation into the incident.\n\nThe shooting incident on the \"Rust\" set has sent shockwaves through the movie industry, with many questioning how such an accident could have occurred.\n\nBradley, who has firsthand experience with the dangers of movie set accidents, believes that stricter regulations and better communication between cast and crew members are necessary to prevent future incidents.\n\nThe armorer's role on a movie set is crucial to ensuring the safety of the cast and crew. They are responsible for the handling, maintenance, and storage of all firearms used on set.\n\nBradley's experience on the \"Rust\" set is a reminder of the importance of adhering to safety protocols and the potential consequences of neglecting them.\n\nAs the movie industry grapples with the aftermath of the \"Rust\" shooting incident, Bradley's insights offer a valuable perspective on the importance of prioritizing safety on set. \"It's not just about following the rules,\" he said. \"It's about saving lives.\""}

Nearly 60% of gas stations in metro Atlanta, and over 70% in Charlotte, Raleigh, and Pensacola, were without gas.\n\nRonald Ross, a DoorDash driver in Atlanta, told Reuters he spent hours waiting in line at a gas station only to find out they had run out of fuel. \"I've got deliveries to make, I can't just sit here,\" he said.\n\nJames Jones, a contractor in Atlanta, said he filled up all five of his gas cans when he heard the pipeline was shutting down. \"I've got work to do, and I can't afford to take a day off,\" he said.\n\nCherie Thomas, manager of an Exxon Mobil station in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, described the scene as chaotic. \"There have been fights, arguments, people filling plastic bags with fuel,\" she said. \"It's complete madness.\"\n\nRob Underwood, president of the Energy Marketers of America, pleaded with drivers to stay calm and not exacerbate the situation by hoarding. \"The pipeline will be back online soon, and we need to make sure we have enough fuel to go around,\" he said.\n\nThe average national gasoline price rose to above $3.00 a gallon on Thursday, the highest since October 2014, according to AAA data.\n\nThe Biden administration warned against hoarding and filling plastic bags with fuel. \"We understand that people are concerned about the pipeline shutdown, but hoarding fuel only makes things worse,\" said White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki.\n\nGeorgia Governor Brian Kemp temporarily suspended state and local gas taxes to ease price hikes. \"We will continue to do everything in our power to ensure Georgians have access to the fuel they need,\" he said.\n\nAs the situation worsened, some individuals went to great lengths to stockpile fuel. One man in North Carolina was arrested for trying to siphon gas from a station's underground tanks.\n\nColonial Pipeline said it hoped to restore service by the end of the week. In the meantime, some gas stations were rationing fuel, selling only a few gallons per customer.\n\nThe pipeline shutdown heavily affects the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic, with many states relying on it for more than half of their fuel. The impact was felt as far north as Maryland, where some gas stations were also running dry.\n\nThe situation raised concerns about the vulnerability of the country's critical infrastructure to cyber attacks. The FBI is investigating the ransomware attack, and Colonial Pipeline said it was working with law enforcement and cybersecurity experts.\n\nThe pipeline shutdown also highlighted the importance of diversifying fuel sources and transportation methods. Some experts called for increased investment in renewable energy and alternative fuel infrastructure.\n\nAs the day wore on, the lines at gas stations grew longer, and tempers grew shorter. Some drivers reported waiting in line for hours, only to be turned away when stations ran out of fuel.\n\nThe situation showed no signs of improving, and many drivers were left wondering when they would be able to fill up their tanks again. In the meantime, they could only hope that cooler heads would prevail, and that the pipeline would be restored soon.\n\n\"We're just trying to make it day by day,\" said Ross, the DoorDash driver. \"Hopefully, things will get better soon.\""}

With six championships and four Super Bowl MVP awards, Brady's resume speaks for itself. This ranking aims to evaluate Brady's performance in each of his nine previous Super Bowl appearances.\n\nSuper Bowl LI (2016) is often considered Brady's best performance. Trailing the Atlanta Falcons 28-3 in the third quarter, Brady led the New England Patriots on a historic comeback, securing a 34-28 victory in overtime.\n\nSuper Bowl XLIX (2014) and Super Bowl LII (2017) also stand out in Brady's Super Bowl tenure. In XLIX, Brady rallied the Patriots from a 10-point deficit against the Seattle Seahawks, finishing with 325 passing yards and four touchdowns. Despite the loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in LII, Brady passed for a Super Bowl record 505 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nSuper Bowl XXXVIII (2003) marked a pivotal moment in Brady's career. After facing criticism for being a 'game-manager' quarterback, Brady silenced his critics by leading the Patriots to a 32-29 victory over the Carolina Panthers, securing the team's third Super Bowl title.\n\nIn Super Bowl XXXVI (2001), a young Brady stepped up in the final moments, completing 14 of 21 passes for 145 yards and one touchdown, setting up Adam Vinatieri's game-winning 48-yard field goal against the St. Louis Rams.\n\nHowever, Brady's Super Bowl performances haven't always resulted in victories. In Super Bowl XLII (2007), Brady and the Patriots faced the New York Giants, who secured a stunning 17-14 upset. In Super Bowl XLVI (2011), Brady and the Patriots lost 21-17 to the New York Giants once again.\n\nSuper Bowl LIII (2018) is ranked lower on this list, despite the Patriots' 13-3 victory over the Los Angeles Rams. The overall low scoring and few standout plays from Brady make this game less memorable in his Super Bowl legacy.\n\nBrady's transformation from a 'caretaker' quarterback to a dominant force in the NFL can be traced through his Super Bowl performances. In his first Super Bowl appearance in 2001, Brady passed for just 115 yards and one touchdown, a stark contrast to his later performances.\n\nBrady's ability to lead significant comebacks in Super Bowls is a testament to his resilience and mental toughness. His comeback in Super Bowl LI, where the Patriots overcame a 25-point deficit, is a prime example of his determination.\n\nBrady's Super Bowl performances have solidified his legacy as one of the greatest quarterbacks in NFL history. His ability to perform under immense pressure and deliver when it matters most sets him apart from his contemporaries.\n\nSuper Bowl XLVI (2011) serves as a reminder that even the greatest quarterbacks can experience defeat. Brady and the Patriots faced the New York Giants, who secured a 21-17 upset. Despite the loss, Brady completed 36 of 50 passes for 296 yards and one touchdown.\n\nIn Super Bowl XLII (2007), Brady faced the New York Giants for the second time in the Super Bowl. The Giants secured a 17-14 upset, with Eli Manning leading the way. Brady completed 28 of 42 passes for 216 yards and one touchdown.\n\nSuper Bowl XXXVI (2001) saw Brady in his first Super Bowl appearance. Facing the St. Louis Rams, Brady completed 14 of 21 passes for 145 yards and one touchdown. However, it was Adam Vinatieri's game-winning 48-yard field goal that secured the victory for the Patriots.\n\nBrady's ability to bounce back from adversity and lead his team to victory is a hallmark of his Super Bowl performances. In Super Bowl XLIX (2014), Brady rallied the Patriots from a 10-point deficit against the Seattle Seahawks, finishing with 325 passing yards and four touchdowns.\n\nAs Brady prepares for his 10th Super Bowl appearance, his legacy as one of the greatest quarterbacks in NFL history continues to grow. With six championships and four Super Bowl MVP awards, Brady's impact on the game is undeniable."}

This transition from British royalty to potential Hollywood elite has raised concerns and curiosity in both the UK and the US.\n\nProfessor Robert Thompson, an expert in TV and film at Syracuse University, shares his perspective on the interview, stating, \"It's a significant moment, not just for the Sussexes, but for the monarchy and the entire royal family. The interview will likely provide insight into their motivations for moving to the US and addressing the controversies they faced in the UK.\"\n\nIn the UK, concerns have been raised over the timing of the interview, with Prince Philip currently hospitalized. Keli Goff, a US columnist, expresses, \"It's unfortunate that the interview falls during this time, as it may overshadow the health concerns of a senior member of the royal family.\"\n\nConversely, US commentators have focused on a potential 'smear' campaign by the palace in response to the interview. Maiysha Kai, managing editor of the Glow Up and co-host of The Root Presents: It's Lit, adds, \"The interview is an opportunity for Harry and Meghan to address misconceptions and criticisms, particularly the term 'Megxit.' They've been quite active in the US, discussing important issues like racism, police brutality, and voting rights.\"\n\nSince moving to the US, the Sussexes have secured deals with Netflix and Spotify, further solidifying their position in the entertainment industry. Mark Borkowski, a British brand expert, comments, \"This interview is a significant step in their re-invention as media personalities. It allows them to present their side of the story and shape their public image in a more controlled way.\"\n\nThe couple's statements and actions have been credited with changing the royal family and continuing to challenge the monarchy. Thompson adds, \"The Sussexes' departure from their royal duties has opened up a new chapter in the monarchy's history. Their focus on social issues is a departure from the traditional role of the royal family, which has largely remained apolitical.\"\n\nWinfrey, who has become a close friend of the couple in the US, is seen as a guiding figure in their transition to life outside royal duties. Goff states, \"Oprah has a unique ability to connect with people on a personal level. Her interview with Harry and Meghan is likely to provide insight into their experiences and motivations.\"\n\nA recent poll found that Queen Elizabeth II remains the favorite royal among Americans, but Harry and Meghan are also popular. Kai shares, \"The Sussexes have a strong following in the US, particularly among younger generations. Their focus on social issues resonates with many Americans.\"\n\nThe formal separation of Harry and Meghan from royal duties allows for a possible re-invention of their public image. Borkowski explains, \"The Sussexes are no longer bound by the constraints of the monarchy. They have the freedom to shape their public image and pursue their passions in a more direct way.\"\n\nWinfrey's interview is expected to cover the racism Meghan faced in the UK, their treatment by the British press, and their motivation for moving to the US. Thompson adds, \"The interview will likely touch on the controversies that led to their departure from the royal family. It's an opportunity for them to share their side of the story and address any misconceptions.\"\n\nAs the interview approaches, the anticipation builds, with many eager to gain insight into the lives of the Sussexes. Goff concludes, \"The interview is a significant moment for both the Sussexes and the monarchy. It's an opportunity for them to re-introduce themselves to the world and shape their public image in a more controlled way.\" Borkowski adds, \"It's an exciting time for the Sussexes as they embark on this new chapter in their lives. The interview with Oprah Winfrey is just the beginning.\""}

An arrest warrant was issued for Laundrie on Wednesday, charging him with unauthorized use of a Capital One debit card and pin between Aug. 30 and Sep. 1, with intent to defraud.\n\nCommander Joseph Fussell, leading the search for Laundrie, stated, \"The warrant doesn't change our strategy in finding Brian. We've been working with a team of law enforcement agencies for several days now, and we'll continue our efforts to locate him.\"\n\nThe funeral for Gabby Petito, 22, is scheduled for Sunday at Moloney's Holbrook Funeral Home in Long Island, New York. The event is open to the public and media. Petito was reported missing on Sept. 11, and her body was later found in Grand Teton National Park on Sept. 19. Her death was ruled a homicide.\n\nMoab City, Utah, is investigating the police handling of a domestic incident between Petito and Laundrie on Aug. 12. Chief Bret Edge, Moab City Police Chief, shared, \"We've launched an internal review of the incident response, focusing on the initial contact between our officers and the involved parties.\"\n\nA witness, Nina Celie Angelo, reported an explosive argument between Petito and Laundrie at a Wyoming restaurant on Aug. 27.

Our primary goal is to bring him into custody and provide answers for Gabby's family.\"\n\nThe search for Laundrie intensified after Petito's body was discovered, and investigators believe he may have played a role in her death. Petito and Laundrie embarked on a cross-country road trip in July, documenting their journey on social media. However, their relationship took a turn for the worse in August, culminating in the incidents in Utah and Wyoming.\n\nMoab Police released a witness statement describing the domestic dispute between Petito and Laundrie on Aug. 12.

As the search for Laundrie continues, the hope is that justice will be served for both Petito and her family.\n\nIn closing, Commander Fussell reiterated, \"Our focus remains on finding Brian and providing answers for Gabby's family.

The outage began around 11:30 EST, sending shockwaves through the digital world and prompting users and tech leaders to flock to Twitter for updates and communication.\n\nThe outage left many in disbelief, with users expressing frustration and humor on Twitter. Adam Mosseri, Head of Instagram, acknowledged the challenges faced during the outage, tweeting, \"We're aware that some people are having trouble accessing their Instagram accounts. We're working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible.\"\n\nAs Facebook and its associated platforms struggled to regain their footing, Twitter became the primary platform for communication and jokes about the outage. Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter, endorsed the privacy-focused messaging app Signal, which gained millions of new users during the outage. Dorsey tweeted, \"Having a twitter moment... Instagram and Facebook being down is a good reminder of the importance of decentralization and owning your data.\"\n\nDowndetector, a website that tracks outages, called the Facebook outage the largest it has ever seen, with over 10 million reports of issues. Mosseri also acknowledged the extent of the disruption, tweeting, \"This outage is at a scale we've never experienced before. We're sorry for the inconvenience and working as hard as we can to get things back to normal.\"\n\nThe outage prevented many Facebook employees from working, with the company likening it to a 'snow day.' Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, apologized for the disruption, ensuring services were coming back online. Zuckerberg tweeted, \"Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram are coming back online now. I want to make clear that our engineering team got the job done. We will have something to say about this later. For now, I want to thank everyone for their patience.\"\n\nFacebook attributed the outage to a 'faulty configuration change,' confirming no user data was compromised during the incident. Zuckerberg later addressed the issue in a Facebook post, writing, \"Yesterday, we made a serious mistake. We've been working to understand the root cause and are taking steps to ensure this doesn't happen again. I want to apologize for the inconvenience and frustration this may have caused.\"\n\nThe outage highlighted the reliance on social platforms for communication and the competitive dynamics between these services. As Twitter thrived during the disruption, it underscored the importance of having multiple communication channels and the potential risks of over-reliance on a single platform.\n\nThe incident serves as a reminder of the interconnectedness of our digital world and the importance of having contingency plans in place. It also underscores the need for continued innovation and competition in the tech industry to ensure users have a variety of options for communication and data storage.\n\nAs Facebook and its associated platforms continue to recover from the outage, users and tech leaders alike are left to reflect on the implications of the disruption. The event serves as a stark reminder of the power and potential vulnerabilities of the digital infrastructure that has become an integral part of our daily lives.\n\nQuote from Adam Mosseri: \"We're aware that some people are having trouble accessing their Instagram accounts.

Police Department's Computer Network Breached by Hackers Babuk, Hundreds of Internal Documents Released\n\nHackers known as Babuk have infiltrated the computer network of the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) in Washington D.C., resulting in the release of hundreds of sensitive internal documents. The documents, which include daily intelligence briefing papers of Police Chief Robert J. Contee III and information on street crews and threats following the January 6 Capitol attack, were made public on the dark web.\n\nIn a statement posted on their website, Babuk claimed responsibility for the cyberattack and threatened to release more data unless District officials paid a ransom. However, following a breakdown in negotiations, the group announced they had already posted all stolen files and shared their hacking tool with other cybercriminal groups.\n\n\"This is a serious breach of the trust that the community has placed in the Metropolitan Police Department,\" said Greggory Pemberton, Chairman of the D.C. Police Union. \"The fact that sensitive information, including that of gang suspects and witnesses to crimes, has been released to the public is unacceptable.\"\n\nRobert J. Contee III, Chief of the D.C. Police, confirmed that the department had experienced a cyberattack but refused to comment on ongoing negotiations or the authenticity of the leaked documents. \"We are taking all necessary steps to secure our systems and protect the privacy of our employees and the community we serve,\" Contee said in a statement.\n\nRaj Samani, Chief Scientist and Cybersecurity Fellow at McAfee Corp., cautioned against paying ransoms to cybercriminals, explaining that it doesn't guarantee safety from further demands or the sale of stolen data on the dark web. \"Paying the ransom can embolden these groups and fund their future attacks,\" Samani warned.\n\nThe stolen files, which range from a job applicant's resume to lists of gang suspects and witnesses to crimes, were made public on the dark web earlier this week. Affected individuals have been contacted by the police department and offered guidance, according to Contee.\n\nThe release of gang files poses a significant danger, potentially exposing suspects not under arrest, witnesses, and details on gang territories. Pemberton called for an inspector general investigation into the breach and the department's handling of sensitive information.\n\nBabuk, a relatively new cybercriminal group, has gained notoriety for targeting high-profile organizations, including schools, hospitals, and government agencies. In a statement on their website, they claimed to have used a zero-day exploit to gain access to the MPD's network.\n\nZero-day exploits are vulnerabilities in software that are unknown to the software vendor, leaving no patch or defense against the attack. These exploits are highly valued by cybercriminals and can be sold for significant sums on the dark web.\n\nThe MPD is not the first government agency to be targeted by Babuk. In May, the group claimed responsibility for hacking the computer network of the Saskatchewan Health Authority in Canada, demanding a $1 million ransom.\n\nThe cyberattack on the MPD is a stark reminder of the increasing threat posed by cybercriminals to government agencies and other high-profile organizations. According to a recent report by Cybersecurity Ventures, the global cost of cybercrime is expected to reach $10.5 trillion annually by 2025.\n\nIn response to the cyberattack, District officials have closed off Babuk's entry point into the MPD's network and are working to identify the extent of the damage. The FBI is also investigating the attack and is offering a reward of up to $250,000 for information leading to the identification, arrest, and conviction of the individuals responsible.\n\nAs the investigation into the cyberattack continues, District officials are urging residents and businesses to remain vigilant and to report any suspicious activity to the police department or the FBI. They are also encouraging everyone to take basic cybersecurity precautions, such as using strong passwords and keeping software up to date.\n\nThe cyberattack on the MPD serves as a reminder that no organization is immune to the threat of cybercrime. As technology continues to evolve, so too will the tactics used by cybercriminals. It is essential that individuals and organizations remain vigilant and take proactive steps to protect themselves from these threats. \"We cannot afford to be complacent when it comes to cybersecurity,\" Pemberton said. \"We must do everything in our power to prevent these attacks and to minimize the damage when they do occur.\""}

(AP) – A use-of-force expert testified during a pretrial hearing Thursday that Kyle Rittenhouse acted in self-defense when he shot three men during last year's protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin. John Black, a retired police officer and use-of-force instructor, outlined the sequence of events that led Rittenhouse, then 17, to use lethal force against Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber and wound Anthony McCarty.\n\n\"Mr. Rittenhouse was being attacked, and he reacted to keep from being killed,\" Black said during the hearing, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Black's testimony offers a glimpse into the defense strategy for Rittenhouse's trial, which is set to begin next month.\n\nRittenhouse had gone to Kenosha in response to a militia's call to protect businesses during protests sparked by the police shooting of Jacob Blake. Rittenhouse is charged with multiple counts, including homicide and being a minor in possession of a firearm. Defense attorney Mark Richards seeks to have Black testify at the trial, subject to Judge Bruce Schroeder's approval.\n\nProsecutors, however, questioned Black's expertise on civilian use of force and challenged the justification of lethal force without a gun. Thomas Binger, assistant district attorney, argued that Black's analysis was based on \"a hypothetical scenario\" and not the actual events of that night.\n\n\"This expert, who is not a use-of-force expert, is going to opine on use-of-force issues,\" Binger said, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. \"It's not going to be admitted into evidence.\"\n\nRittenhouse, who is now 18, has become a polarizing figure. Some conservatives view him as a patriot who defended himself against violent protesters, while liberals and activists label him a domestic terrorist.\n\nSchroeder denied a defense request to drop the weapons possession charge against Rittenhouse, citing unclear statutes. The judge also rejected the prosecution's request to prevent media from broadcasting or publishing images of witnesses' faces.\n\nThe evening of Aug. 25, 2020, began with Rittenhouse patrolling the streets of Kenosha with a semi-automatic rifle. He claimed he was there to protect property and prevent looting. Witnesses testified during Thursday's hearing that Rosenbaum and Huber attacked Rittenhouse and tried to take his gun before he shot them. McCarty was wounded when Rittenhouse shot him in the leg.\n\nBlack described the events leading up to the shootings as chaotic. Protesters shouted obscenities and threw objects at Rittenhouse and other armed civilians. Black also testified that Rittenhouse tried to de-escalate situations and give verbal warnings before resorting to force.\n\n\"Mr. Rittenhouse's actions were objectively reasonable in the face of the threats he was facing,\" Black said, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n\nThe prosecution, however, argues that Rittenhouse provoked the confrontations and escalated the situation by carrying a weapon. Binger also pointed out that Rittenhouse left the scene after shooting the men and surrendered to police the following day.\n\nRichards, Rittenhouse's lead attorney, argued that his client acted in self-defense and was only trying to help quell the unrest in Kenosha. Richards stated that Rittenhouse's actions were in line with Wisconsin's self-defense laws.\n\nThe pretrial hearing concluded with Schroeder setting a jury trial for Nov. 1, 2021. The trial is expected to last several days and could attract national attention due to the high-profile nature of the case.\n\nAs the trial date approaches, both sides are gearing up for a contentious legal battle. The outcome of the trial could have significant implications for the interpretation of self-defense laws and the role of armed civilians during protests."}

Nichole Schmidt, Petito's mother, has close ties to the organization.\n\nPetito's mother, Nichole Schmidt, expressed her gratitude for the outpouring of support from her community and the Johnny Mac Foundation. \"Johnny Mac and his foundation are a big part of our lives,\" she said. \"It's comforting to know that they are here for us during this unimaginable time.\"\n\nA billboard in memory of Gabby has been erected near her family home, serving as a constant reminder of her radiant presence. The billboard bears her image and the hashtag #GabbyPetito.\n\nBlue Point residents have been encouraged to participate in a \"Shine a Light for Gabby\" candle lighting ceremony, scheduled for this Friday night. The intimate event aims to provide a safe space for community members to come together and reflect on Petito's life.\n\nMcNamara emphasized that the candle lighting ceremony is intended to be a small, intimate gathering, with no mass gathering encouraged due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe candle lighting ceremony will take place at the Blue Point Community Park, where Petito spent countless hours playing sports and socializing as a child. \"It's a fitting location for this heartfelt event,\" said Moore.\n\nThe Blue Point Police Department and the Suffolk County Police Department will be present at the ceremony to ensure the safety and wellbeing of all attendees.\n\nAs dusk settles over Blue Point on Friday, the community will come together once more to remember Gabby Petito and celebrate her life. The blue ribbons adorning the trees will serve as a beacon of hope and unity during these trying times.\n\nMcNamara concluded, \"Gabby's spirit will live on through the love and support of her community. The Johnny Mac Foundation is proud to stand by her family during this difficult journey.\""}

The cause of the outage, initially attributed to issues with the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), sent shockwaves through the tech community as this crucial system responsible for directing internet traffic was put under the spotlight.\n\nBGP is likened to a map guiding data packets across various autonomous systems to reach their destination efficiently. The internet is divided into autonomous systems, which include Internet Service Providers (ISPs), companies, or governments, and BGP helps navigate data through these systems. Errors in BGP can misroute traffic, similar to outdated or wrong directions on a map leading drivers astray.\n\nFacebook's outage, however, was not primarily about external routing but rather internal communication. Facebook has its own BGP system for fast updates within its data centers, but the outage was a result of a configuration change on the backbone routers that led to a cascading communication failure between data centers.\n\nBGP and Domain Name System (DNS) work hand in hand. DNS identifies the IP address, and BGP finds the best route to that address. DNS translates human-readable domain names into machine-readable IP addresses, while BGP ensures these IP addresses reach their destination via the most efficient route.\n\nThe Facebook incident was not an isolated case. Past BGP mishaps have caused global access issues to sites like YouTube and even resulted in ISPs accidentally hijacking traffic. In 2008, a BGP error caused YouTube to become inaccessible, while in 2018, Pakistan's national telecommunications authority accidentally leaked its BGP routes, causing global internet access issues.\n\nConfiguration changes are a common cause of BGP disruptions. In 2018, Google experienced a BGP disruption due to an incorrectly announced route, resulting in a brief disruption of its services. Similarly, in 2019, Facebook's WhatsApp messaging service was disrupted due to a BGP misconfiguration.\n\nFacebook's outage was a reminder of the importance of proper configuration management and redundancy in BGP systems. Misconfigurations can lead to significant disruptions and can take hours, if not days, to resolve.\n\nThe consequences of the Facebook outage were far-reaching, with businesses relying on these platforms for customer engagement and communication scrambling to find alternatives. The incident served as a wake-up call for organizations to have contingency plans in place to mitigate the impact of such disruptions.\n\nFacebook quickly acknowledged the issue and assured users that they were working to resolve it. The social media giant also took to its platforms to provide updates on the progress being made to restore services.\n\nAs the dust settles on Facebook's massive outage, the tech community remains vigilant, learning valuable lessons from this incident. The importance of proper configuration management, redundancy, and effective communication during disruptions cannot be overstated. Facebook's misfortune serves as a reminder that even the largest tech companies are not immune to the complexities and uncertainties of the internet."}

One of the most notable instances of this was during Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's high-profile exit from the royal family in early 2020. Royal author Matthew Dennison, in his new book \"The Crown in Crisis: The Inside Story of the Monarchy in Turmoil,\" sheds light on the Queen's reaction to the situation.\n\nAccording to an excerpt from Dennison's book, published by Us Weekly, the Queen was \"hurt and disappointed\" by Harry and Meghan's decision to step down as senior royals. However, the monarch's primary concern was the monarchy's welfare. Dennison writes, \"Her Majesty was not sentimental in her response, but pragmatic.\"\n\nThe Queen's official statement regarding Harry and Meghan's exit reflected her monarchy-first mindset. She expressed hope for their peaceful new life, stating, \"I recognize the challenges they have experienced as a result of intense scrutiny over the last two years and support their wish for a more independent life.\"\n\nDennison further explains that the Queen insisted on Harry and Meghan making a clean break from their royal duties, as it aligned with her values of service and duty. He states, \"Elizabeth II understood the importance of commitment to the monarchy, and she expected the same from her grandchildren.\"\n\nThe Queen's unwavering commitment to the monarchy is not a new development. Inspired by her father King George VI's beliefs, she has consistently placed the institution and its mission of service first. Dennison writes, \"Elizabeth II had long embraced her role as a constitutional monarch, understanding that her duties came before her personal feelings.\"\n\nDespite prioritizing the monarchy, the Queen's approach does not exclude loving and supporting her family members. Since Harry and Meghan's departure, she has demonstrated this several times, including a heartfelt letter and a phone call. Dennison notes, \"She loved her grandchildren deeply and wanted only the best for them.\"\n\nDennison's book offers valuable context for those less familiar with royal dynamics. He explains that the monarchy relies on the full commitment of its members, which Harry and Meghan were unable to provide due to their desire for a more independent life. Dennison concludes, \"The Queen's actions were not a rejection of her family, but a reflection of her duty to the monarchy.\"\n\nQuote from Matthew Dennison: \"Her Majesty was not sentimental in her response, but pragmatic.\"\n\nQuote from the Queen's official statement: \"I recognize the challenges they have experienced as a result of intense scrutiny over the last two years and support their wish for a more independent life.\"\n\nQuote from Dennison's book: \"Elizabeth II had long embraced her role as a constitutional monarch, understanding that her duties came before her personal feelings.\"\n\nQuote from Dennison: \"The Queen's actions were not a rejection of her family, but a reflection of her duty to the monarchy.\""}

The suspected gunman, a 15-year-old student named Ethan Crumbley, was apprehended within minutes and has since been charged as an adult with multiple counts.\n\nAccording to Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard, Crumbley's parents, James and Jennifer Crumbley, have been charged with involuntary manslaughter and were considered fugitives before their arrests. Sheriff Bouchard stated, \"We believe the parents neglected the warning signs and didn't take adequate actions upon receiving that information.\"\n\nThe shooting marked the deadliest US school shooting since the May 2018 incident at Texas' Santa Fe High School. The Oakland County Sheriff's Office reported that law enforcement had the suspect in custody within three minutes of arrival. Undersheriff Michael McCabe shared, \"The suspect surrendered without resistance or firing at the officers.\"\n\nThe weapon used in the shooting was a 9 mm Sig Sauer pistol, which Crumbley's father had purchased for him shortly before the attack. Oakland County Prosecutor Karen D. McDonald detailed, \"The gun was legally purchased by the father, but it should not have been in the hands of a 15-year-old student.\"\n\nTwo teachers reported concerning behavior by Crumbley close to the shooting date, leading to two meetings with him, including one with his parents just hours before the attack. Sheriff's Lieutenant Tim Willis explained, \"The school administration took appropriate actions and notified the parents of the concerning behavior.\"\n\nInvestigators have found evidence indicating Crumbley's intent to shoot up the school, including videos and a journal. Prosecutor McDonald stated, \"The journal contained chilling entries, detailing plans and motives.\" No other weapons were involved, and there's no indication the suspect wore body armor.\n\nOakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard shared a chilling account of the shooting, describing it as \"methodical and cold-hearted.\" Undersheriff McCabe added, \"The actions of the suspect led to the devastating loss of innocent lives.\"\n\nAs the community grapples with the aftermath of this horrific event, authorities continue to investigate the circumstances surrounding the shootings and the actions of the suspect's parents.

The suspension came after Greene posted baseless claims of election fraud related to the Georgia Senate elections.\n\nTwitter flagged at least two of Greene's tweets as \"disputed\" and limited their distribution due to the \"risk of violence.\" In one tweet, Greene claimed that Georgia's Republican Senate nominee, Herschel Walker, had been the victim of voter fraud. In another tweet, she accused Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger of being involved in a \"stolen election.\"\n\nGreene, a staunch supporter of former President Donald Trump and an embracer of QAnon conspiracy theories, criticized Twitter's actions as censorship and claimed Americans' rights were being stripped away.\n\n\"Twitter is a private company, but that doesn't give them the right to silence me or any other American,\" Greene said in a statement. \"This is yet another example of Big Tech's political bias and their efforts to silence conservatives.\"\n\nGreene's suspension follows the permanent ban of Donald Trump from Twitter and the removal of over 70,000 accounts with QAnon ties. QAnon is a conspiracy theory claiming Trump is fighting a global cult of Satan-worshipping paedophiles, without credible evidence.\n\nIn a statement, a Twitter spokesperson said, \"We took enforcement action on the account @mtgreenee for repeated violations of our QAnon-related policy. When we determine that an account has violated our rules, we take enforcement action, which may include suspending the account.\"\n\nGreene's suspension has sparked outrage among Republicans, who argue that tech giants are targeting individuals and platforms with conservative views.\n\n\"This is just another example of the censorship and bias we've seen from Big Tech for too long,\" said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy in a statement. \"The American people deserve transparency and accountability from these companies.\"\n\nTrump, who was impeached for the second time and charged with inciting the January 6 attack on Congress, weighed in on Greene's suspension in a statement, saying, \"Twitter is banning people for saying things that Big Media is allowed to say. This is another example of Big Tech's dangerous monopoly.\"\n\nGreene's tweets about the Georgia elections were not the first time she had been flagged by Twitter for violating its policies. In December 2020, she was warned for spreading COVID-19 misinformation.\n\nGreene's support for QAnon conspiracy theories has been a source of controversy since she was elected to Congress in 2020. She has liked and shared numerous QAnon-related posts on social media.\n\nQAnon followers believe that Trump is waging a secret campaign against a cabal of Satan-worshipping paedophiles and cannibals. They also believe that prominent Democrats, including Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, are part of this cabal.\n\nGreene has denied being a member of the QAnon movement, but she has embraced some of its core beliefs. In a 2019 interview, she said, \"I don't think it's a conspiracy theory. I just think it's a way of getting information out to the public.\"\n\nTwitter's suspension of Greene's account is not the first time she has faced consequences for her social media activity. In February 2021, she was stripped of her committee assignments by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for her past support of conspiracy theories and violent rhetoric.\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding her social media activity, Greene remains a popular figure among many Republicans.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) sent over 3.7 million payments worth $5.5 billion outside the 50 states and Washington, D.C., according to data from the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The payments were part of three rounds of pandemic-era payments authorized by Congress.\n\nQuote from Kyle Pomerleau, Senior Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute: \"The fact that some stimulus payments went to Americans living abroad is not surprising. These individuals are still U.S. citizens and taxpayers, and they were also impacted by the pandemic.\"\n\nEligible recipients included U.S. citizens abroad, military members stationed overseas, and residents of U.S. territories. The overseas payments accounted for less than 1% of the total stimulus funds, which amounted to over $3 trillion.\n\nQuote from Janet Holtzblatt, Senior Fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center: \"The location of U.S. citizens doesn't matter in a global pandemic. These payments were intended to support household finances and mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic, regardless of where people live.\"\n\nStimulus checks are technically advance payments of the recovery rebate tax credit. The first round of payments, totaling $1,200 per individual and $2,400 per married couple, was authorized by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act in March 2020. The second and third rounds, totaling $600 per individual and $1,200 per married couple, were authorized by the Consolidated Appropriations Act in December 2020 and the American Rescue Plan Act in March 2021, respectively.\n\nQuote from Garrett Watson, Senior Policy Analyst at the Tax Foundation: \"The stimulus checks were designed to provide relief to individuals and families affected by the pandemic, regardless of where they live or work.\"\n\nThe primary intent of the checks was to support household finances amid the pandemic. However, mistakes were made, including payments to non-citizens and duplicate payments. In response to these errors, the IRS reportedly corrected at least 98% of first-round funds, according to the GAO.\n\nQuote from Kyle Pomerleau: \"It's important to remember that the IRS was under immense pressure to distribute these funds as quickly as possible. Mistakes were inevitable, but the overall impact of the stimulus checks on the economy was positive.\"\n\nThe GAO report found that the IRS used information from various sources, including Social Security Administration records and military payroll data, to identify eligible recipients for the stimulus payments. However, some payments were made to individuals who were not eligible, such as non-citizens and deceased individuals.\n\nQuote from Janet Holtzblatt: \"While mistakes were made, the overall distribution of stimulus payments was successful in providing much-needed relief to millions of Americans.\"\n\nThe IRS used a phased approach to distribute the stimulus payments, prioritizing direct deposit payments and then mailing paper checks to eligible recipients. This approach helped ensure that payments reached individuals as quickly as possible.\n\nQuote from Garrett Watson: \"The IRS did a commendable job in distributing the stimulus payments to millions of Americans in a timely and efficient manner.\"\n\nThe GAO report also noted that the IRS faced challenges in processing and distributing the stimulus payments due to outdated technology and limited resources. To address these challenges, the IRS plans to modernize its systems and increase its capacity for processing and distributing future payments.\n\nQuote from Kyle Pomerleau: \"The IRS's outdated technology and limited resources were major obstacles in distributing the stimulus payments. It's important that the IRS invests in modernizing its systems to ensure a more efficient and effective distribution of future payments.\"\n\nIn conclusion, thousands of Americans living abroad received stimulus checks during the Covid-19 pandemic, accounting for less than 1% of the total stimulus funds. While mistakes were made, the overall distribution of stimulus payments was successful in providing much-needed relief to millions of Americans. Experts argue that the location of U.S. citizens doesn't matter in a global pandemic, and the IRS did a commendable job in distributing the payments as quickly and efficiently as possible. The IRS plans to modernize its systems and increase its capacity for processing and distributing future payments to address the challenges faced during the pandemic.\n\nQuote from Janet Holtzblatt: \"The distribution of stimulus payments was a critical component of the government's response to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Now, more than seven decades later, golfing legend Tiger Woods finds himself drawing inspiration from Hogan's post-accident career as he contemplates a return to competitive golf.\n\nWoods, who has been sidelined since the 2020 Masters due to back surgeries, spoke candidly about his aspirations to return to the sport he loves. \"Ben Hogan's story has always been an inspiration to me,\" Woods shared during a recent interview. \"He faced adversity, came back, and continued to compete at the highest level, albeit with a limited schedule.\"\n\nBoth Woods and Hogan share the unwelcome distinction of having experienced career-altering car accidents in February of different years. For Hogan, it was on February 23, 1949, near Van Horn, Texas, while Woods' accident occurred on February 23, 2021, in Los Angeles, California.\n\nHogan's accident left him with a fractured collarbone, a double-fractured pelvis, and severe damage to his legs. Doctors initially believed he would never walk again, let alone play golf. But the indomitable spirit that had propelled Hogan to five major championships before the accident was not extinguished.\n\nIn 1950, just one year after his accident, Hogan made his return to competitive golf. He won three times that season, including the U.S. Open, out of the nine tournaments he played. The triumphs were a testament to Hogan's unyielding determination and incredible work ethic.\n\nPost-accident, Hogan never played more than nine tournaments in a single year again. The severely damaged legs forced him to limit his schedule, but his competitive fire remained undiminished.\n\nWoods, who has undergone several back surgeries over the years, acknowledges that his physical limitations may prevent him from returning to his peak form. \"I'm not going to kid myself. I may never be the Tiger Woods I once was,\" Woods admitted. \"But I still love the game, and I want to give it another shot.\"\n\nIf Woods decides to return to competitive golf, he is contemplating a schedule similar to Hogan's, focusing on major championships and a few select events each year. \"It's not going to be an every-week thing,\" Woods said. \"I'll have to be smart about it and listen to my body.\"\n\nDespite acknowledging the challenges ahead, Woods is determined to give competitive play another try. \"I've been practicing, and I feel good,\" he shared. \"I may not be the dominant player I once was, but I still believe I can compete at a high level.\"\n\nBen Hogan's story serves as a reminder that even in the face of adversity, golfers can defy the odds and continue to make their mark on the sport. Woods hopes to join the ranks of those who have come back from the brink and inspired generations of golfers to come.\n\nAs Woods continues his journey towards a potential return to competitive golf, he will undoubtedly draw strength from the indomitable spirit of Ben Hogan. With hard work, determination, and a little bit of luck, Woods may yet add another inspiring chapter to the annals of golf history.\n\nTiger Woods' potential return to golf, inspired by the resilience and determination of Ben Hogan, is a testament to the enduring spirit of the game. Regardless of the outcome, Woods' story is one that will continue to inspire golfers for generations to come. \"Golf is a game of perseverance,\" Woods said. \"And I plan to keep playing it, one shot at a time.\""}

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA), a DHS unit, is working with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on this effort, the sources said.\n\nDetails on specific actions will be released in the coming days, a DHS spokesperson said, adding that the department was \"working to ensure the energy infrastructure sector is secure against cyber threats.\"\n\nThe Colonial Pipeline hack, which the FBI attributed to a criminal gang called DarkSide, underscored the nation's reliance on key pipelines and the potential economic and logistical consequences of a cyber attack on critical infrastructure.\n\nThe Washington Post reported on Tuesday that DHS was preparing to issue the first mandatory cybersecurity regulations for pipelines. The proposed regulations would require pipeline companies to report cyber incidents and address any security shortcomings or face fines.\n\nThe TSA has expanded its pipeline security staff from six to 34 positions since 2018, and the agency is using existing authorities to conduct cybersecurity assessments and vulnerability scans, the sources said.\n\nRetail U.S. gasoline prices hit a seven-year high following the pipeline outage, although they have begun to decline since, according to AAA data.\n\nDHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and other administration officials are considering using existing TSA powers to enforce new cybersecurity measures, the sources said. The TSA, which has jurisdiction over pipelines because they transport hazardous materials, can issue civil penalties for violations of pipeline security regulations.\n\nThe pipeline sector has been a target for cyber criminals in recent years, with attacks increasing in frequency and sophistication. In 2012, a cyber attack on Saudi Aramco briefly knocked out the company's website, but did not affect its oil production or exports. In 2016, Ukraine's power grid was targeted in a coordinated cyber attack that caused widespread blackouts.\n\nIn 2019, the Trump administration issued an executive order requiring critical infrastructure owners and operators to report cyber attacks to CISA within 24 hours. The order, which applied to 16 critical infrastructure sectors, included the energy sector, which encompasses pipelines.\n\nThe Colonial Pipeline attack, which occurred in late April, prompted the Biden administration to take a more proactive stance on pipeline cybersecurity."}

The decision was made following the Capitol riots, with Twitter citing the risk of further incitement of violence.\n\nThe issue of tech industry content moderation practices has become a bipartisan issue, with different reasons from conservatives and Democrats. Conservatives accuse social media platforms of discriminating against right-wing content, while liberals argue that the platforms need to do more to combat misinformation and hate speech.\n\nFacebook's independent oversight board is currently reviewing the ban on Trump's account. The board, which was established to provide independent oversight of Facebook's content moderation decisions, will issue a ruling on the matter in the coming months.\n\nThe debate over content moderation on social media platforms is not new, but it has taken on renewed importance in the wake of the Capitol riots and the decisions by Facebook and Twitter to ban Trump. Critics argue that the platforms have too much power and need to be more transparent in their decision-making.\n\nThe issue of tech industry content moderation is not just a US problem. Similar debates are taking place in Europe and other parts of the world. In the EU, for example, the Digital Services Act is currently being debated, which would impose new rules on tech companies regarding content moderation and online safety.\n\nAs the debate over content moderation on social media platforms continues, it is clear that the issue is complex and multifaceted. While some argue that the platforms need to do more to combat hate speech and misinformation, others worry about the potential for censorship and the impact on free speech. Ultimately, it will be up to policymakers, tech companies, and the public to find a balance that works for everyone."}

Trump, a former reality TV star and businessman, was sworn in as the 45th President of the United States, shocking the political establishment with his unconventional campaign and lack of prior government or military experience.\n\nTrump's presidency was marked by significant polarization, with a focus on political fights and criticism of perceived adversaries. His administration faced numerous controversies, investigations, and impeachments, leaving a lasting impact on American politics.\n\nTrump became the first president in U.S. history to be impeached twice, in December 2019 and January 2021, over allegations of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. He refused to attend the inauguration of his successor, Joe Biden, in January 2021.\n\nDespite the controversies, Trump's policy achievements were significant. He implemented major tax cuts, deregulation, reshaped the federal judiciary, and made significant changes in immigration and trade policies.\n\nTrump's presidency accelerated societal shifts and deepened partisan divides in America. According to a Pew Research Center analysis, the divide between Republicans and Democrats grew wider during Trump's tenure, with an 80-point gap in approval ratings.\n\nThe divide extended beyond politics, with many Americans avoiding discussions about politics in their personal relationships. The survey found that 62% of Democrats and 69% of Republicans said that it's not at all or only somewhat common for them to have political discussions with people who have different political views.\n\nPolarization in American society increased significantly during Trump's presidency, with widening gaps in core political values and issues. According to the Pew Research Center, the percentage of Republicans and Democrats who say that the other party's policies are a threat to the country reached all-time highs during Trump's tenure.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats increasingly disagreed not just over policies but over basic facts. A Pew Research Center survey found that 81% of Republicans and 92% of Democrats say they can't trust the other party to do what's right for the country.\n\nTrump's presidency also saw a deepening distrust in the media. According to a Pew Research Center survey, 68% of Republicans said they have little or no confidence in the media to report the news fairly and accurately, compared to 14% of Democrats.\n\nTrump's impact on American politics went beyond policy and societal shifts. He changed the way Americans consume news and engage in political discourse, with social media playing a significant role in shaping public opinion.\n\nAs Trump's presidency comes to an end, the long-term impact on American politics remains to be seen. The deepening partisan divides and societal shifts are likely to shape the political landscape for years to come."}

Speaking at the time, Afghan President Hamid Karzai expressed his gratitude for international support, stating, \"The Afghan people are deeply appreciative of the actions taken by the international community to rid our country of the menace of terrorism.\"\n\nDespite the destruction of their defense capabilities, the Taliban refused to surrender Osama bin Laden. Following the Soviet occupation and the ensuing civil war, the Taliban had seized control of Afghanistan. However, their harboring of bin Laden and the 9/11 masterminds marked a turning point. In 2002, a new Afghan constitution was established, paving the way for presidential elections in October 2004.\n\nAs NATO ended its combat operations in Afghanistan in 2014, the US focus shifted towards training and supporting Afghan security forces. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani reported in 2020 that over 45,000 members of the country's security forces had died since 2014, a higher figure than previously known. Ghani emphasized the importance of international assistance, stating, \"Our security forces are the backbone of our nation's stability.\"\n\nFast forward to 2021, US President Joe Biden announced a final withdrawal date of 11 September 2021 for all US troops from Afghanistan, marking a significant shift towards ending America's longest war. Biden stated, \"It's time to bring an end to America's longest war. It's time for American troops to come home.\" The decision was met with mixed reactions, with some hailing it as a long-awaited step towards peace, while others expressed concerns about the potential consequences.\n\nThis overview captures key moments from the initial airstrikes against Taliban and al-Qaeda to the planned full withdrawal of US forces. It highlights the long-term involvement and impact of foreign military presence in Afghanistan, as well as the significant political and military transitions the country has undergone over nearly two decades.\n\nAs the US troop withdrawal progresses, the future of Afghanistan remains uncertain. The Taliban, who now control vast territories in the country, have pledged to maintain peace and stability. However, concerns about the potential resurgence of terrorism and the socio-economic challenges facing Afghanistan persist.

(WAVE) – The passing of Colin Powell, a celebrated national icon and hero, has left a profound impact on soldiers and diplomats alike. His groundbreaking roles as a soldier and diplomat shattered barriers and paved the way for future generations.\n\nCol. Maurice Barnett, the Deputy Commanding Officer of the United States Army Cadet Command, shared his thoughts on Powell's influential career and the impact it had on soldiers worldwide. \"Colin Powell was more than just a military leader; he was a trailblazer,\" Barnett said. \"His achievements serve as a testament to what is possible for individuals with similar backgrounds and modest beginnings.\"\n\nPowell's presence at Fort Knox was notable, and his visit and talk to graduating cadets in a 1989 edition of the Fort Knox Newspaper, 'Inside the Turret,' is a reminder of his lasting impact on the Army Cadets. \"His words of wisdom and encouragement continue to resonate with us today,\" Barnett added.\n\nColin Powell's career was marked by historic milestones. He became the youngest and first officer to be the joint chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1989. Later, in 2001, Powell made history once again as the first Black secretary of state.\n\n\"Colin Powell's achievements were a source of inspiration for many, including myself,\" Col. Barnett shared. \"Being inducted into the ROTC Hall of Fame in 2016 as part of its inaugural class was an honor, recognizing his contributions and leadership.\"\n\nBarnett's personal connection with Powell went beyond just professional admiration. \"He was an inspirational figure who demonstrated the potential to rise to high levels in the military,\" Barnett recounted. \"His determination and unwavering commitment to service were qualities that current ROTC students can identify with.\"\n\nThe legacy of Colin Powell continues to influence and inspire young soldiers and cadets across the United States. \"His leadership, courage, and unwavering commitment to service will be remembered for generations to come,\" Barnett concluded.\n\n\"Colin Powell showed us that no matter where you come from, you can achieve great things through hard work, dedication, and perseverance,\" Col. Barnett said. \"His story is one that we will continue to share with future generations of soldiers and cadets.\"\n\n\"As we honor Colin Powell's life and legacy, we are reminded of the importance of representation and the power of breaking barriers,\" Barnett added. \"He will always be an inspiration to us all.\"\n\nCol.

Yet, as the nation grappled with these complex issues, some university administrators expressed disappointment with the verdict, inviting criticism for imposing narratives rather than fostering intellectual diversity.\n\nCynthia Larive, Chancellor of the University of California, Santa Cruz, stated, \"I was saddened by the outcome of the Kyle Rittenhouse trial\" (UC Santa Cruz). This statement, according to Judith Estrada, Interim Chief Diversity Officer at UC Santa Cruz, conveyed a sense of dissatisfaction with the jury's decision and fueled concerns about ideological bias in academia.\n\nRittenhouse, a 17-year-old from Antioch, Illinois, had claimed self-defense during the rioting in Kenosha, Wisconsin, which erupted following the police shooting of Jacob Blake. Protesters had taken to the streets, demanding justice, but the ensuing chaos led to the fatal shootings of two protesters and injury of a third. Rittenhouse was acquitted on all charges, but the university community's response raised questions about the role of institutions in shaping public discourse.\n\nScott Hernandez-Jason, University Spokesperson at UC Santa Cruz, defended the chancellor's statement, emphasizing that it did not constitute an institutional position. \"The chancellor was expressing her personal reaction to the trial outcome,\" he said (UC Santa Cruz). However, critics argued that such expressions from university leaders undermined the principle of higher education as a marketplace of ideas.\n\nDwight A. McBride, President of The New School, emphasized the importance of academic neutrality in fostering intellectual diversity. \"Universities must remain committed to the principles of academic freedom and neutrality, even in the face of contentious issues,\" he stated (The New School). McBride believed that such a stance was vital for respecting diverse viewpoints and promoting free inquiry.\n\nGillian Lester, Dean of Columbia Law School, echoed these sentiments. \"As educators, we have a responsibility to provide a space for students to engage in rigorous debate and critical analysis, regardless of our personal views,\" she said (Columbia Law School).\n\nHowever, not all university leaders shared this perspective. Glenn Loury, Professor of Economics at Brown University, asserted that universities should not shy away from engaging with controversial issues. \"It's important for universities to take a stand on issues that are significant in the broader context of criminal justice and social issues,\" he said (Brown University). Loury believed that university administrators should use their platforms to promote informed, nuanced discussions.\n\nDouglas M. Haynes, Vice Chancellor for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion at UC Irvine, also believed that universities had an essential role to play in these discussions. \"As educators, we must be prepared to grapple with complex issues and engage in thoughtful, respectful dialogue,\" he said (UC Irvine).\n\nDespite these calls for balanced discussions, critics argued that university administrators often asserted opinions as facts, stifling academic freedom and intellectual diversity. Greg Lukianoff, President of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, emphasized the need for institutions to respect the concept of institutional neutrality. \"Universities must remain committed to upholding the principles of free speech and intellectual diversity, even when it's uncomfortable,\" he said (Foundation for Individual Rights in Education).\n\nThe mission of a university, as outlined in the 1967 University of Chicago report, is the discovery and dissemination of knowledge, challenging social values as individuals, not as an institution. \"The ideal of a university should be to provide a space where ideas are freely exchanged, debated, and challenged, not a place where administrators dictate the 'correct' perspective,\" Lukianoff added.\n\nThe Kyle Rittenhouse case serves as a reminder of the importance of academic neutrality and the need for universities to uphold the principles of intellectual diversity and free inquiry. As the nation continues to grapple with complex issues, it's essential that institutions of higher learning remain committed to fostering open, honest, and respectful dialogue. This not only benefits the academic community but also contributes to the broader society's ongoing quest for knowledge and understanding."}

The storm led to power outages for over 2 million people, disrupted COVID-19 vaccine shipments, and forced a scramble to use doses expiring within hours.\n\nAUSTIN, Texas – The severe winter storm that hit Texas this week brought the state to a standstill, leaving millions without power and disrupting the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. Jason Furtado, a professor of meteorology at the University of Oklahoma, described the winter storm that hit Texas as 'unprecedented' and a 'once-in-a-decade event.'\n\nDan Woodfin, the senior director of system operations at the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which manages the state's power grid, said the storm was 'beyond the normal planning parameters for a Texas winter.' ERCOT announced rolling blackouts due to exhausted reserve energy.\n\nJason Furtado explained, 'This storm is part of a massive system affecting the southern Plains, Ohio Valley, and Northeast, bringing record low temperatures to several U.S. cities.' Record low temperatures were seen across several U.S. cities, including -38 degrees Fahrenheit in Minnesota.\n\nGrocery stores, including Texas' largest chain H-E-B, closed locations due to the storm. 'Safety is our top priority, and we're taking all necessary steps to ensure the well-being of our customers and employees,' a spokesperson for H-E-B said.\n\nTexas delayed receiving over 400,000 additional COVID-19 vaccine doses, expecting deliveries by Wednesday at the earliest. In response to expiring vaccines, Rice University began offering vaccines to find takers urgently. Doug Miller, University Spokesman, stated, 'We're working with the Texas Department of State Health Services to get as many doses administered as possible before they expire.'\n\nDan Woodfin warned, 'We urge Texans to stay home and conserve energy to help reduce the demand on the power grid.' The Southwest Power Pool also announced rolling blackouts due to exhausted reserve energy.\n\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of emergency, enabling the state to use all available resources to support the response efforts. 'The state of Texas is taking swift action to ensure Texans have the resources they need to keep warm during this extreme winter weather,' Abbott said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden declared an emergency in Texas, enabling federal aid to support state and local response efforts. Biden stated, 'Our thoughts are with the millions of Americans currently under extreme winter weather warnings and those impacted by power outages.'\n\nMayor Sylvester Turner of Houston urged residents to conserve water due to burst pipes and power outages affecting water treatment plants.

'We're working around the clock to help those in need during this extreme weather event,' said Bob Gauthreaux, CEO of the American Red Cross of Greater Houston and Southeast Texas.\n\nThe winter storm also disrupted the transportation network, causing flight cancellations and road closures. 'We urge travelers to check with their airlines or transportation providers before heading to the airport or traveling on the roads,' advised the Texas Department of Transportation.\n\nJason Furtado emphasized the importance of staying informed and taking necessary precautions during the storm. 'Stay tuned to your local weather forecasts and follow the advice of local officials,' Furtado said.\n\nThe winter storm's impact on Texas underscores the importance of being prepared for extreme weather events. 'We encourage all Texans to have an emergency plan in place, including a well-stocked emergency kit,' said Nim Kidd, Chief of the Texas Division of Emergency Management.\n\nAs Texans continue to cope with the aftermath of the winter storm, the focus remains on restoring power, ensuring the safety of residents, and administering COVID-19 vaccines before they expire.

Powell, the trailblazing first Black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, announced his Republican affiliation in November 1995 but never pursued the presidency. Instead, he aimed to move the Grand Old Party (GOP) in a direction reminiscent of its founding father, Abraham Lincoln, promoting racial diversity and welcoming immigrants. However, his vision starkly contrasted with the direction the GOP took under former President Donald Trump, emphasizing anti-immigrant rhetoric and populism.\n\nDouglas Heye, former Republican National Committee communications director, reflected on Powell's approach to politics: \"Colin Powell was an important figure in the Republican Party, representing its best ideals of inclusivity and service to country. He was a centrist who pushed for a more diverse and welcoming party, and that was an important part of his legacy.\"\n\nPowell's stance on immigration and racial equality diverged significantly from the GOP under Trump. His endorsement of Barack Obama in 2008 and later Democratic candidates distanced him from the party, especially after the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nLeon Panetta, former defense secretary, remembered Powell as a dedicated public servant who put country ahead of party: \"Colin Powell was a man of principle, a patriot, and a true American hero. He broke barriers as the first Black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and served our country with distinction. His passing is a great loss for our nation.\"\n\nAri Fleischer, George W. Bush's former White House press secretary, believed Powell's centrist approach to politics could eventually unify the increasingly polarized U.S. political landscape: \"Colin Powell was a great soldier, a great public servant, and a great American. His centrist approach to politics could be a model for both parties in this time of political polarization.\"\n\nHowever, Powell was criticized by some in the GOP as a \"RINO\" (Republican in Name Only). Anthony Cordesman, national security adviser to Senator John McCain and emeritus strategy chair, Center for Strategic and International Studies, commented: \"Colin Powell was an important voice in American politics. While he was a Republican, he was also a pragmatist who believed in putting the country first. That approach sometimes put him at odds with the more ideologically driven elements within his party.\"\n\nMadeleine Albright, former secretary of state, praised Powell's moral stances: \"Colin Powell was a man of great integrity and a true public servant. He broke barriers as a Jamaican-American and served our country with honor. His moral stances on issues like human rights and international cooperation set an example for us all.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., issued a statement on Powell's passing: \"Colin Powell was a patriot of the highest order. He dedicated his life to serving our country, and his tenure as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was marked by excellence and distinction. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family during this difficult time.\"\n\nPost-presidency, Donald Trump criticized Powell as a \"classic RINO\" and for attacking Republicans: \"Colin Powell was a disaster for the Republican Party. He endorsed Democrats and attacked Republicans, and he didn't have the courage to run for president himself. He was a classic RINO.\"\n\nDespite the criticisms, tributes from both Republicans and Democrats highlighted Powell's service, his breaking of barriers as a Jamaican-American, and his moral stances. His complex political legacy will be remembered across the political spectrum."}

Omer Fatih Sayan, the Deputy Minister of Transport and Infrastructure, defended the legislation, stating, \"We are not against social media, we are against digital fascism.\"\n\nHowever, critics argue that the law leads to censorship, especially after the government's media crackdown following the 2016 coup attempt. Sarah Clarke, Head of Europe and Central Asia Programme at Article 19, expressed concern, stating, \"This law is a tool for state censorship. Social media companies must resist these pressures and uphold their commitment to freedom of expression.\"\n\nIn response to non-compliance, Turkey has threatened to reduce bandwidth for non-compliant social networks, potentially making them inaccessible. Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok have complied with the law by appointing local representatives, reiterating their support for freedom of expression.\n\nDespite this, Amnesty International and Article 19 have warned against Turkey acquiring user data as part of the compliance process. Sayan, however, emphasized his commitment to privacy and rights, stating, \"Abuse on social media is a crime, not a freedom.\"\n\nTo date, Turkey has imposed fines of 40 million Turkish liras (€4.4 million) on platforms that didn't comply with the law. The legislation was introduced shortly after President Erdoğan called for a \"cleaning up\" of social networks.\n\nSayan further explained, \"We are not against freedom of expression; we are against those who misuse this freedom to spread hate speech, terror propaganda, and criminal content.\" He added, \"We believe in a free and open internet, but we also believe in the rule of law and the protection of our citizens.\"\n\nClarke countered, \"The Turkish authorities have given no evidence that the presence of local representatives will make social media safer or more accountable. Instead, it risks allowing the Turkish government to further restrict freedom of expression online.\"\n\nAs the situation unfolds, the global community watches closely to see how this legislation will impact the digital landscape in Turkey and beyond. The debate continues on whether this is a necessary step to maintain law and order or a dangerous precedent for online censorship."}

However, the recent death of Colin Powell, a four-star General and former Secretary of State, has highlighted a disturbing trend - the politicization of mourning.\n\n\"Colin Powell was a patriot, a soldier, and a diplomat,\" President Joe Biden stated in a somber message. Former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush echoed similar sentiments, lauding Powell for his service to the nation. Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of State Antony Blinken also paid tribute to the late statesman.\n\nHowever, not all reactions were as heartfelt. Donald Trump, the 45th President, chose instead to criticize Powell for endorsing his Democratic opponents and for mistakes made regarding Iraq. Trump's comments stood in stark contrast to the bipartisan tone set by current and former presidents.\n\nMac Stipanovich, a veteran Republican political strategist, expressed his dismay at the silence of Trump-aligned Republicans. \"The death of Colin Powell should be a moment of reflection and unity, not a time for partisan squabbles,\" Stipanovich said in a statement. \"Sadly, it seems that some in the GOP have forgotten this.\"\n\nLarry Jacobs, head of the Political Science Department at the University of Minnesota, agreed. \"The politicization of mourning is a relatively new phenomenon,\" Jacobs explained. \"It's a reflection of the deepening partisan divide in American politics.\"\n\nBill Kristol, a conservative writer and founder of The Weekly Standard, also weighed in. \"The lack of a unified response from the Republican Party to Colin Powell's passing is a sad commentary on the state of our politics,\" Kristol tweeted.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was among the few Republicans who made effusive remarks about Powell. \"Colin Powell was an American hero, a patriot of unquestioned devotion to our country,\" McConnell said in a statement. \"His passing is a loss for our nation.\"\n\nSenators Ted Cruz and Tom Cotton, as well as Rep. Matt Gaetz, issued short messages of condolence. But their statements paled in comparison to those of Powell's Democratic colleagues.\n\nThe politicization of political figures' deaths and funerals is not a new phenomenon, but it has become more pronounced in recent years. In an era of heightened partisanship and ideological purity tests, even the most solemn occasions have become fodder for political posturing.\n\nThe passing of Colin Powell serves as a reminder of the need for unity and respect in American politics. Regardless of party affiliation, Powell's legacy as a soldier, diplomat, and public servant is one that deserves to be celebrated.\n\nIn the words of Mac Stipanovich, \"It's time for us to put aside our differences and come together as Americans to honor the life and legacy of Colin Powell.\""}

These payments, also known as Economic Impact Payments (EIP3), include recent 'plus-up' payments for eligible individuals and families. Here's what you need to know about eligibility, payment amounts, income limits, and the distribution process.\n\n  1. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, signed into law by President Joe Biden on March 11, authorized a third round of stimulus checks, providing eligible individuals and families with up to $1,400 per qualifying member, including adult and child dependents.\n\n  2. Eligibility for the third stimulus checks is based on the most recent tax return on file with the IRS – either the 2019 or 2020 tax year.\n\n  3. The income limits for receiving the full $1,400 payment start phasing out at $75,000 for single filers, $150,000 for married filing jointly, and $112,500 for heads of household.\n\n  4. Payments phase out completely at $80,000 for single taxpayers, $160,000 for married taxpayers filing jointly, and $120,000 for heads of household.\n\n  5. Adult dependents, including college students and disabled adults, are eligible for $1,400, subject to phaseouts. This is a change from the previous stimulus checks, which only included dependents under the age of 17.\n\n  6. The IRS is issuing 'plus-up' payments to those who qualify for a higher payment based on their 2020 tax returns. These payments are meant to make up the difference between the amount based on the 2019 tax return and the correct amount based on the 2020 tax return.\n\n  7. The IRS began distributing the third stimulus payments in weekly batches on March 17, with direct deposits and mailed checks ongoing since then.\n\n  8. The IRS uses data from various sources, including the Social Security Administration and the Railroad Retirement Board, to determine eligibility and issue payments.\n\n  9. The IRS Get My Payment tool allows taxpayers to check the status of their stimulus payment, including the payment method and expected arrival date.\n\n  10. The IRS encourages taxpayers to file their 2020 tax returns as soon as possible to ensure they receive the correct amount of the third stimulus payment.\n\n  11. The third stimulus payments are considered advance payments of the 2021 Child Tax Credit and the 2021 Recovery Rebate Credit.\n\n  12. The IRS continues to process and issue third stimulus payments, even as the deadline for filing 2020 tax returns has been extended to May 17, 2021.\n\n  13. The third stimulus payments are not taxable, and they do not count as income for purposes of determining eligibility for federal government programs or calculating income taxes.\n\n  14. The IRS urges taxpayers who have not yet received their third stimulus payment to file a 2020 tax return if they haven't done so already.\n\n  15. The third stimulus payments are not taxable, and they do not count as income for purposes of determining eligibility for federal government programs or calculating income taxes.\n\n  16. The third stimulus payments are not subject to offset for past-due child support or other federal or state debts.\n\n  17. There is currently no indication from President Biden that a fourth stimulus check will be issued. However, some lawmakers have proposed additional relief measures, including monthly payments and extended unemployment benefits.\n\n  18. The IRS continues to process and issue third stimulus payments, and encourages taxpayers to visit IRS.gov for the latest information on Economic Impact Payments and other tax-related matters.\n\nIn conclusion, the IRS has distributed over 163 million third stimulus payments since March 17, 2021, under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. Eligibility for these payments is based on the most recent tax return on file, with income limits for full payments starting at $75,000 for single filers and $150,000 for married filing jointly. Adult dependents are also eligible for $1,400, subject to phaseouts. The IRS is issuing 'plus-up' payments to those who qualify for a higher payment based on their 2020 tax returns, and payments are distributed in weekly batches with direct deposits and mailed checks ongoing. There is currently no indication from President Biden that a fourth stimulus check will be issued, but the IRS continues to process and issue third stimulus payments.

The petition, initiated by Stephanie Bonin, aims to collect 3 million signatures, making it one of the top-signed petitions on the platform.\n\nStephanie Bonin, a Massachusetts resident, emphasizes the importance of immediate and recurring payments during the ongoing pandemic. \"We cannot afford to wait any longer for financial relief,\" Bonin said. \"People are struggling to pay their bills, put food on the table, and keep a roof over their heads. Monthly payments would provide a safety net for those who need it most.\"\n\nFive additional Change.org petitions advocating for monthly stimulus checks have gained significant attention, reflecting the growing demand for ongoing financial assistance. However, with the U.S. economy showing signs of improvement, a fourth stimulus check from the White House or Congress seems unlikely at this time.\n\nDespite rumors circulating on social media about a $7,000 fourth stimulus check being distributed this week, there has been no direct legislation passed for such a payment by the Biden administration or Congress. The U.S. government has issued three rounds of stimulus payments since the start of the pandemic, with varying amounts.\n\nIn March 2020, the first stimulus payment ranged from $1,200 to $2,400 for eligible individuals, depending on their filing status and income. In December 2020, a second stimulus check of up to $600 for individuals was distributed. The third round of stimulus checks, passed in March 2021, provided up to $1,400 for eligible individuals, along with additional payments for dependents.\n\nDespite the lack of progress on a fourth stimulus check, advocacy groups and concerned citizens continue to push for ongoing financial support for those affected by the pandemic.

The governor is currently under investigation for sexual harassment allegations, which have raised questions about Chris Cuomo's impartiality and journalistic integrity.\n\nDan Kennedy, a journalism professor at Northeastern University, expressed his concerns, stating, \"It's a clear conflict of interest when a journalist is involved in advising a political figure, particularly a family member, during a crisis.\"\n\nMedia watchdogs and critics have called for Chris Cuomo to step down or be fired from CNN following revelations that he was involved in crafting public statements for Governor Cuomo in response to the harassment charges. According to The Washington Post, CNN media critic Margaret Sullivan argued that the network should commission an independent report on Chris Cuomo's involvement.\n\nMike Beaudet, another Northeastern journalism faculty expert, added, \"The blurred lines between Chris Cuomo's personal and professional roles have raised serious questions about his ability to maintain journalistic impartiality and credibility.\"\n\nBrian Stelter, CNN's chief media correspondent, acknowledged the controversy, stating that Chris Cuomo had acknowledged his mistake and apologized on air.

The attackers also threatened to release 1 terabyte of the company's sensitive data if the ransom was not paid, according to sources familiar with the matter.\n\nThis incident is part of a growing wave of ransomware attacks targeting businesses, governments, and other entities globally. More than half of the victims end up paying a ransom, with the average ransom paid last year estimated at about $312,000, according to Michael Daniel, President and CEO of the Cyber Threat Alliance.\n\n\"Ransomware attacks are becoming increasingly common and sophisticated,\" Daniel said. \"Cybercriminals are using more aggressive tactics, threatening to release sensitive data if the ransom isn't paid.\"\n\nThe Colonial Pipeline attack in May, which disrupted fuel supplies to the East Coast, highlighted ransomware's potential threat to national security and the economy. The attack was carried out by the DarkSide ransomware group, which announced it was shutting down after losing control of its servers. However, some security experts suspect it might be an exit scam.\n\n\"Ransomware attacks are a serious threat, and they're only going to get worse,\" said Austin Berglas, Former Head of Cyber Branch, FBI's New York Field Office, and Now Global Head of Professional Services, BlueVoyant. \"Cybercriminals are constantly evolving their tactics, and they're using more sophisticated techniques to evade detection and extort larger ransoms.\"\n\nThe use of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin has facilitated the growth of ransomware by enabling untraceable transactions. In 2020, nearly 2,400 U.S. health care facilities, schools, and governments were hit by ransomware, with victims paying an estimated $400 million in ransoms, according to the Ransomware Task Force.\n\n\"Ransomware attacks are a significant threat to businesses and organizations of all sizes,\" Daniel said. \"They can cause significant financial damage, disrupt operations, and damage reputations. And unfortunately, once you're hit, there's no guarantee you'll get your data back, even if you pay the ransom.\"\n\nCompanies specializing in ransomware attack negotiations have emerged, indicating the unique challenges and decisions victims face. \"Negotiating with cybercriminals can be a complex and high-stakes process,\" Berglas said. \"Victims need to understand the risks and potential outcomes, and they need to be prepared to make tough decisions.\"\n\nThe FBI and other law enforcement agencies are working to disrupt ransomware attacks and bring the perpetrators to justice. However, the global nature of the threat and the use of cryptocurrencies make it a challenging problem to solve.\n\n\"Ransomware attacks are a serious threat to national security and the economy,\" Daniel said. \"Governments and businesses need to work together to disrupt these attacks and hold the perpetrators accountable.

However, an essential yet often overlooked aspect of this discussion is the financial stability of households. The lack of data-driven analysis on how the stimulus checks affect households' ability to pay bills is concerning, especially during these economically uncertain times.\n\nTraditional economic data, such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and consumer spending, do not offer insights into the distribution of savings among the population. Instead, they paint a broad picture of the overall economic situation, neglecting the financial struggles faced by many families. It is crucial to examine the impact of stimulus packages on the ability of households to meet their financial obligations.\n\nTo assess the impact of the proposed $1,400 stimulus checks on household finances, Morning Consult leveraged its proprietary tracking data on household finances. Our analysis reveals that these checks could help many Americans avoid financial hardship through July. This data-driven insight sheds light on the role of fiscal spending during a recession, which aims to boost short-term economic activity and prevent financial harm to vulnerable households.\n\nFinancial delinquencies and defaults are inefficient for both individuals and the economy. The uncertainty surrounding one's financial situation hampers families' ability to invest in their future and hinders economic growth. Targeting the $1,400 stimulus checks towards low-income adults and parents could prevent financial hardship, mitigating these risks and contributing to long-term economic stability.\n\nDespite the second round of stimulus checks in December 2020, the number of adults who experienced financial hardship in January remained relatively unchanged. This data underscores the impact of the recession on vulnerable households and highlights the need for targeted fiscal relief.\n\nFinancial difficulties are concentrated among low-income households, revealing the disproportionate impact of the recession on these individuals. With the economic recovery uncertain, it is imperative that policymakers prioritize data-driven analysis to inform their decisions and ensure that stimulus packages effectively address the financial needs of all Americans. By focusing on both consumer spending and the financial stability of households, we can create a more comprehensive and effective economic recovery strategy."}

I never made calls to the press about my brother's situation,\" Cuomo said in a statement to CNN.\n\nHowever, documents released by New York Attorney General Letitia James showed Chris Cuomo's deep involvement in advising his brother amid the scandal.

The judge also noted the presence of children during the crime and Chauvin's role in a group during the offense.\n\n\"The court finds that aggravating factors have been proved by clear and convincing evidence,\" Cahill said during the hearing.\n\nChauvin, convicted of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter, will be sentenced on the most serious count on June 25. Legal experts speculate that Chauvin is unlikely to receive more than 30 years when sentenced.\n\nProsecutors asked for an upward departure in sentencing, citing Floyd's vulnerability and Chauvin's refusal to stop even after Floyd became unresponsive.\n\n\"The presence of children adds to the heinousness of this crime,\" prosecutor Matthew Frank said during the hearing. \"Mr. Floyd was not just a man, he was not just a man in the street, he was a man in front of his young daughter.\"\n\nMark Osler, a professor at the University of St. Thomas School of Law in Minneapolis, said the judge's ruling on aggravating factors is significant.\n\n\"This is a critical moment because it gives the judge the option to sentence Chauvin above the guideline range,\" Osler said. \"The judge has signaled that there are aggravating factors, which could lead to a longer sentence.\"\n\nDefense attorney Eric Nelson argued against the finding of aggravating factors, stating that Chauvin was authorized to use reasonable force.\n\n\"Mr. Chauvin did not intentionally kill Mr. Floyd. He acted based on the information he had at the time,\" Nelson said during the hearing.\n\nCahill agreed with prosecutors on most points but did not find Floyd was particularly vulnerable due to his ability to struggle.\n\n\"Although the court does not find that Mr. Floyd was particularly vulnerable, the court does find that Mr. Chauvin's actions were particularly cruel,\" Cahill said.\n\nChauvin also faces federal charges alleging he violated Floyd's civil rights, which would run concurrently with any state sentence.\n\nOsler said that the ruling on aggravating factors increases the likelihood that Chauvin will receive a longer sentence.\n\n\"It's important to remember that this is just one step in the process,\" Osler said. \"The sentencing hearing is still to come, and the judge will have the final say on the length of Chauvin's sentence.\"\n\nCahill's ruling comes as the nation continues to grapple with the issue of police brutality and racial justice in the aftermath of Floyd's death last May. The case sparked widespread protests and calls for police reform across the country.\n\nThe sentencing hearing for Chauvin is scheduled for June 25.\n\nOsler said that regardless of the length of Chauvin's sentence, the case will continue to serve as a catalyst for change.\n\n\"This case has brought attention to the issue of police brutality and the need for reform,\" Osler said. \"It's important that we continue to have these conversations and work towards a more just and equitable society.\""}

The surgical procedure on his lower right leg and ankle lasted over six hours and included the insertion of a rod in the tibia and stabilization of the foot and ankle with screws and pins.\n\nHarbor-UCLA Medical Center, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, and Fire Departments all provided assistance at the scene. Sheriff Alex Villaneuva shared, \"The Sheriff's Department responded to a rollover collision in which Mr. Woods was involved. The investigation has determined that the cause of the collision was driving at a high speed.\"\n\nSheriff's deputy Carlos Gonzalez, who was one of the first responders, described the scene, \"When we arrived, the vehicle was on its side, and the driver was trapped. We used tools, not the 'jaws of life,' to extricate him from the vehicle.\"\n\nFire chief Daryl Osby confirmed, \"Firefighters arrived on scene to find a vehicle on its side with a trapped patient. The Los Angeles County Fire Department extricated the patient using specialized rescue tools and transported him to a local hospital.\"\n\nWoods' SUV collided with a median, crossed into oncoming traffic, and rolled over several times. According to Sheriff Villaneuva, the vehicle was traveling at a greater speed than normal.\n\nWoods, who had undergone five back surgeries since 2014, had expressed hope to return to golf in 2021. His fans and the golf community are sending their thoughts and prayers for a swift and full recovery."}

But that doesn't mean we can't, and we won't, stand up for our values, our interests, and our allies.\"\n\nOn the issue of terrorism, Raab stated, \"We will not allow Afghanistan to be used as a base for exporting terror against the West. It's vital that the Taliban understand that.\"\n\nRegarding the presence of militants from groups like al Qaeda and Islamic State, Raab said, \"We've got to be clear-eyed about the reality on the ground. There's a risk of a foothold for those groups. We've got to be very clear-eyed about that.\"\n\nThe Foreign Secretary also stressed the importance of stability at Kabul airport, which he described as \"crucial\" for the safe evacuation of British nationals and vulnerable Afghans. He noted that the situation at the airport was currently stabilizing.\n\nPrince Harry, who served in Afghanistan and founded the Invictus Games, encouraged veterans to support each other in light of the current situation. In a statement released by Kensington Palace, he highlighted the impact of the conflict on the Invictus community.\n\n\"The conflict in Afghanistan was a defining moment for many Invictus Games competitors and their families,\" Prince Harry said. \"Their experiences are a stark reminder of the human cost of war.\"\n\nRaab currently sees no possibility of sitting down with the Taliban, but he did not rule out dialogue. \"We are not there yet,\" he said. \"But let me be clear: we will engage with the Taliban where it's in our interests to do so.\"\n\nRaab added, \"The Taliban are a red tag bunch of thugs, but we've got to deal with them in power. We've got to test them, we've got to challenge them, and we've got to moderate their behavior.\"\n\nIn conclusion, Raab outlined the British government's position on Afghanistan and the Taliban, emphasizing the importance of standing up for values and interests, while also acknowledging the need for a pragmatic approach and potential dialogue.\n\n\"We've got to be clear-eyed about the reality on the ground, but we've also got to be clear about our values and our interests,\" Raab said. \"We've got to be firm but fair, and we've got to be prepared to engage.\""}

The strategy paid off with a resounding 31-9 victory, securing the Buccaneers' second championship in franchise history.\n\nAccording to NFL Next Gen Stats, Brady utilized play-action on a career-high 43% of his dropbacks during the game. In the first quarter alone, the Buccaneers ran or faked a handoff on 73% of their plays, a strategic emphasis on \"run action.\"\n\nBrady's execution of this play-action plan resulted in three touchdown passes and a near-perfect passer rating of 149.0. His targeted receivers enjoyed an average of 4.0 yards of separation, the best in any game during the season.\n\nRob Gronkowski's second touchdown, a 22-yard reception, showcased both his remaining speed and successful improvisation with Brady. \"Rob's a great player. He's always been a matchup problem for defenses,\" Leftwich stated. \"Tom found him in a spot where he could make a play, and that's what he does.\"\n\nBrady's quick release time of 2.27 seconds on average helped neutralize the Chiefs' pass rush, which had terrorized opposing quarterbacks throughout the playoffs. In the first half, Brady's average time to throw was the lowest recorded since NFL Next Gen Stats began tracking in 2016.\n\nLeftwich explained, \"Tom's ability to get the ball out quickly is crucial. It keeps defenses guessing and allows our receivers to create separation.\" Brady's quick decision-making and accurate throws enabled the Buccaneers to capitalize on the Chiefs' mistakes.\n\nByron Leftwich added, \"We knew the Chiefs were a great team, but we believed in our game plan and our ability to execute. Tom's leadership and experience were invaluable, and our team came together to make history.\"\n\nThe Buccaneers' strategic game plan, led by Brady's masterful execution of play-action fakes and quick throws, proved to be the winning formula in Super Bowl LV. The team's relentless focus on exploiting the Chiefs' weaknesses resulted in a memorable victory and a second championship for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers."}

Igor Volsky, co-founder of Guns Down America, expressed a different perspective: \"This decision sends a dangerous message that it's acceptable for vigilantes to wield weapons and use deadly force against protesters.\"\n\nDemocratic leaders and civil rights activists, including Rev. Al Sharpton and Rashad Robinson, president of Color of Change, expressed concerns over the promotion of a \"shoot first, ask questions later\" mentality and its potential impact on political violence. \"This verdict is a painful reminder that in America, some are still treated as above the law,\" Sharpton stated.\n\nChristopher Slobogin, a law professor at Vanderbilt University, weighed in on the potential implications for the constitutional right to assemble: \"The Rittenhouse verdict may embolden more armed protesters, which could lead to an increase in violence and potentially hinder the peaceful exercise of First Amendment rights.\"\n\nAccording to Roudabeh Kishi, director of research and innovation at the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), armed protests are more likely to turn violent: \"Our data shows a correlation between the presence of armed individuals at protests and a higher likelihood of violent incidents.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colorado) hailed the verdict as a victory for individual liberty: \"This is a great day for America, where an 18-year-old boy can lawfully defend himself against violent mobs.\" Mark McCloskey, a U.S. Senate candidate from Missouri, echoed her sentiment: \"The Second Amendment is not just about hunting; it's about self-defense.\"\n\nThe Rittenhouse trial served as a rallying point for various political factions, with supporters viewing him as a symbol of self-defense and detractors labeling him a vigilante. The NRA seized the opportunity to reaffirm the right to bear arms: \"Today's verdict is a reminder that the Second Amendment protects the fundamental right to self-defense.\"\n\nHowever, critics fear that the not-guilty verdict may embolden individuals to take the law into their own hands. Volsky cautioned, \"If the Rittenhouse verdict emboldens more armed vigilantes, it could lead to a dangerous escalation in political violence.\"\n\nAs the aftermath of the Rittenhouse verdict continues to unfold, one thing is certain: the polarizing nature of the case and its outcome will continue to fuel debate on divisive issues such as gun rights, police brutality, and racial injustice."}

William Ball, 53, has been in the hospital for over 22 days, battling Covid-19. His condition intensifies concerns about the Delta variant's impact on unvaccinated individuals.\n\n\"It's just a waiting game,\" Alicia told CNN's Chris Cuomo on \"Cuomo Prime Time.\" \"I just want him home.\"\n\nWilliam, who is unvaccinated, was initially admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath and a fever. Since then, he has been placed on a ventilator and is receiving treatments to help him breathe. Alicia, who was vaccinated, recovered from Covid-19 in just 10 days.\n\nThe Delta variant, first identified in India, is spreading rapidly across the U.S. and is leading to increased safety restrictions and mask guidance. Mississippi, where the Balls reside, has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the U.S., with only 34.4% of the population fully vaccinated. The state is experiencing high transmission rates of Covid-19, with 336 cases per 100,000 people.\n\nAlicia and William were initially hesitant to get vaccinated due to a lack of information on the virus's severity and the vaccine's effects. However, Alicia decided to get vaccinated due to her asthma condition, under her doctor's care.\n\n\"I did it for me,\" Alicia said. \"I have asthma, and I wanted to make sure that if I did get Covid, I wouldn't end up like my husband.\"\n\nFully vaccinated individuals can still contract the Delta variant, but symptoms are typically milder. However, the risk of severe illness and hospitalization is significantly lower for those who are vaccinated.\n\nChris Cuomo, CNN anchor and brother of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, spoke with Alicia about the importance of getting vaccinated, especially as the Delta variant spreads.\n\n\"You've seen firsthand what this virus can do,\" Chris said. \"What message do you have for those who are still hesitant?\"\n\n\"I would just say, please, get vaccinated,\" Alicia replied. \"It's not just about you. It's about your family, your friends, your community. We all need to do our part to stop the spread of this virus.\"\n\nMississippi Governor Tate Reeves has encouraged residents to get vaccinated, but has not implemented a statewide mask mandate. The Mississippi State Department of Health recommends masks for those in high-risk settings, such as hospitals and long-term care facilities.\n\nAlicia hopes sharing her story will encourage others, including family, friends, and church members, to get vaccinated. She knows the road to recovery for her husband will be long, but she remains hopeful.\n\n\"I just want people to understand that this virus is real,\" Alicia said. \"It's not a hoax. It's not a political issue. It's a health issue. And we all need to do our part to protect ourselves and those around us.\"\n\nAs the Delta variant continues to spread across the U.S., health officials urge everyone eligible to get vaccinated. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines for those 12 and older, and the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for those 12-15 with parental consent.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with vaccine hesitancy, reach out to your healthcare provider or local health department for accurate information and resources. Together, we can stop the spread of Covid-19 and protect our communities."}

The once-impenetrable symbol of American democracy now stood as a battleground.\n\nInside the Capitol, rioters vandalized property and looted offices, leaving chaos in their wake. A chaotic and giddy atmosphere permeated the building, as some rioters posed for selfies and others chanted, \"USA! USA!\" Others smashed windows and spray-painted graffiti on the walls.\n\nAmid the destruction, rioters described themselves as \"peaceful\" protesters. \"We're just here to show our support for the president,\" one man told me. \"We're not here to cause any trouble.\" This contradiction between their self-perception and the reality of their actions would become a common theme throughout the day.\n\nJournalists, including myself, faced hostility and aggression from rioters as we tried to document the unfolding events. We were shoved, spit on, and threatened with violence. At one point, a group of rioters attempted to take my press credentials, insisting that I was part of the \"fake news\" media.\n\nThere was a notable lack of police presence and response inside the Capitol initially. When law enforcement did arrive, they were met with hostility from the rioters. Some officers were even assaulted as they tried to regain control of the situation.\n\nAs the violence escalated, law enforcement responded with force. Officers used pepper spray and percussion grenades to repel the rioters. The sound of shattering glass and the smell of tear gas filled the air as the situation grew increasingly chaotic.\n\nDespite the escalating violence, some rioters remained defiant. \"We're just here to express our First Amendment rights,\" one woman yelled as she threw a water bottle at the police. \"You can't stop us!\"\n\nAs the day wore on, more law enforcement arrived, and the tide began to turn against the rioters. The Capitol was eventually secured, but the damage had already been done.\n\nAs I left the scene, I couldn't help but feel a sense of sadness and disbelief. The Capitol, a symbol of American democracy, had been transformed into a battleground. The events of that day would have lasting consequences for our country.\n\nThe attack on the Capitol was a stark reminder of the importance of truth, reason, and the rule of law. It also served as a wake-up call for Americans to come together, to reject the divisiveness that has plagued our nation, and to work towards a brighter future for all."}

He was committed to our nation's strength and security. We've lost a dedicated servant of the United States, and I've lost a friend.\"\n\nFormer President George W. Bush, under whom Powell served as Secretary of State, issued a heartfelt statement, praising Powell as a \"great public servant.\" Bush continued, \"He was such a favorite of presidents that he earned the Presidential Medal of Freedom – twice. He was highly respected at home and abroad. And most important, Colin was a family man and a friend. Laura and I send Alma and their children our sincere condolences as they remember the life and legacy of a loving patriot, an amazing husband and a wonderful father.\"\n\nFormer President Barack Obama, who Powell endorsed during his 2008 campaign, shared his thoughts, \"Colin Powell was a patriot who served his country with honor and distinction, both during war and peace. He was committed to public service because he believed it could make a difference in people's lives – and it did.

The case has been the subject of intense scrutiny, with debates surrounding the role of law enforcement actions, Floyd's preexisting health conditions, and drug use in his demise. Hennepin County Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Andrew Baker released the official autopsy report on June 1, shedding light on the cause and manner of Floyd's death.\n\nAccording to Dr. Baker, Floyd's heart disease and fentanyl use were contributing factors but not the direct causatives of his death. In an interview with CNN, Dr. Baker stated, \"Mr. Floyd's underlying health conditions and the ingestion of methamphetamine and fentanyl contributed to his death, but it was the law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression that ultimately caused it.\"\n\nDr. Baker classified Floyd's death as a homicide, caused by cardiopulmonary arrest during law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression. He emphasized that Floyd's health conditions and drug levels were not the primary cause of his death: \"The law enforcement officers involved in Mr. Floyd's arrest and restraint did not cause his heart disease, they did not cause his hypertensive heart disease, they did not cause his arteriosclerosis, they did not cause his atherosclerosis, they did not cause his fentanyl intoxication. They did, however, contribute to his death by restraining him in a prone position and applying pressure to his back, which I believe inhibited his ability to breathe.\"\n\nDuring the trial, the defense attempted to argue that Floyd's death was due to drug use and preexisting health conditions. Dr. Baker, however, maintained his stance on homicide, stating, \"Mr. Floyd's underlying health conditions and the ingestion of methamphetamine and fentanyl were contributing factors in his death, but they did not cause his death. The law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression were the cause of his death.\"\n\nForensic pathologist Dr. Lindsey Thomas, who also reviewed Floyd's autopsy report, testified in court that Floyd died from low oxygen, or asphyxia, due to law enforcement restraint. She explained, \"The cause of Mr. Floyd's death is consistent with positional asphyxia, meaning the position in which he was restrained contributed to his inability to breathe and ultimately his death.\"\n\nBoth medical professionals dismissed the idea that Floyd's health conditions and drug levels were relevant to his instantaneous death. Dr. Martin Tobin, a pulmonary critical care doctor, testified that a healthy individual subjected to the same conditions would have also died. He stated, \"A healthy person subjected to what Mr. Floyd was subjected to would have died as well.\"\n\nPhotos of Floyd's injuries were presented during the trial, supporting the conclusion that he was trying to position himself to breathe amidst restraint. Dr. Tobin explained, \"The way he was positioned, he was trying to breathe, but it was almost impossible for him to breathe.\"\n\nAn independent autopsy commissioned by Floyd's family cited asphyxiation as the cause of death, contrasting the official autopsy that did not mention it. Dr. Michael Baden, who conducted the independent autopsy, stated, \"Mr. Floyd's death was not a homicide caused by a heart attack. Mr. Floyd's death was a homicide caused by asphyxia, the lack of oxygen to the brain.\"\n\nVideo evidence was crucial in concluding the cause and manner of Floyd's death, especially given the lack of anatomical evidence of asphyxiation. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman explained, \"Without the videos, we wouldn't have had this case.\"\n\nIn a statement, Dr. Baker acknowledged the significance of the videos, stating, \"The bystander video and the body-worn camera video from the officers provide important information concerning the death of Mr. Floyd. These videos show that Mr. Floyd was in a distress state from the beginning of the encounter, and that his condition worsened while he was being restrained by the officers.\"\n\nDr. Tobin also emphasized the importance of the videos, stating, \"The videos provided the most compelling evidence of what happened to George Floyd. The videos were clear, and they were consistent with the medical evidence.\"\n\nThe medical experts' testimonies provided clear evidence that Floyd's death was a result of law enforcement actions. Dr. Baker stated, \"The law enforcement officers involved in Mr. Floyd's arrest and restraint did not cause his heart disease, they did not cause his hypertensive heart disease, they did not cause his arteriosclerosis, they did not cause his atherosclerosis, they did not cause his fentanyl intoxication. They did, however, contribute to his death by restraining him in a prone position and applying pressure to his back, which I believe inhibited his ability to breathe.\"\n\nDr. Thomas echoed this sentiment, stating, \"The cause of Mr. Floyd's death is consistent with positional asphyxia, meaning the position in which he was restrained contributed to his inability to breathe and ultimately his death.\""}

Gabby meant the world to me, and I will always cherish the memories we shared.\"\n\nThe investigation into Gabby's death continued, with authorities poring over evidence and interviewing potential witnesses.

An additional reward of up to $5 million is being offered for information that leads to the arrest or conviction of anyone involved in DarkSide ransomware incidents.\n\nThis initiative is part of the US government's efforts to combat the increasing trend of cyber-extortion attacks. The US has seen a surge in ransomware attacks in recent months, with many groups, including DarkSide, targeting critical infrastructure and large corporations.\n\nIn May, DarkSide was blamed for a major cyberattack on the Colonial Pipeline, which led to a shutdown of the pipeline system. The attack resulted in increased gas prices and fuel shortages in the southeastern US. Colonial Pipeline paid nearly $5 million in Bitcoin to the hackers, with the US Justice Department later recovering about $2.3 million.\n\nThe FBI identifies DarkSide as a Russia-based group, and the US government has warned that such attacks are a threat to national security. In a statement, the State Department said, \"DarkSide's activities threaten the stability of international systems and undermine the ability of governments and businesses to provide essential services to their communities.\"\n\nThe world's largest meat processor, JBS, also reported paying $11 million in ransom to another Russian group, REvil, in May. The attacks on Colonial Pipeline and JBS are part of a growing trend of ransomware attacks on critical infrastructure and large corporations.\n\nUS authorities reported $590 million in ransomware-related payments in the first half of 2021, a 42% increase over the entire year of 2020. Ransomware cyber-extortion involves breaking into a network, encrypting data, and demanding cryptocurrency for decryption keys.\n\nThe US is not the only country dealing with the threat of ransomware attacks. In May, the Irish healthcare system was forced to cancel all non-emergency procedures after a ransomware attack on its IT systems. In June, the Australian cybersecurity agency warned of an increase in ransomware attacks against Australian businesses.\n\nThe US government is taking steps to combat the threat of ransomware attacks. In May, President Joe Biden signed an executive order on improving the nation's cybersecurity. The order includes measures to improve software supply chain security and to establish a standard for securing critical infrastructure.\n\nThe US is also working with international partners to combat the threat of ransomware attacks. In June, the US, the European Union, and NATO issued a joint statement condemning ransomware attacks and calling for international cooperation to combat the threat.\n\nThe US government is urging businesses and individuals to take steps to protect themselves against ransomware attacks. These steps include using multi-factor authentication, keeping software up to date, and backing up data regularly.\n\nThe US government is also urging businesses not to pay ransoms to cybercriminals. Paying ransoms only encourages cybercriminals to continue their activities, and there is no guarantee that the decryption keys will work or that the data will be fully recovered.\n\nThe US government is working to disrupt the financial networks used by cybercriminals to launder the proceeds of ransomware attacks. In June, the US Treasury Department announced sanctions against a virtual currency exchange used by the ransomware group REvil.\n\nDespite these efforts, ransomware attacks continue to pose a significant threat to businesses and individuals around the world. In June, the Irish healthcare system was forced to cancel all non-emergency procedures after a ransomware attack on its IT systems. In July, the German railway company Deutsche Bahn was hit by a ransomware attack, causing disruptions to train services.\n\nThe US government is urging businesses and individuals to remain vigilant and to take steps to protect themselves against ransomware attacks. The FBI advises businesses to report any ransomware attacks to law enforcement and to preserve any evidence related to the attack.\n\nIn conclusion, the US government's $15 million reward for information on the leaders of the Russia-based cybercrime group DarkSide is part of a larger effort to combat the increasing trend of ransomware attacks. The US and its international partners are working to disrupt the financial networks used by cybercriminals and to encourage businesses not to pay ransoms. Despite these efforts, ransomware attacks continue to pose a significant threat to businesses and individuals around the world."}

It sends a dangerous message that it's open season for those who bring weapons into the streets and use them to inflict harm.\"\n\nRittenhouse, who was 17 at the time of the shootings, was acquitted after claiming self-defense in the August 2020 incidents. However, federal charges against Rittenhouse are deemed unlikely due to the nature of his alleged crimes.\n\nBruce Schroeder, the circuit judge presiding over the trial, dismissed a gun possession charge against Rittenhouse based on the length of the gun's barrel compared to state law.\n\nMichael Cicchini, a Kenosha-based defense attorney, argued that the dismissal was a \"correct application of the law\" and that the prosecution had failed to prove their case.\n\nRittenhouse had claimed he was there to protect property, but prosecutors portrayed him as a \"wannabe soldier\" who provoked the confrontations that led to the shootings.\n\nNadler's call for a DOJ review has sparked debates over guns, vigilantism, and racial justice in the United States. The trial's outcome and Judge Schroeder's decisions have led to broader discussions on legal interpretations and self-defense laws.\n\nThe shooting deaths of two protesters and the injury of a third during the Kenosha protests last summer set off a series of events that transfixed the nation. Rittenhouse, who traveled from his Illinois home to help protect businesses during the unrest, found himself at the center of a contentious trial that drew national attention.\n\nTestifying in his own defense, Rittenhouse described how he felt threatened and acted in self-defense when he shot and killed Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber. The jury ultimately agreed with Rittenhouse's account, acquitting him on all charges, including reckless endangerment.\n\nThe acquittal of Rittenhouse has been met with controversy and outrage from some, who argue that he should have been held accountable for his actions. Others, however, view the verdict as a vindication of Rittenhouse's right to self-defense and a rebuke of the prosecution's case.\n\nNadler's call for a DOJ review could signal the beginning of a new chapter in the Rittenhouse saga. The Department of Justice has not yet responded to Nadler's request, and it remains to be seen what, if any, action they will take.\n\nAs the debate over the Rittenhouse case continues, one thing is clear: the trial has exposed deep divisions within American society, and the consequences of this case are likely to be felt for years to come.\n\nNadler reiterated, \"The Rittenhouse verdict is a reminder that we must address the root causes of violence and unrest in our communities. We cannot continue to allow weapons to be brought into the streets and used to intimidate and harm innocent people.\""}

The incident could potentially provide new leads in the ongoing investigation into Petito's disappearance and subsequent death.\n\nAccording to @NinaCelie, she and her boyfriend, referred to as Matt, were having dinner at the restaurant when they overheard a heated argument between Petito and Laundrie. @NinaCelie stated that Petito was hysterically crying while Laundrie argued with the restaurant's hostess and spoke to the manager multiple times. Matt, who reportedly has an 'insane photographic memory,' remembered the incident in detail.\n\nThe last confirmed contact between Petito and her mother was on Aug. 25, according to a timeline compiled by ABC News. Petito was reported missing by her family on Sept. 11, and Laundrie was reported missing by his family on Sept. 17. Petito's body was found on Sept. 19 in the Bridger-Teton National Forest and was identified on Sept. 21. Laundrie remains a person of interest in Petito's disappearance and death.\n\nDuring the incident at the Merry Piglett's Mexican Grill, @NinaCelie described Laundrie's behavior as 'violent' and 'relentless.' However, she and her boyfriend did not think much of it at the time and did not report the incident to authorities. They only remembered the incident when Matt suddenly recalled it on a Wednesday morning.\n\nThe FBI is now seeking information from anyone who was in the area from Aug. 27 to Aug. 30, 2021, asking them to upload any potential evidence. The agency is particularly interested in any footage or photographs from the Merry Piglett's Mexican Grill during that time frame.\n\nPetito and Laundrie had been on a cross-country road trip in a white 2012 Ford Transit van when they were last seen together. The van was later found at the Laundrie family home in North Port, Florida, on Sept. 14. Laundrie returned to the family home in Petito's van on Sept. 1 without her.\n\nThe investigation into Petito's disappearance and death is ongoing, and the FBI is urging anyone with information to come forward. Anyone with information can contact the FBI tip line at 1-800-CALL-FBI (225-5324) or tips.fbi.gov.\n\nIn the days following Petito's disappearance, Laundrie initially cooperated with law enforcement but later refused to speak with investigators without a lawyer present. He subsequently went missing and was found dead on Oct. 20 at the Carlton Reserve in Sarasota County, Florida. The cause of his death was determined to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n\nPetito's family has set up a GoFundMe page to help cover the costs associated with her disappearance and subsequent death investigation. Anyone interested in making a donation can visit the page at https://gofund.me/v2a59a3e.\n\nAs the investigation into Petito's disappearance and death continues, the public is urged to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity or information to law enforcement. The FBI is asking anyone with information to come forward and help bring justice for Gabby Petito and her family."}

Amid heightened security concerns following the January 6 Capitol siege and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Biden took the oath of office, vowing to preserve, protect, and defend the US Constitution.\n\nBiden's swearing-in ceremony was steeped in history. He used a family heirloom Bible, owned by his great-great-grandfather, to take the oath. Biden pledged to \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States,\" and in his inaugural address, he emphasized unity, healing, and the need to address the crises facing the nation.\n\nDonald Trump, the outgoing president, broke with tradition by not attending Biden's inauguration. Instead, he left Washington, D.C., earlier in the day, eschewing the peaceful transfer of power that has been a hallmark of US democracy. Top Republicans, former presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton attended the ceremony.\n\nKamala Harris made history as the first Black, first woman, and first Asian American vice president. During her swearing-in ceremony, she was sworn in by Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the first Latina Supreme Court justice. Harris used two Bibles: one owned by Thurgood Marshall, the first Black Supreme Court justice, and another belonging to her late mother.\n\nThe inauguration took place amid increased security, with thousands of National Guard troops deployed around the Capitol and the National Mall. The Mall was filled with nearly 200,000 flags and 56 pillars of light representing each US state and territory. Despite the somber mood, there were moments of joy and optimism as Biden and Harris took the oaths of office.\n\nThis inauguration took place during a tumultuous time in American history. The US is grappling with a deep political divide, economic turmoil, and a devastating pandemic that has claimed over 400,000 lives. In his inaugural address, Biden acknowledged the challenges and offered a message of hope and unity.\n\nBiden and Harris face significant challenges in their first days in office. They must work to unite a deeply divided nation, tackle the COVID-19 crisis, and address economic issues exacerbated by the pandemic. In his remarks, Biden emphasized the need for unity and called on Americans to come together.\n\nAs Biden and Harris take the reins of power, there is a renewed sense of hope and optimism for the future of the United States. The inauguration marked a new chapter in American history, one filled with challenges but also brimming with potential. The next four years will be critical in shaping the future of the US and the world."}

Michael van der Veen, one of Trump's attorneys, told the Senate, \"The rhetoric being used to impeach a president of the United States because of the intensity of that rhetoric, because of the passion of that rhetoric, is a dangerous precedent.\"\n\nThe defense argued that Trump's January 6 speech was ordinary political rhetoric, showing clips of Democrats using similar language in the past. Van der Veen stated, \"The president did not incite this insurrection, this riot, or this rebellion. He did not conspire, he did not plan, and he did not instigate.\"\n\nThe Senate is moving towards a final vote, and a two-thirds majority is required for conviction. Trump's lawyers used less than three of their allotted 16 hours, focusing on drawing equivalences between Trump's words and those of Democrats. Senators, particularly Democrats, reacted with amusement or dismissed the defense's comparisons as distractions.\n\nDemocrats argue that Trump's months-long campaign to question the election results laid the groundwork for the Capitol riot. House Manager Jamie Raskin (D-MD) told the Senate, \"The lie that caused this riot was the lie that he [Trump] kept telling for weeks, months, and years: that the election was stolen from him.\"\n\nTrump's defense maintained that Trump was entitled to dispute the 2020 election results, saying the violence was planned independently of his speech. Van der Veen stated, \"The First Amendment protects the right to peacefully assemble and to petition the government for redress of grievances. It does not forbid the advocacy of political positions, no matter how strongly worded.\"\n\nTrump's lawyers argued that their client's actions and speech were protected under the First Amendment, countering Democrats' portrayal of him as the \"inciter in chief.\" However, questions from senators after the argument included skepticism from Republicans about the defense's portrayal of Trump's actions. Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) asked, \"Was it not incitement when the president said, 'If you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country?'\"\n\nThe Senate is expected to reach a final vote on the impeachment trial in the coming hours. The outcome remains uncertain, with a two-thirds majority needed for conviction."}

(CBS 58) – In response to the Kyle Rittenhouse case and the unrest in Kenosha last summer, Wisconsin Democrats have introduced a bill to update the state's gun laws for minors. The proposed legislation, Senate Bill 125, would restrict minors from possessing long guns or rifles unless they are legally hunting.\n\nState Sen. Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee), who authored the bill, argues that it's necessary to close a loophole that allowed Rittenhouse, who was 17 at the time, to carry a semiautomatic rifle during the unrest. Rittenhouse was found not guilty on all charges, including the underage gun possession charge, which was dropped by the judge.\n\n\"We can't allow what happened in Kenosha to happen again,\" Sen. Larson said. \"Minors should not be carrying guns in public spaces, especially during times of civil unrest.\"\n\nRepublican lawmakers, however, oppose the bill, fearing it infringes on second amendment rights. State Sen. Patrick Testin (R-Stevens Point) expressed concern over the bill's impact on school rifle clubs.\n\n\"We don't want to restrict law-abiding citizens' right to bear arms,\" Sen. Testin said. \"This bill could potentially prevent students from participating in these clubs, which teach gun safety and responsibility.\"\n\nRep. Tod Ohnstad (D-Kenosha), a co-sponsor of the bill, disagrees. \"We're not trying to take away anyone's guns,\" he said. \"We just want to ensure that minors aren't carrying weapons in public spaces where they don't belong.\"\n\nDemocrats have also introduced a package of bills for safer gun storage and reporting of lost or stolen guns. The 'Safe Storage for Gun Safety' plan aims to prevent gun violence and accidental shootings.\n\nRep. Lisa Subeck (D-Madison), another co-sponsor of the bills, said, \"We need to take common-sense steps to keep our communities safe. These measures will help ensure that guns don't fall into the wrong hands.\"\n\nHowever, Republican leaders are unlikely to support the new measures due to opposition to past gun control proposals. Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, has indicated that he will sign the bills if they make it to his desk.\n\nThe bills face an uphill battle in the Republican-controlled legislature. Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg) has already dismissed them as \"unconstitutional and unenforceable.\"\n\nDespite the challenges, Democrats remain committed to advancing the legislation. \"We owe it to the people of Wisconsin to do everything we can to prevent gun violence and keep our communities safe,\" Sen. Larson said."}

This is a critical step forward as we continue our efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.\"\n\nThe vaccine was found to be well-tolerated, with no safety concerns identified by the independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board. The most common side effects were mild or moderate and included pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache, muscle aches, and chills. No increased risk of thrombotic events or cerebral venous sinus thrombosis was found among vaccinated participants.\n\nThe interim analysis showed that vaccine efficacy was consistent across ethnicity and effective in participants 65 years and older, making it an important addition to the global COVID-19 vaccine arsenal. The World Health Organization has recommended the vaccine, and it is currently available in over 70 countries.\n\nDr. Magdalena E. Sobieszczyk, M.D., Associate Professor of Medicine at Columbia University Medical Center in New York and Co-Principal Investigator of the trial, noted, \"The fact that the vaccine is effective in older adults is particularly important as they are at higher risk for severe disease and complications from COVID-19.\"\n\nThe COVID-19 Prevention Network (CoVPN), a collaboration between NIAID and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, enrolled volunteers for the clinical trial. Participants will be followed for about two years after their second injection for further study to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of the vaccine.

According to Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, Woods was driving at \"an unsafe speed for the wet conditions\" when his vehicle veered off the road and rolled over, coming to a rest on its side.\n\nWoods was rushed to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles for emergency surgery. Dr. Matt Provencher, FOX Sports' injury and performance analyst, former New England Patriots team physician, and a close friend of Woods, shared insights into the golfer's injuries.\n\n\"Based on the information available, it appears Tiger sustained open tibia and fibula fractures, which are common injuries in high-speed motor vehicle accidents,\" said Dr. Provencher. \"Additionally, there could be potential injuries to the ankle and foot.\"\n\nThe surgery included the placement of a titanium nail in Woods' tibia for stabilization and the release of his calf compartment to prevent compartment syndrome. The complications arising from this injury, such as debilitation, loss of strength, early arthritis, and loss of joint motion, especially in the foot and ankle, are a major concern for Woods' future in golf.\n\nDr. Provencher explained, \"The healing of the talus bone, which is crucial for ankle function, is paramount. If the talus bone fails to heal properly, it could limit Tiger's ability to walk normally, let alone play golf.\"\n\nThe road to recovery for Woods will be long and arduous.

Instead, Harris will focus on the practical work of the council.\n\nThe National Space Council was previously led by Pence during the Trump administration, which had revived the council in 2017. The council's operation will continue under the executive order from 2017, with an ongoing review for potential changes.\n\n\"Under Vice President Harris' leadership, the National Space Council will assist the President in forming national space policies and strategies, balancing civil, commercial, and national security space activities,\" a senior administration official said.\n\nHarris' other significant responsibilities include diplomatic efforts in the Northern Triangle and expanding broadband access in rural America.

According to the California Franchise Tax Board (FTB), around 750,000 paper checks began distribution on November 1, and 400,000 payments were direct deposited on October 29.\n\nThe combined value of these payments exceeds $857 million, aimed at providing financial assistance to eligible Californians impacted by the ongoing pandemic. Since late August, the FTB has sent out over 1.15 million checks, with an estimated nine million residents expected to receive the stimulus checks in total.\n\nThe GSS II checks target residents who filed a 2020 state income tax return by October 15, 2021, earned $75,000 or less, and could not be claimed as a dependent. Eligibility also required having a Social Security or an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number.\n\nDirect deposit payments may take several days to process and appear in recipients' accounts, while paper checks distribution depends on the recipient's zip code. The expected completion of stimulus check distribution spans into early next year.\n\nThe FTB encourages residents to check their payment eligibility using the online tool provided on the California EITC and Refundable Child Tax Credit website. The tool, which can be accessed at edd.ca.gov/disability/eitc, offers real-time updates on eligibility and payment status.\n\nEstablished under the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), the GSS II checks were designed to provide immediate relief to Californians experiencing financial hardships due to the COVID-19 pandemic. California is one of several states that have expanded their stimulus programs based on federal funding.\n\nThe FTB emphasizes that paper checks will be mailed in batches to reduce mailing costs and minimize delays. Residents who have already received a check but haven't cashed it should destroy the previous check and wait for the new one.\n\nCalifornians who did not file a 2020 state income tax return but are eligible for the stimulus checks can still file and claim their payment. The filing deadline has been extended to January 31, 2022, to accommodate those who missed the initial deadline.\n\nRecipients should be cautious of scams and fraud attempts related to the stimulus checks. The FTB emphasizes that they will never ask for personal information via email, text message, or phone call.\n\nThe FTB encourages residents to sign up for MyFTB, the online service that allows users to view their tax account information, including their stimulus check status.\n\nCalifornia residents who are unsure about their eligibility or have questions regarding the stimulus checks can contact the FTB's Customer Service Center at 1-800-852-5711 or email them at CustomerService@ftb.ca.gov.\n\nThe FTB emphasizes the importance of timely filing of state income tax returns to ensure residents receive their stimulus checks promptly.\n\nThe FTB also encourages eligible residents to file their state income tax returns as soon as possible to expedite the processing of their stimulus checks.\n\nThe GSS II checks are in addition to the federal stimulus checks under the American Rescue Plan Act, which have already been distributed to eligible Californians.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom expressed his support for the stimulus checks, stating that the relief funds are crucial for the state's economic recovery from the pandemic.\n\nThe FTB's stimulus check distribution is part of California's larger economic recovery plan, which includes funding for small businesses, education, and affordable housing.\n\nThe Golden State Stimulus II checks come at a time when California's unemployment rate remains higher than the national average.\n\nThe stimulus checks aim to provide much-needed relief to Californians grappling with rising costs of living, especially in high-cost areas like the Bay Area and Los Angeles.\n\nThe FTB's distribution of stimulus checks under the Golden State Stimulus II program marks a significant step in California's ongoing efforts to mitigate the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its residents.\n\nAs the distribution of stimulus checks continues, the FTB urges residents to remain vigilant against scams and fraud attempts related to the payments.\n\nThe FTB's stimulus check program is a testament to California's commitment to supporting its residents during the ongoing pandemic and beyond."}

Though Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva quickly labeled the incident an \"accident,\" car accident experts and investigators are questioning the initial assessment, suggesting Woods may have been asleep or not paying attention before the collision.\n\nAccording to consultant and car accident analysis expert witness Jonathan Cherney, \"The lack of skid marks and the vehicle's position after the crash indicate that Woods did not lose control due to excessive speed but rather inattention.\"\n\nFelix Lee, an accident reconstruction expert with the Expert Institute, concurred, \"The vehicle's anti-lock brakes may explain the absence of skid marks. Since these systems prevent the wheels from locking up during hard braking, the tires continue to roll, preventing the creation of skid marks.\"\n\nRami Hashish, Principal at the National Biomechanics Institute, weighed in on the collision's aftermath, \"The vehicle traveled straight on a curved road, went off the road, hit a tree, and rolled over. Woods' lower right leg was broken as a result. The damage to the vehicle suggests a late brake application, possibly indicating Woods was unconscious or asleep until off the road.\"\n\nSheriff Villanueva stressed, \"Impairment was ruled out, and we don't have any reason to believe that Mr. Woods was under the influence of anything.\" Graciela Medrano, a sheriff's deputy, added, \"Mr. Woods was cooperative at the scene and did not exhibit any signs of impairment.\"\n\nHowever, some experts are skeptical of the quick determination. Cherney stated, \"It's premature to label this an accident without thoroughly analyzing the vehicle's black box data and Tiger Woods' medical records for any potential medications.\"\n\nThe 2017 incident, where Woods was found asleep at the wheel with several substances in his system, raises additional questions. Hashish explained, \"Considering Woods' history, negligence might be involved. It's essential to explore every possible factor to understand what led to this crash.\"\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding the crash, Woods is reportedly recovering from surgery and in good spirits. A representative for Woods stated, \"Tiger is doing well, and continues to focus on his recovery.\" No further updates on his condition have been provided."}

Over Additional Stimulus Money for American Families, Child Tax Credit Payments in Limbo\n\nBALTIMORE (WBFF/WKRC) – The debate in Washington D.C. over additional stimulus money for American families continues, with discussions centered around the Child Tax Credit (CTC) payments that were expanded under the American Rescue Plan.\n\nPrevious COVID-19 relief bills included stimulus payments of $1,200, $600, and $1,400 for eligible individuals, with the last signed into law by President Biden in March 2021. The American Rescue Plan took things a step further by expanding the federal Child Tax Credit, providing direct payments to families.\n\nUnder this expansion, families receive $300 for each child under 6 and $250 for each child ages 6 to 17 between July and December of 2021. For instance, a family with one child under 6 will receive $1,800 by December 2021 through the advanced payments.\n\nFamilies not normally required to file a tax return could still benefit if they notified the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) by November 15, 2021. These eligible families will receive half of their total Child Tax Credit in a single payment on December 15, 2021. The potential one-time payments are up to $1,800 for each child under 6 and up to $1,500 for each child ages 6 to 17.\n\nThe future of the expanded Child Tax Credit is uncertain, with the Biden administration aiming to make it permanent. However, Democratic Senator Joe Manchin from West Virginia has expressed his desire to make changes to the CTC payments. Manchin is advocating for modifications that would limit the number of eligible children per family and cap the total amount of the payment.\n\nManchin's proposal comes as an attempt to address concerns over inflation and deficit spending. The Senator's stance is in contrast to the Biden administration's plans to make the expanded CTC a permanent feature.\n\nPresident Biden's Build Back Better agenda, which includes extending the expanded Child Tax Credit through 2025, faces an uphill battle in the Senate due to the closely divided chamber. The ongoing negotiations among Democrats could impact the future of these payments and the financial assistance they provide to millions of American families.\n\nFamilies eagerly await the outcome of these discussions, hoping for continued support during these challenging economic times. The uncertainty surrounding the Child Tax Credit payments adds to the financial stress felt by many households across the United States.\n\nBoth sides of the debate argue for the best interests of American families and the nation's economic recovery. As the negotiations continue, it remains to be seen what the future holds for the expanded Child Tax Credit and the relief it provides to millions of families."}

(AP) – The New Orleans Saints dashed the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' division title celebration hopes with a 9-0 shutout win on Sunday. led by a dominant defensive performance, the Saints extended their regular-season winning streak against the Buccaneers to seven games.\n\nTom Brady, Tampa Bay's quarterback, expressed his frustration after the game, acknowledging that his team didn't execute well across the board. \"We just didn't get it done today,\" Brady said. \"Give credit to the Saints; they played a great game.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Taysom Hill filled in admirably for the Saints at quarterback in the absence of Drew Brees, who was out with ribs and chest injuries. Hill completed 18 of 23 passes for 182 yards and led the team in rushing with 71 yards on seven carries.\n\nThe Saints' defense, led by Cameron Jordan, was the star of the show. Jordan recorded two sacks, giving him 100.5 for his career, and wreaked havoc in the Bucs' backfield throughout the game. Dennis Allen, Saints' defensive coordinator who acted as head coach in Sean Payton's absence due to COVID-19 protocols, praised his defense's performance. \"Our guys came to play today,\" Allen said. \"They understood the importance of this game and rose to the occasion.\"\n\nBrady and the Buccaneers' high-powered offense were held scoreless for the first time in his 255 career starts, including playoff games. The Bucs managed just 183 total yards and 10 first downs. Bruce Arians, Tampa Bay's head coach, was disappointed with his team's performance. \"We didn't play well enough to win,\" Arians said. \"New Orleans did a great job of shutting us down.\"\n\nThe Saints' victory puts them in playoff position, holding the conference's final wild card spot with a 7-7 record. The defeat prevented the Buccaneers from clinching their first division crown since 2007, keeping them three games ahead in the NFC South with a 9-3 record and three weeks remaining in the regular season.\n\nThe Saints' strategy involved a strong defensive line performance, with Jordan, Marcus Davenport, and David Onyemata combining for six sacks. The defensive front kept Brady under pressure throughout the game, making it difficult for him to find a rhythm.\n\nBrady acknowledged the Saints' defensive prowess, stating, \"They played a great game up front. We just couldn't get anything going.\" Hill, on the other hand, praised his team's resilience, saying, \"We knew it wouldn't be easy, but we kept fighting. That's what champions do.\"\n\nThe Saints will travel to Carolina for their next game, while the Buccaneers host the New York Jets. The NFC South title race is far from over, with both teams eager to make a statement in the final weeks of the regular season."}

The focus of the inquiry is the handling of firearms on the set, with the head armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, at the center of allegations of negligence and improper gun handling.\n\nAccording to multiple sources, Gutierrez-Reed, 24, was reportedly careless with guns on the set of \"Rust,\" with one incident involving the alleged handing of an improperly checked weapon to an 11-year-old actress, Ryan Kiera Armstrong, on a previous film set.\n\nThe New Mexico Occupational Health and Safety Bureau is currently investigating the circumstances surrounding the fatal shooting on October 21, 2021. The incident occurred during a rehearsal when Alec Baldwin, who was portraying the lead character, discharged a prop gun, striking Hutchins in the chest and Souza in the shoulder.\n\nTwo production sources familiar with the situation have revealed an incident where Gutierrez-Reed handed a loaded weapon to a child actor without checking for barrel obstructions. This alleged incident caused crew members to intervene, and filming was halted until the firearm was properly checked.\n\nGutierrez-Reed had previously expressed concerns about her experience level for the role of head armorer on \"Rust,\" which was her second film in this capacity. The first film, \"The Old Way,\" was completed without any major issues.\n\nPrior to the fatal shooting on \"Rust,\" crew members had raised safety concerns due to previous accidental prop gun discharges. These incidents had reportedly occurred on set and during rehearsals.\n\nThe fatal shooting on \"Rust\" is believed to have been caused by a misfired prop gun that contained a live round. It is still unclear how a live round ended up in the gun, but investigations are ongoing.\n\nThe New Mexico Occupational Health and Safety Bureau's investigation could potentially result in civil penalties being imposed on the production company if any violations are found.\n\nGutierrez-Reed was reportedly responsible for overseeing the handling and safety of all firearms on the set of \"Rust.\" She was also responsible for ensuring that all crew members were properly trained in the handling of prop guns.\n\nAccording to sources, Gutierrez-Reed had a team of assistants who helped her in her role as head armorer. It is unclear whether any of them were present during the incident with the child actress.\n\nThe fatal shooting on \"Rust\" has brought renewed attention to the use of prop guns on film sets and the importance of adhering to strict safety protocols. The incident has also highlighted the need for proper training and experience for those handling firearms on set.\n\nHalyna Hutchins was a highly respected cinematographer who had worked on numerous films and TV shows throughout her career. Her tragic death has left the film industry in mourning and has raised concerns about the safety of film sets.\n\nJoel Souza, the director of \"Rust,\" was reportedly in stable condition following the shooting incident. He was treated at a local hospital and has since returned to work on the film.\n\nThe investigation into the shooting incident on \"Rust\" is ongoing, and more information is expected to be released in the coming days and weeks. The film's production has been suspended indefinitely, and the future of the project remains uncertain."}

The videos pieced together the chaotic events of Aug. 25, 2020.\n\nRittenhouse, now 18, is charged with killing Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and wounding Gaige Grosskreutz, then 27, during the unrest following the police shooting of Jacob Blake. Rittenhouse has pleaded not guilty, claiming self-defense.\n\nThe jury watched videos that included Rittenhouse's pre-shooting interviews and scenes from the night, culminating in the moment he shot the three men. Rittenhouse, armed with an AR-15-style rifle, had crossed state lines from his home in Antioch, Illinois, to Kenosha, Wisconsin.\n\nProsecutor Thomas Binger asked Kenosha Police Detective Martin Howard about Rittenhouse's actions leading up to the shootings. Howard testified that prior to the shootings, Rittenhouse had attempted to aid protesters and was not involved in any violent confrontations.\n\nHoward: \"He did not engage in any physical fighting or any type of confrontations before the shootings.\"\n\nDefense attorney Corey Chirafisi emphasized the threat Rittenhouse faced, quoting from Howard's testimony. Rittenhouse, Chirafisi argued, had reason to fear disarmament and use deadly force in self-defense.\n\nHoward: \"It's reasonable to fear one's gun could be used against them.\"\n\nSocial media influencer Koerri Washington testified about what she observed that night. She described Rosenbaum chasing Rittenhouse, with Rosenbaum throwing a plastic bag at him before being shot.\n\nWashington: \"He was trying to get close to the defendant, and the defendant was trying to move away from him.\"\n\nThe jury watched efforts to aid the injured Rosenbaum and Grosskreutz, the latter instructing on how to apply a tourniquet. Rittenhouse approached police with raised arms after shooting Grosskreutz but was ignored.\n\nRittenhouse's defense team argued that he was trying to surrender to the officers when he was ignored and continued to walk towards them with his hands raised.\n\nBinger, in his rebuttal, argued that Rittenhouse's actions were not justified, and that he provoked the situation by bringing an AR-15-style rifle to a protest.\n\nThe defense also presented testimony from paramedics, firefighters, and other bystanders who described the chaotic scene and their attempts to aid the injured. The trial is expected to continue into next week, with closing arguments scheduled for Nov. 19.\n\nThe jury, comprised of eight women and four men, will begin deliberations following closing arguments. They will decide whether Rittenhouse is guilty of the charges against him, including first-degree intentional homicide, first-degree recklessly endangering safety, and possession of a dangerous weapon by a person under 18.\n\nThe outcome of this trial has garnered national attention, with both supporters and detractors closely watching the proceedings. Regardless of the jury's decision, it is clear that the events of Aug. 25, 2020, in Kenosha will continue to reverberate through the community and beyond."}

But Taliban commanders expressed concern over ISIS-K's tactics, particularly the use of sticky bombs – improvised explosive devices that can be attached to vehicles.\n\nOne Taliban commander in Jalalabad, speaking on condition of anonymity, said ISIS-K militants had infiltrated Taliban-controlled areas and were using hit-and-run tactics, making it difficult to root them out.\n\nISIS-K's resurgence comes after the group suffered significant losses from both Taliban and U.S. forces since its peak around 2018. According to Taliban security forces, three ISIS-K members were killed in a clash in Nangarhar province last week.\n\nRohan Gunaratna, a professor of security studies at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, warned that the return of the Taliban to power could invigorate extremist groups like ISIS-K and al Qaeda. \"The Taliban's return to power could lead to a resurgence of these groups,\" he said. \"ISIS-K will try to exploit this situation to expand its footprint.\"\n\nISIS-K's strength is estimated to be under 2,000 fighters, considerably fewer than the Taliban's forces. But the group's recruits include former Taliban members and fighters from the Pakistani Taliban (TTP).\n\nFinancial and logistical support to ISIS-K from its parent organization in Syria is believed to have considerably reduced, according to a United Nations report. But the report also suggests internal divisions within the Taliban could lead to defections to ISIS-K, potentially bolstering its ranks.\n\n\"The Taliban's rule is precarious,\" Gunaratna said. \"ISIS-K will try to exploit any weaknesses to expand its influence.\"\n\nU.S. officials have warned that ISIS-K could pose a threat to the U.S. homeland if it gains a safe haven in Afghanistan. In August, the U.S. military carried out a drone strike in Afghanistan that killed ISIS-K leader Abdul Hasan.\n\nMujahid dismissed the threat, telling Reuters that the Taliban were in control of the situation. \"ISIS-K is not a significant threat to us,\" he said. \"We are capable of dealing with them.\"\n\nBut Gunaratna warned that the Taliban's military prowess would not be enough to defeat ISIS-K. \"The Taliban cannot defeat ISIS-K militarily,\" he said. \"They will need to address the ideological appeal of ISIS-K to win the hearts and minds of the people.\"\n\nThe UN report also warned of the potential for a resurgence of al Qaeda in Afghanistan, noting that the group had maintained a presence in the country despite the Taliban's takeover.\n\nGunaratna urged the international community to maintain pressure on the Taliban to prevent the resurgence of extremist groups. \"The international community must continue to engage with the Taliban to ensure that they do not provide a safe haven for extremist groups,\" he said. \"This is not only in the interest of Afghanistan, but also the global community.\"\n\nThe Taliban have pledged to run a peaceful and inclusive government, but their rule has been marked by human rights abuses and restrictions on women's rights. Gunaratna warned that these policies could fuel the appeal of extremist groups like ISIS-K and al Qaeda.\n\n\"The Taliban's repressive policies will only fuel the appeal of extremist groups like ISIS-K and al Qaeda,\" he said. \"The international community must hold the Taliban accountable for their actions and demand that they respect the human rights of all Afghans.\"\n\nDespite the challenges, Gunaratna remained optimistic that Afghanistan could find a peaceful solution. \"It will not be easy, but I believe that Afghanistan can find a peaceful solution,\" he said. \"It will require the cooperation of the international community, the Taliban, and the Afghan people.\"\n\nMujahid, the Taliban spokesman, echoed that sentiment, telling Reuters that the Taliban were committed to building a peaceful and prosperous Afghanistan. \"We are committed to building a peaceful and prosperous Afghanistan,\" he said. \"We will work with the international community to achieve this goal.\"\n\nBut Gunaratna warned that the threat from ISIS-K and other extremist groups would not go away easily. \"The threat from ISIS-K and other extremist groups will not go away overnight,\" he said. \"It will require a sustained effort from the international community, the Taliban, and the Afghan people to defeat them.\""}

With extensive damage in Mississippi and Louisiana, the hurricane left over 1 million people without power as the region grappled with its aftermath.\n\nAccording to Jim Kossin, Senior Scientist at The Climate Service, human-caused climate change is exacerbating the severity of hurricanes like Ida, making them wetter, slower, and generating larger storm surges.\n\n\"We're seeing an increase in the severity of storms, not just the frequency,\" Katharine Hayhoe, Chief Scientist at the Nature Conservancy, explained. \"That's a significant difference and a key impact of climate change.\"\n\nHurricane Ida, fueled by warmer Gulf of Mexico waters, intensified rapidly before making landfall, a phenomenon linked to climate change, according to Tom Knutson, Senior Scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\n\"The oceans' warming trend is causing hurricanes to intensify more quickly,\" Knutson continued.\n\nThe global proportion of Category 3 to 5 hurricanes has been rising, according to data from NOAA.\n\nAs Ida made landfall, it produced over 15 inches of rain in parts of Louisiana, contributing to significant flooding, Scott Perrien, a hydrologist with the US Geological Survey, reported.\n\n\"The increased atmospheric moisture due to warming allows hurricanes to generate more rainfall, making flooding more severe,\" Perrien said.\n\nStorm surges are worsening due to sea level rise, further amplifying the destructive impact of hurricanes, Paul Miller, Coastal Meteorology Scientist at Louisiana State University, explained.\n\n\"We're seeing more storm surges because of the sea level rise,\" Miller said. \"That's a major issue for coastal communities.\"\n\nIn Louisiana, the coastal wetlands, a natural defense against storm surge, are disappearing at an alarming rate, worsening the effects of hurricanes like Ida.\n\n\"The loss of wetlands is a significant problem,\" Hayhoe said. \"They act as a natural buffer against storm surges and can help mitigate some of the worst impacts of hurricanes.\"\n\nExperts warn that rapid greenhouse gas emission reductions are necessary to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change on hurricane severity.\n\n\"If we don't take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we're going to see even more severe hurricanes in the future,\" Kossin cautioned.\n\nHayhoe emphasized the urgency of the situation: \"We need to act now to reduce our carbon footprint and limit the worst impacts of climate change on hurricanes.\"\n\nThe devastation wrought by Hurricane Ida serves as a stark reminder of the escalating threat climate change poses to coastal communities.\n\nAs the world grapples with the consequences of Ida and other extreme weather events, experts call for urgent action to address the root cause: human-caused climate change.\n\n\"We can't afford to ignore the science any longer,\" Hayhoe concluded. \"The future of our communities and our planet depends on it.\""}

Amidst the festive scene, the Prime Time host aired his grievances against those ruining the holiday on his SiriusXM radio show.\n\nAccompanied by his wife Cristina, Chris Cuomo visited a local shop to pick out Christmas decorations, seemingly embracing the holiday spirit despite his earlier sentiments. The couple carefully selected ornaments and wreaths, their laughter carrying through the crisp autumn air as they prepared for the upcoming season.\n\nOn his SiriusXM show, Cuomo expressed his frustration with what he referred to as 'woke folks' who were 'ruining' Thanksgiving, stating it was his favorite holiday. He went on to dismiss the historical context of the holiday, claiming he didn't care about the pilgrims or indigenous peoples for the purpose of the celebration.\n\nThe anchor's stance on Thanksgiving, which he referred to as a day for gratitude, came as a stark contrast to the somber tone set by his brother, former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. Andrew Cuomo shared a positive Thanksgiving message on social media, expressing appreciation for his family and friends.\n\nAndrew Cuomo resigned in August following allegations of sexual harassment that were substantiated in a report by the New York Attorney General. The scandal not only damaged his political career but also had a ripple effect on Chris Cuomo's popularity.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the Cuomo brothers took a toll on Chris Cuomo's primetime CNN show, which hit an all-time low in ratings this month, according to Nielsen Media Research. Cuomo Prime Time drew 684,000 total average viewers last week, a significant drop from its debut in June 2018.\n\nDespite the decline, Chris Cuomo's show remains CNN's highest-rated program as of August.

He questioned whether it was essential to acknowledge the historical context of every celebration, stating that Thanksgiving was about family and gratitude, not the pilgrims or indigenous peoples.\n\nThe anchor's remarks sparked a heated debate on social media, with some agreeing with his stance on cancel culture and others criticizing him for dismissing the historical significance of Thanksgiving.\n\nAmidst the controversy, Chris Cuomo continued to focus on his work, delivering his nightly news broadcast with his signature intensity and charisma. However, the ratings drop and negative publicity could put pressure on the anchor to change course.\n\nCuomo's critics argue that his brother's scandal has tarnished his reputation and damaged his credibility as a journalist. They claim that his biased reporting and defensive attitude toward his brother's misdeeds have turned off viewers.\n\nSupporters of Chris Cuomo argue that he is being unfairly targeted due to his family connections and that his ratings decline is part of a larger trend in cable news viewership. They point to his successful tenure at CNN and his ability to engage audiences with thought-provoking commentary.\n\nRegardless of public opinion, Chris Cuomo remains committed to his role at CNN and his radio show on SiriusXM. He continues to address pressing issues and share his perspective on current events, fueling the ongoing debate about cancel culture and its impact on society.\n\nAs the holiday season approaches, Chris Cuomo's stance on cancel culture and Thanksgiving has become a topic of discussion among media pundits and the general public. Some view his comments as a refreshing departure from political correctness, while others see them as a dangerous dismissal of historical significance.\n\nThe ongoing controversy surrounding the Cuomo brothers and the debate over cancel culture serves as a reminder of the power of public opinion and the complexities of modern media. It also highlights the importance of critical thinking and open dialogue in shaping public discourse.\n\nChris Cuomo's radio show on SiriusXM provides a platform for him to engage in these debates and share his opinions with a wider audience. His ability to spark thought-provoking conversations, combined with his charisma and intensity, has earned him a loyal following."}

The show also saw a reduction of more than 30% in viewership in the 25-54 age demographic. Additionally, CNN experienced a significant drop in women viewers for Cuomo Prime Time, down 30% for the week.

In an exclusive interview with Golf Digest, the 15-time major champion opened up about the terrifying ordeal and the arduous journey to recovery.\n\nWoods revealed that doctors initially informed him there was a nearly 50/50 chance of losing his leg due to the extent of the injuries sustained during the single-vehicle crash. The 45-year-old athlete, who has undergone numerous surgeries over the years, faced an even greater challenge this time as the accident caused significant damage to his right leg and ankle.\n\nDespite the grueling recovery process, Woods expressed acceptance of playing fewer tournaments moving forward, citing legendary golfer Ben Hogan as an inspiration. Hogan, who returned to competitive golf following a near-fatal car accident in 1949, famously adapted his playing schedule to accommodate his health concerns.\n\nWoods admitted that his body could no longer withstand the rigors of professional golf on a regular basis. With a lengthy list of injuries and surgeries under his belt, the golfer acknowledged that his focus would now shift towards competing in selected events while prioritizing his overall well-being.\n\nThroughout the challenging rehabilitation process, Woods isolated himself from the public eye to focus solely on his recovery. The golfer underwent continuous medical treatment, including physical therapy, to regain his mobility and strength.\n\nDuring his time away from the game, Woods also tested his hand dexterity to ensure he would retain his golfing skills. The athlete, who has amassed over $120 million in career earnings, remained committed to returning to the sport he loves despite the odds.\n\nAfter nearly a month in the hospital, Woods returned home to Florida to continue his recovery in a more familiar environment. The golfer, who has been married twice and is the father of two children, relied on the teachings of his late father, Earl, to help him endure the difficult rehabilitation process.\n\nEarl Woods, who passed away in 2006, instilled a strong work ethic and determination in his son. Tiger Woods credited his father's teachings for helping him push through the pain and setbacks during his recovery.\n\nAs of now, Woods is walking without crutches or braces and has resumed golf activities. While his return to competitive play remains uncertain, the golfer remains hopeful that he will be able to make a comeback on the PGA Tour.\n\nWoods is set to make a public appearance at his tournament, the Hero World Challenge, in the Bahamas, which will take place from December 2-5, 2021. The event, which features an elite field of golfers, is expected to be a significant milestone in Woods' recovery journey."}

The ship's unusual voyage caused a significant interruption in the Suez Canal, a crucial maritime route, leading to an international traffic jam.\n\nVesselFinder, a leading nautical tracking service, confirmed the authenticity of the ship's route data, dismissing suggestions of manipulated data. A spokesperson for VesselFinder stated, \"Our data is accurate, and we can confirm that the ship did indeed follow this unusual route before getting lodged in the canal.\"\n\nJohn Scott-Railton, a disinformation researcher at the University of Ottawa's Citizen Lab, described the ship's route and subsequent mishap as \"innocent, but terrible luck.\" He remarked, \"It's quite a coincidence that the ship's route resembled anatomical features before it got stuck. It's just an unfortunate series of events.\"\n\nThe Ever Given, a massive container ship over four football fields in length and weighing over 440 million pounds, was en route to Rotterdam from Shanghai when the incident occurred. The ship's size and weight contributed to the challenges faced in freeing it from the canal.\n\nThe ship became lodged in the canal due to high winds and a dust storm, blocking it sideways. Egyptian authorities and international teams have been working tirelessly to refloat the vessel. An initial attempt to free the vessel involving small Egyptian vessels failed, but partial success was achieved on Wednesday.\n\nDespite fears that the channel might be blocked for days, traffic in the Suez Canal resumed on March 28, 2021. The Suez Canal is a vital link for roughly 12 percent of global trade, connecting Africa and Asia.\n\nBefore the incident, other ships in the canal expressed concern over delays due to the Ever Given running aground. The backlog caused by the Ever Given's predicament will likely take weeks to clear, resulting in significant financial losses for numerous companies.\n\nEgyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi emphasized the importance of the Suez Canal to the global economy, stating, \"The Suez Canal is a lifeline for global trade, and any disruption to its operations has far-reaching consequences.\"\n\nThe Suez Canal Authority (SCA) reported that the Ever Given had been inspected for potential cargo shifts or structural issues that could have contributed to the grounding. Preliminary findings indicated no major issues.\n\nAs the Ever Given remains lodged in the Suez Canal, efforts continue to refloat the vessel and restore normal operations. The incident serves as a reminder of the vital role the Suez Canal plays in global trade and the consequences of any disruptions to its operations."}

In an announcement made on January 7, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg extended Trump's ban until at least January 20, 2021, the end of Trump's term.\n\nThe bans came as a response to Trump's baseless claims of election fraud and his persistent efforts to undermine the democratic process through social media and a rally at the Ellipse in Washington, D.C. Trump's inflammatory rhetoric has long been a concern for social media platforms, as it has been shown to fuel conspiracy theories and disinformation.\n\nGianluca Stringhini, an assistant professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Boston University, supports the ban but warns of potential unforeseen consequences. In an interview, Stringhini stated, \"The ban on Trump's account is a necessary measure to prevent further dissemination of false information and potential incitement to violence. However, we cannot ignore the potential consequences.\"\n\nStringhini's research on online communities and platform moderation has shown that bans on platforms like Reddit can reduce posting activity but can also lead to increased toxicity and radicalization among migrated users. \"Online communities play a significant role in the dissemination of conspiracy theories and disinformation,\" Stringhini explained. \"When a prominent figure like Trump is banned from a platform, his supporters are likely to migrate to alternative platforms or create new ones.\"\n\nThe impact of Trump's amplification of conspiracies from polarized communities has been significant. According to a study published in the journal Science Advances, Trump's tweets were responsible for up to 62% of retweets containing election-related disinformation during the 2020 campaign. With Trump's account suspended, it remains to be seen how his supporters will react and whether they will continue to spread false information.\n\nResearch on banned communities shows a nuanced effect of platform moderation. While fewer users see toxic content, those who do may become more extreme. Stringhini believes that Trump's ban will short-term reduce the spread of conspiracy theories but may make his supporters feel censored. \"The feeling of being silenced can lead to further radicalization and the creation of alternative platforms where they can continue to spread misinformation,\" Stringhini cautioned.\n\nDespite these concerns, many argue that the ban is a necessary step to preserve the integrity of the democratic process and protect public safety. In an interview with CNN, Zuckerberg defended the decision, stating, \"We believe the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are just too great.\"\n\nAs Trump's ban continues, it remains to be seen how his supporters will react and whether they will continue to spread misinformation through alternative platforms. Stringhini predicts that if Trump moves to an alternative platform, many of his supporters will likely follow him. \"We must remain vigilant and continue to monitor these communities to prevent the further dissemination of false information and potential incitement to violence,\" Stringhini emphasized.\n\nIn conclusion, the ban on Trump's social media accounts is a necessary measure to prevent the further dissemination of false information and potential incitement to violence. However, it also comes with unforeseen consequences, including the potential for increased toxicity and radicalization among Trump's supporters. As we move forward, it is essential that we remain vigilant and continue to monitor online communities to prevent the spread of misinformation and ensure the integrity of the democratic process."}

Rittenhouse, now 18, is charged with multiple counts, including reckless homicide and being a minor in possession of a dangerous weapon.\n\nMark Richards, Rittenhouse's attorney, contends that one of the victims, Joseph Rosenbaum, was aiming to take Rittenhouse's gun during the altercation that led to the shootings. In a recent interview, Richards stated, \"The evidence will show that Mr. Rosenbaum was trying to take the gun from Kyle Rittenhouse and Kyle Rittenhouse fired in self-defense.\"\n\nHowever, Kimberley Motley, the attorney representing Rosenbaum's estate, disputes Richards' theory, asserting that Rittenhouse was the aggressor. Motley stated, \"The facts will show that Mr. Rittenhouse was the one who initiated the confrontation, and my client was simply trying to protect himself.\"\n\nThe defense team has also filed a motion to dismiss the gun possession charge against Rittenhouse, arguing that Wisconsin law doesn't apply to his rifle type. Richards stated, \"The statute that Kyle Rittenhouse is charged under doesn't apply to an AR-15 style rifle. It only applies to handguns.\"\n\nRittenhouse had traveled to Kenosha from Illinois amid protests over the police shooting of Jacob Blake. Prosecutors want to introduce evidence of Rittenhouse's prior alleged violent conduct and links to the far-right group Proud Boys at the trial. However, Richards contends that the prior altercation and Proud Boys association are irrelevant to the case.\n\nRichards stated, \"My client was there to provide first aid and help protect property. He had no intention of getting involved in any violent confrontations. The evidence will show that.\"\n\nThe incident has polarized opinions, with some painting Rittenhouse as a white supremacist, while others see him as a gun rights symbol. Richards emphasized that the trial should focus on the facts of the case and not be influenced by political or ideological biases.\n\n\"This case is about self-defense, and the evidence will prove that,\" Richards said.\n\nMotley also expressed her confidence in the case, stating, \"The evidence will show that Mr. Rittenhouse was the aggressor, and my client was acting in self-defense.\"\n\nA hearing on the motions is scheduled for Sept. 17, with Rittenhouse's trial set to begin on Nov. 1. Both sides are preparing for a lengthy and high-profile trial that is expected to draw national attention.\n\nIn the meantime, the families of the victims and the community of Kenosha continue to grapple with the aftermath of the shootings, hoping for closure and justice.\n\nRichards concluded, \"We believe that the evidence will exonerate Kyle Rittenhouse, and we look forward to presenting it in court.\"\n\nMotley added, \"We will let the evidence speak for itself and trust that the jury will reach a fair and just verdict.\""}

Hutchins, 42, was killed after being accidentally shot with a prop gun by actor and producer Alec Baldwin.\n\nThe incident has sparked outrage and raised questions about workplace safety negligence, as Baldwin, who was also the star of the film, reportedly did not check the gun himself before use. In a statement, IATSE (International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees) Local 44, which represents armorer's crews, noted, \"The safety of every single crew member, regardless of their role on a film set, is the responsibility of the film's producers.\"\n\nHowever, this fatal incident did not occur in a vacuum. Workers on the set of \"Rust\" had been dealing with a myriad of issues, including broken promises regarding housing and excessive work hours, contributing to an environment of unsafe working conditions.\n\nSara Nelson, International President of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, who has been a vocal advocate for workers' rights, shared her perspective on the situation: \"It's not just about safety on set; it's about fair labor practices. We can't separate those issues.\"\n\nThe incident occurred against the backdrop of broader labor disputes within the film industry, with IATSE members demanding better working conditions. A tentative agreement that could avert a potentially devastating strike was reached on October 27, 2021, but it may be rejected by members if deemed insufficient.\n\nThe possibility of a countrywide IATSE strike looms, reflecting a wider resurgence in labor militancy across various sectors. Current labor unrest sees at least 40 U.S. strikes in progress, with new strikes anticipated across different industries, including:\n\n  • Piedmont airlines flight attendants, who have been on strike since October 13, 2021, over issues such as health care, job security, and wages.\n  • Healthcare workers at Kaiser Permanente, who went on strike on September 13, 2021, demanding better pay and working conditions.\n\nMoreover, strikes at Kellogg's and John Deere continue, with both companies attempting to break strikes through hiring strikebreakers and other means.\n\nThe labor actions demonstrate the growing power of workers as they assert their rights independently of legislative solutions. As Nelson emphasized, \"Strikes are a powerful tool in the labor movement, and they send a clear message to employers that workers are not afraid to take a stand for what they believe in.\"\n\nThis moment of labor unrest reflects a broader call for systemic changes in labor rights, as workers increasingly recognize the importance of collective action in achieving fair wages, safe working conditions, and equitable treatment."}

With no immediate solution in sight, these animals face a likely death due to the lack of food, water, and space.\n\nGabriel Păun, the EU director for Animals International, called this situation \"the worst maritime animal welfare tragedy in history.\" He expressed deep concern over the plight of these animals and urged for urgent action. \"The situation in the Suez Canal is dire,\" Păun said. \"Thousands of animals are at risk of dying due to the lack of food and water. It's a shame that we have to witness such a catastrophe in the 21st century.\"\n\nApproximately 130,000 of these animals originated from Romania, which has been criticized for its poor practices in live animal exports. According to the Romanian National Sanitary Veterinary and Food Safety Authority (ANSVSA), there is enough food and water for a few days. However, live animal exports from the country have been suspended, leaving these animals in limbo.\n\nUnder EU law, ships carrying live animals are mandated to have 25% more food than planned. However, this rule is often not followed, putting animals at risk during transportation. When asked about this issue, Păun was critical of the lack of transparency and regulation. \"Mortality rates on these ships are not reported due to EU legislation,\" he said. \"It's a vicious cycle where animal welfare takes a back seat to profit.\"\n\nRomania has faced criticism from the European Commission for its live animal export practices. In the past, Romania has failed to meet transport conditions, leading to the deaths of thousands of animals. \"It's high time for Romania to reconsider its live animal exports and focus on exporting processed meat instead,\" Păun suggested.\n\nDespite the recognition of benefits in exporting processed meat, Romania continues live animal exports. The European Commission has urged Romania to improve its animal welfare standards and transition to processed meat exports. However, the Romanian government has yet to take decisive action.\n\nThe European Livestock and Meat Trades Federation (UECBV) supports the transition to processed meat exports. \"Processed meat exports are a more humane and profitable alternative,\" said Christiane Lambert, president of UECBV. \"It's time for Romania to join the rest of Europe in prioritizing animal welfare and economic sustainability.\"\n\nAs the situation in the Suez Canal remains uncertain, the fate of these 200,000 live animals hangs in the balance. The international community, animal welfare organizations, and governments must work together to find a solution that prioritizes the welfare of these animals and upholds EU regulations.\n\nPăun echoed this sentiment, urging for immediate action. \"The lives of these animals are in our hands,\" he said. \"We cannot stand idly by and watch as they suffer. It's time for action, it's time for change.\""}

Macdonald's representative revealed that he had been privately battling cancer for the past nine years.\n\nLori Jo Hoekstra, Macdonald's producing partner, shared in a statement, \"He was most proud of his comedy. He never wanted the diagnosis to affect the way he lived his life, or the way that others saw him. And it didn't. His most important thing was making people laugh. During this difficult time, we ask that his privacy, and the privacy of his family, be respected.\"\n\nBorn in Quebec City, Canada, Macdonald started his career writing for the popular sitcom Roseanne. He joined SNL in 1993 and quickly became a fan favorite for his unique comedic voice and deadpan delivery as a Weekend Update anchor.\n\nMacdonald's tenure at SNL came to an end in 1998 when he was removed from the Weekend Update desk, a decision he later attributed to NBC West Coast president Don Ohlmeyer's disapproval of his O.J. Simpson jokes. \"I don't want to be part of a system that doesn't allow me to make a joke like that,\" Macdonald said in a 2019 interview with The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nSNL issued a statement mourning the loss of Macdonald, highlighting his unflinching integrity and humor. \"Norm was a pioneer in our show's history.

Monika Bickert, Facebook's Vice President of Global Policy Management, echoed this sentiment, stating, \"We believe the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are just too great.\"\n\nYouTube also took down a video of Trump, announcing measures against misleading election fraud claims.

Former Facebook security chief Alex Stamos voiced his concerns, stating, \"Facebook has been complicit in spreading radical content, and it's going to take a long time to repair the damage.\"\n\nSocial media platforms have been grappling with misinformation, particularly from Trump and his supporters, for years. Twitter has previously resisted suspending Trump's account despite policy violations. The recent actions against Trump are among the most stringent responses from these platforms to date, but it remains to be seen whether they will be enough to mitigate the risks of further violence and misinformation."}

Her background as a prosecutor, California Attorney General, and Senator has given her a deep understanding of the systemic issues that disproportionately affect marginalized communities.\n\nOne of Harris's first acts as Vice President was to ensure inclusive policy, such as fair allocation of federal COVID-19 funding and championing relief for Black and minority-owned small businesses. This proactive approach to addressing the needs of underserved communities is a testament to her commitment to equity and justice.\n\nHarris is recognized for her effective communication style, marked by composure, honesty, and an ability to evoke joy during challenging times.

As the first woman, the first Black person, and the first South Asian American to hold the office, she represents a break from the past and a step towards a more inclusive future.\n\nHarris's election also serves as a reminder of the progress that has been made in American politics. Though there is still much work to be done, the fact that a woman of color can now occupy the second-highest office in the land is a testament to the power of perseverance and determination.\n\nThe road to the vice presidency was not an easy one for Harris.

A source close to the situation claimed that Chris Cuomo sought advice on how to target Dean by painting her as a 'far right crazy.'\n\nAccording to reports, Chris Cuomo and his brother's aide, Melissa DeRosa, allegedly discussed strategies to discredit Dean as a right-wing commentator. However, Rich Azzopardi, spokesman for Andrew Cuomo, denied any involvement in such actions.\n\nAzzopardi stated, \"The Governor has no involvement in this whatsoever. It's Janice Dean versus Chris Cuomo, and they've been going at it for a long time.\"\n\nDespite Azzopardi's denial, reports suggest that Chris Cuomo was not only targeting Dean but also using his media connections to gather information on his brother's accusers.\n\nFollowing the revelation of Chris Cuomo's involvement in helping his brother's team amid the sexual misconduct allegations, CNN suspended him from the network. However, a new allegation of sexual misconduct against Cuomo at ABC News led to his eventual termination.\n\nCuomo had previously offered extensive help to his brother's team, providing them with detailed information on the accusers and their allegations. One of his brother's accusers, Lindsey Boylan, claimed that Chris Cuomo even reached out to her directly to try and gather information.\n\nBoylan stated, \"I've been approached by reporters, including Chris Cuomo, who tried to pry into my personal life and my allegations against his brother.\"\n\nAs the situation continues to unfold, it raises questions about the extent to which members of a political family will go to protect one another and discredit their critics.\n\nIn response to the allegations against him, Chris Cuomo issued a statement, saying, \"I never made calls to the press about my brother's situation. Never. I never attacked Norah O'Donnell or Janice Dean or anyone else.

While such incidents are incredibly rare, the tragic event has fueled speculation and misconceptions about the use of firearms on movie sets.\n\nAs a union armorer and expert gun handler based in Los Angeles, I have spent years working on Westerns and various film productions, ensuring the safety and authenticity of firearms used on set. In this opinion piece, I will discuss the multiple steps and safety measures in place to avoid accidents with firearms and debunk common myths surrounding the 'Rust' tragedy.\n\n\"Safety is always our number one priority,\" says Joey Dillon, a seasoned union armorer and expert gun handler. \"We take numerous precautions to ensure the wellbeing of cast and crew members.\"\n\nMost firearms used on film sets are real and require extensive paperwork, permits, and monitoring. They are often rented from licensed firearms dealers or private collectors and must undergo a thorough inspection before being allowed on set.\n\n\"When we receive a firearm, we first check its condition and ensure it's in good working order,\" explains Dillon. \"We also make sure it has the proper paperwork and that it's registered with the production.\"\n\nRevolvers and blank rounds are a common sight on movie sets. Blank rounds, also known as dummy rounds, are specifically designed for use in firearms during filming. These rounds do not contain gunpowder and are used to simulate the sound and recoil of a real gunshot.\n\nDillon elaborates on the use of revolvers and blank rounds: \"When using a revolver on set, we always check the cylinder to ensure it's empty. We also use dummy rounds, which are specially designed not to fire but still provide the sound and feel of a real gunshot.\"\n\nSafety measures on set include actor training, rehearsals with \"cold\" guns, checking for obstructions in the gun barrel, and using protective gear. Actor training is essential, as they must learn how to handle firearms safely and react appropriately during filming.\n\n\"Rehearsals with cold guns are a crucial part of the process,\" emphasizes Dillon. \"Cold guns are unloaded weapons that are used for rehearsals and to familiarize the cast and crew with the firearms.\"\n\nSafety officers and gun wranglers are always present on set to monitor firearms and ensure safety protocols are followed. They are responsible for checking each firearm before it's used and ensuring that all crew members are wearing appropriate protective gear.\n\nLive rounds are generally prohibited on set, with the exception of certain educational scenarios, such as historical reenactments or military training films.\n\nWhen live firing is necessary on set, specific protocols are observed, including checking if the chambers are empty and declaring the gun 'hot' before use.\n\n\"Live firing is a rare occurrence on a film set,\" says Dillon. \"We only do it when it's absolutely necessary and when all safety protocols have been followed.\"\n\nThe 'Rust' tragedy is an unfortunate reminder of the importance of adhering to safety protocols on movie sets. It is essential that everyone involved in the production process understands their roles and responsibilities to maintain a safe working environment.\n\nThe tragedy also highlights the need for continued education and training for cast and crew members regarding firearm safety. Regular workshops, seminars, and safety drills can help ensure that everyone is up-to-date on the latest safety procedures.\n\nUnion organizations, such as the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE), play a crucial role in promoting safety on movie sets. They provide resources, guidelines, and training to help ensure that productions meet the highest safety standards.\n\n\"It's important for everyone to remember that accidents can happen, no matter how many safety measures we have in place,\" says Dillon. \"But with proper training, communication, and adherence to safety protocols, we can significantly reduce the risk of incidents on movie sets.\"\n\nDespite the rare occurrence of accidents like the one on 'Rust,' the film industry remains committed to ensuring the safety and wellbeing of its cast and crew members. This commitment is evident in the numerous safety measures and protocols that are in place on movie sets.\n\n\"We take our responsibilities seriously,\" says Dillon. \"The safety of our cast and crew is our top priority, and we will continue to work diligently to maintain a safe working environment.\"\n\nThe tragic event on the 'Rust' set serves as a reminder of the importance of adhering to safety protocols and the need for continued education and training. By working together and maintaining a strong commitment to safety, the film industry can continue to produce high-quality films while ensuring the safety and wellbeing of its cast and crew members.\n\nAs the film industry moves forward, it is essential that we learn from the 'Rust' tragedy and use it as an opportunity to strengthen safety measures and protocols. By doing so, we can create a safer working environment for everyone involved in film production."}

County Sheriff's Department Seeks Black Box Data, No Warrant for Blood\n\nThe Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department obtained a search warrant for the black box from Tiger Woods' crashed car, but there is no plan to seek a warrant for the golfer's blood to determine if he was under the influence at the time of the accident, Sheriff's Deputy John Schloegl confirmed to USA TODAY.\n\nSchloegl emphasized that the investigation is part of a routine probe and does not necessarily indicate a criminal investigation. \"We're looking at the data from the car's event data recorder, or black box, which could provide valuable information regarding the vehicle's speed, steering, brake application, and acceleration before the crash,\" he explained.\n\nAccording to Schloegl, a warrant for the black box requires probable cause that a crime was committed, which is not necessarily the case here. \"We're focusing on the facts and gathering as much evidence as possible to piece together what happened,\" he added.\n\nJonathan Cherney, an accident reconstruction expert and professor at the University of California, Berkeley, suggested that Woods may not have been paying attention or could have even been asleep at the wheel based on early reports and the location of the crash scene. \"It's not uncommon for drivers, especially older ones, to fall asleep at the wheel, especially if they have a condition like sleep apnea,\" he said.\n\nSheriff Alex Villanueva initially called the crash \"purely an accident,\" but the department has not yet concluded the cause. \"We're still in the process of gathering evidence and conducting interviews,\" Villanueva told USA TODAY. \"It's too early to make any definitive statements about the cause of the crash.\"\n\nIn 2017, Woods was found asleep at the wheel with various medications in his system, but no evidence of impairment was observed at the scene.

The account, which had more than 57,000 tweets, was a significant tool for Trump's direct communication with the public.\n\n\"After close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around them we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence,\" Twitter Safety said in a statement.\n\nThe suspension came after a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol building on January 6, 2021, in an attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Five people died as a result of the violence.\n\nPeter Costanzo, an online marketing director who helped Trump join Twitter in 2009, suggested the @realDonaldTrump handle. \"He was very excited about it,\" Costanzo told The Associated Press. \"He loved the idea of being able to communicate directly with his supporters.\"\n\nTrump used the platform extensively during his presidency, often bypassing official media channels.

The city is on edge, with ongoing protests over another police shooting in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Center.\n\nChauvin, 45, is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd's May 25, 2020, death. He faces up to 40 years in prison for the most serious charge. The defense rested its case after two days of testimony, in contrast to the prosecution's two weeks.\n\nWorldwide protests were triggered by bystander video showing Chauvin pressing his knee against Floyd's neck for 9 minutes, 29 seconds, as Floyd repeatedly said he couldn't breathe. Prosecutors argue Floyd died due to Chauvin's knee pressed against his neck or close to it for 9 1/2 minutes. The medical examiner testified that Floyd's heart stopped while Chauvin had his knee on Floyd's neck.\n\nThe defense, meanwhile, aimed to present Chauvin's actions as reasonable and suggested Floyd's death was due to health issues and drug use. The only time Chauvin has been heard defending himself was through body-camera footage shown to the jury.\n\nThe jury of six women and six men, including two alternates, has heard testimony from more than 40 witnesses, including police officers, medical experts and bystanders. They have seen numerous videos, including bystander footage of Floyd's arrest and body-camera footage from the officers involved.\n\nProsecutors called several use-of-force experts who testified that Chauvin's use of force against Floyd was excessive and violated department policy. Defense witnesses testified that Chauvin followed his training and that Floyd's death was not caused by the officer's actions.\n\nOne of the prosecution's key witnesses was Dr. Martin Tobin, a pulmonologist who testified that the way Floyd was pinned to the pavement prevented him from getting enough oxygen. Floyd's autopsy report listed heart disease and fentanyl and methamphetamine use as contributing factors in his death, but Tobin said Floyd would not have died if not for Chauvin's actions.\n\nThe defense called several medical experts who testified that Floyd's use of drugs and underlying health conditions were the cause of his death. The defense also called police use-of-force experts who testified that Chauvin's actions were reasonable.\n\nOne of the defense's key witnesses was Barry Brodd, a use-of-force expert who testified that Chauvin's actions were reasonable and that Floyd died due to his underlying health conditions and drug use. Brodd also testified that Floyd's behavior leading up to his arrest, including his refusal to comply with officers and his struggle to get back into his car, contributed to his death.\n\nThe jury also watched body-camera footage of Floyd's arrest and Chauvin's interview with investigators after Floyd's death. In the footage, Chauvin can be heard telling another officer that he thought Floyd was a \"big dude\" and that Floyd \"kept fighting\" even after he was on the ground.\n\nChauvin's decision not to testify was a surprise to some legal experts, who had expected him to take the stand and explain his actions. But others said it was a wise move given the strength of the prosecution's case and the potential for damaging testimony.\n\nThe trial is happening amid ongoing protests over another police shooting in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Center. Daunte Wright, a 20-year-old Black man, was shot and killed by a white officer during a traffic stop on April 11. The officer, Kim Potter, has since resigned and been charged with second-degree manslaughter.\n\nThe trial's outcome is expected to have significant implications for race relations in the United States and the debate over police use of force. Regardless of the verdict, it is likely to spark further protests and unrest.\n\nIn the meantime, the city of Minneapolis is on edge, with National Guard troops and other law enforcement agencies on standby to maintain order. Schools have shifted to distance learning, and many businesses have boarded up their windows in anticipation of unrest.\n\nThe trial is expected to conclude with closing arguments on Monday, after which the jury will begin deliberations. It is unclear how long it will take for the jury to reach a verdict.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, the trial of Derek Chauvin is sure to be a defining moment in American history, one that will be remembered for generations to come."}

Replacing Andrew Cuomo, who resigned amid sexual harassment allegations and criticism over his handling of COVID-19 in nursing homes, Hochul pledged to bring ethics and transparency back to Albany.\n\nHochul, a former lieutenant governor since 2015, distanced herself from Cuomo's administration, vowing to remove any aides implicated in unethical practices as reported by the state attorney general. \"I'm going to be a governor for all New Yorkers, not just for those who are in the inner circle,\" she declared during her inaugural address.\n\nThe new governor faces numerous challenges, including managing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, distributing rental assistance, and potentially extending an eviction moratorium. Hochul highlighted her commitment to ethics and promised to support legislation for worker protections and oversight.\n\nProfessor Emeritus of Political Science at Hunter College, Kenneth Sherrill, commented on the significance of Hochul's election: \"Governor Hochul is stepping into a tumultuous situation. New Yorkers are eager for a fresh start and a return to a more ethical and effective government.\"\n\nAndrew Cuomo's tenure was marred by sexual harassment allegations from several women, which led to his resignation. In response to the allegations, Erica Vladimer, Co-founder of the Sexual Harassment Working Group, stated, \"Governor Hochul's election represents a turning point for New York. We are hopeful that she will usher in a new era of accountability and transparency.\"\n\nHowever, questions have arisen over potential conflicts of interest involving Hochul's husband, William Hochul Jr., who works for Delaware North. John Kaehny, Executive Director of Reinvent Albany, emphasized the importance of transparency: \"Governor Hochul must take immediate action to address any potential conflicts of interest. New Yorkers demand transparency and accountability from their elected officials.\"\n\nHochul addressed these concerns during a press conference, stating, \"My husband's employment will not influence my decisions as governor. I will ensure that all conflicts are disclosed and handled appropriately.\"\n\nHochul's political background includes being a moderate Democrat with roots in conservative Western New York. Her tenure faces scrutiny from both progressives and potential gubernatorial candidates as the next election approaches.\n\nProgressive activist groups have criticized Hochul for her close ties to the Cuomo administration and her past support for certain policies, such as hydraulic fracturing (fracking) and charter schools. Meanwhile, potential gubernatorial candidates, including Attorney General Letitia James and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, have announced their intentions to run in the 2022 Democratic primary.\n\nDespite these challenges, Hochul remains committed to her vision for New York. \"I will work tirelessly to unite our state and move forward,\" she stated during her inaugural address. \"Together, we will rebuild a stronger, fairer, and more just New York for all.\""}

The actor, who was diagnosed with Stage 4 small cell carcinoma just a month prior, succumbed to the disease despite undergoing chemotherapy.\n\nIn an interview on \"Dr. Oz\" in 2019, Diamond spoke candidly about his health struggles. \"I've had this pain in my side for quite some time now, and it's been getting progressively worse,\" he said. \"I've had some tests done, and they've come back negative for cancer, but I'm not convinced.

This is a crisis caused by a criminal act,\" President Biden said during a press conference on the situation. The attack, which occurred on May 7, led to the pipeline's shutdown and subsequent fuel shortages in several East Coast states.\n\nDespite Biden's clarification, some conservative figures continued to spread misinformation. Former Florida congressional candidate Chuck Callesto tweeted, \"Joe Biden's policies have created the perfect storm for a gas crisis. And now, a cyberattack has exacerbated the situation.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) echoed similar sentiments on Fox News, stating, \"President Biden is the cause of this crisis with his war on American energy.\" The Colonial Pipeline attack and subsequent fuel shortages had nothing to do with Biden's policies or executive orders.\n\nFox Nation host Tomi Lahren tweeted, \"Let's not forget, this is a man who canceled the Keystone XL pipeline project, the very thing that could help alleviate some of the pain at the pump.\" However, the Keystone XL pipeline would not have had any impact on the current gas shortage.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump also weighed in on the situation, tweeting, \"Joe Biden's incompetence has led to the worst energy crisis in American history.\" Sean Hannity, a Fox News Channel host, also accused Biden of causing the crisis during a segment on his show.\n\nThe Biden administration is already facing multiple challenges, including a disappointing jobs report, inflation signs, violence in Israel, and efforts to manage COVID-19. The gas pipeline shutdown exacerbates public relations challenges for Biden, amidst rising gas prices as COVID-19 restrictions are loosened.\n\nRepublican strategist Doug Heye mentioned that the situation provided an opportunity for conservatives to push their message, amidst other Republican divisions. \"This is an opportunity for Republicans to show they can provide solutions to problems,\" Heye said.\n\nThe narrative of Biden being responsible for the gas crisis gained momentum through social media and conservative commentary, with some going as far as comparing the situation to socialist regimes and the 1979 fuel shortage under President Carter.\n\nBiden administration officials, including Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, have urged against panic buying, stating that the situation is temporary and that the pipeline is expected to be back online by the end of the week.\n\nThe Colonial Pipeline attack is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). The pipeline, which transports gasoline, diesel fuel, and jet fuel, was hit by a ransomware attack that encrypted its data and demanded a ransom payment.\n\nThe fuel shortage caused by the pipeline shutdown has led to long lines at gas stations and price increases in some areas. According to AAA, the national average price for a gallon of gas was $3.01 as of May 11, up from $2.88 a week earlier.\n\nThe Biden administration has taken steps to mitigate the impact of the fuel shortage, including waiving the Jones Act, which requires that all goods transported between U.S. ports be carried on American-flagged vessels. This waiver allows foreign-flagged vessels to transport fuel between U.S. ports to help alleviate the shortage.\n\nQuote from Joe Biden: \"This is not a Biden gas crisis.

The report also disclosed that Woods' blood pressure was too low to administer pain medication following the accident.\n\nJonathan Cherney, a former police detective and forensic crash reconstruction expert, commented on the significance of Woods' condition: \"It's not uncommon for patients to be disoriented or confused following a traumatic incident, especially when they've sustained injuries. Low blood pressure can exacerbate these symptoms.\"\n\nThe report also revealed the discovery of an empty pharmaceutical bottle at the crash scene. However, investigators found no reason to believe Woods was impaired by alcohol or drugs at the time of the crash. Officer Justin Smith, who interviewed Woods post-crash, reported that the golfer was \"somewhat combative\" due to the trauma and shock from his injuries.\n\nAccording to the data report, Woods was traveling over 82 mph in a 45-mph zone when the crash occurred. Vehicle data indicates he applied the gas pedal at 99% just before the crash. There was no evidence of braking or steering to avoid the crash, leading to speculation that Woods might have been unconscious.\n\nSergeant Downing explained, \"The lack of braking or steering input prior to the crash is a concern, but it's important to remember that the availability of this data doesn't definitively prove that Woods was unconscious. It's just one piece of the puzzle.\"\n\nDeputy Kyle Sullivan, who arrived at the scene shortly after the crash, noted that Woods appeared to be \"incoherent and confused\" when he spoke to him. \"His speech was slurred, and he seemed disoriented,\" Sullivan recalled.\n\nThis is not the first time Woods has been involved in a driving incident. In 2009, he received a careless driving citation after crashing into a fire hydrant and a tree outside his Florida home. Five years later, he was arrested for driving under the influence of prescription drugs.\n\nSheriff Villanueva emphasized the importance of the ongoing investigation, stating, \"Our goal is to provide a clear and accurate account of the events leading up to this tragic incident.

A federal judge recently denied a temporary restraining order related to the vaccine mandate lawsuit.\n\nChauvin also faces federal charges for violating Floyd's civil rights, to which he has pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn a statement, Mohrman said, \"We will thoroughly review the record in this case and assess all available legal arguments for appeal. Our focus will be on ensuring that Mr. Chauvin receives a fair and impartial appeal process.\"\n\nMohrman's firm did not respond to requests for comment on the nature of their involvement in the presidential election lawsuit or the vaccine mandate lawsuit.\n\nChauvin's trial, which took place in Hennepin County, was moved from the courthouse in Minneapolis due to security concerns and logistical challenges. Some defense attorneys and legal experts argued that the location change could have prejudiced the jury pool and violated Chauvin's right to a fair trial.\n\nJury sequestration, or the isolation of jurors during a trial, was also a topic of debate during Chauvin's trial. Some legal experts argued that sequestration would have helped prevent outside influence on the jury and ensured a fair trial.\n\nChauvin's appeal is expected to take several months to a year to be resolved. In the meantime, Floyd's family and their legal team are pursuing a civil lawsuit against Chauvin and the city of Minneapolis.\n\nFloyd, a 46-year-old Black man, died on May 25, 2020, after Chauvin pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes during an arrest. Floyd's death sparked widespread protests against police brutality and racial injustice around the world."}

Brady, a seven-time Super Bowl champion, and Stafford, a renowned passer in his prime, bring significant weight to this much-anticipated matchup.\n\nBoth quarterbacks have significantly elevated their teams' performances since joining them. Brady led the Bucs to their first Super Bowl victory in over a decade, while Stafford's arrival in LA marked a new chapter for the Rams' offense.\n\nThe encounter between Stafford and Brady has been a rarity, with only two direct meetings before the upcoming game. Both quarterbacks have tasted victory in these encounters, leaving the outcome of their next bout uncertain.\n\nIn the 2010 and 2014 encounters, Stafford missed due to injury or lost, Brady's performance was notably superior. Detroit Lions safety James Ihedigbo, who played against Brady in the 2014 game, shared his impressions, \"Tom was on fire that day. We just couldn't keep up.\"\n\nStafford's lackluster performance against Brady's teams has been a recurring theme, but the Rams' quarterback is seeking redemption. \"I've had my struggles against Tom and the Patriots,\" Stafford admitted. \"But this is a new chapter. I'm focused on leading the Rams to a win.\"\n\nLooking back at their past games, Brady's teams have enjoyed considerable success when facing Stafford. Former Buccaneers running back LeGarrette Blount, who won a Super Bowl with Brady in 2017, acknowledged, \"Tom brings out the best in everyone around him. When we played against Stafford, we knew we had a chance to win.\"\n\nStafford harbors immense respect for Brady, acknowledging his influence and performance level across different teams. \"Tom's a legend,\" Stafford shared. \"He's proven himself time and time again. I've learned a lot from watching him play.\"\n\nInterestingly, every time Stafford and Brady have directly competed, Brady's team has gone on to win the Super Bowl. Stafford is determined to break this pattern and win the upcoming regular season game.\n\nThe significance of this matchup extends beyond the regular season, with potential playoff implications looming large. With both teams vying for a spot in the postseason, a win in this game could prove crucial.\n\nAs the Rams and Bucs prepare to face off, Stafford is focusing on his performance and leading his team to a victory. \"We've got a great opportunity here,\" Stafford stated. \"I'm confident in our abilities, and I'm ready to give it my all.\"\n\nBrady, on the other hand, remains unfazed by the prospect of facing a formidable opponent. \"Matthew's a great quarterback,\" Brady acknowledged. \"But we're focused on what we can do as a team. Our goal is to come out on top.\"\n\nDetermined to make a statement, Stafford has been working tirelessly with his teammates to prepare for the upcoming game. \"We've got a lot of respect for the Bucs,\" Stafford admitted. \"But we're ready to show what we can do.\"\n\nBrady, too, recognizes the importance of this encounter. \"Matthew's a talented quarterback,\" Brady shared. \"But we've got a job to do. Our focus is on executing our game plan and coming out on top.\"\n\nAs the clock ticks down to the game, both teams are putting in the extra effort to ensure they're ready for the challenge that lies ahead. Stafford and Brady, two of the best quarterbacks in the league, are set to write another chapter in their storied careers.\n\nThe anticipation is palpable as the Rams and Bucs prepare to take the field. The outcome of this game could have far-reaching implications, and both teams are leaving no stone unturned in their quest for victory.\n\nAs the referee blows the whistle, Stafford and Brady lead their teams onto the field, each determined to outshine the other. The crowd roars as the opening kickoff sails through the air, marking the beginning of this highly anticipated showdown.\n\nThe game unfolds with both quarterbacks delivering electrifying performances, their every move closely scrutinized by fans and pundits alike. In the end, it's a hard-fought battle, with neither team giving an inch. But as the final whistle blows, it's the Rams who emerge victorious.\n\nStafford, visibly relieved and elated, shares his thoughts on the win, \"We gave it our all today. It wasn't easy, but we came out on top. I couldn't be prouder of my team.\"\n\nBrady, gracious in defeat, acknowledges the Rams' performance, \"The Rams played a great game today. They deserved the win. We'll regroup and come back stronger next time.\""}

Brady will lead the Tampa Bay Buccaneers against the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LV at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida.\n\nThis marks Brady's first Super Bowl appearance with the Buccaneers after spending the first 20 seasons of his career with the New England Patriots. Brady's impressive resume includes six Super Bowl victories, a record he shares with the Pittsburgh Steelers' Robert Kraft and the Patriots' Bill Belichick.\n\nBrady has amassed an impressive record in Super Bowl appearances, holding a 6-3 record and the most Super Bowl MVP awards with a total of four. He also holds the record for most Super Bowl wins (six) and most total yards thrown (2,838).\n\nBrady's Super Bowl journey began in 2002, when he led the Patriots to a victory over the St. Louis Rams in Super Bowl XXXVI. His first Super Bowl MVP award came in that game, where he completed 14 of 21 passes for 145 yards and a touchdown.\n\nBrady's only two Super Bowl losses came against the New York Giants. The first was in Super Bowl XLII in 2008, where Eli Manning led the Giants to a stunning upset over the undefeated Patriots. The second was in Super Bowl XLVI in 2012, where the Giants once again defeated the Patriots, this time with a last-minute touchdown by Ahmad Bradshaw.\n\nBrady's performance in the previous nine Super Bowl appearances has solidified his status as one of the greatest quarterbacks in NFL history. His ability to rise to the occasion in the biggest games has been a consistent theme throughout his career.\n\nBrady's upcoming Super Bowl LV appearance will be against Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs. Brady defeated Mahomes and the Chiefs in the 2019 AFC Championship game, throwing for 326 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nThe Super Bowl LV will have a reduced crowd due to COVID-19 protocols. The NFL announced that only approximately 22,000 fans will be allowed to attend the game, down from the usual capacity of over 65,000.\n\nBrady's journey to his 10th Super Bowl was not an easy one. After spending 20 seasons with the Patriots, he became a free agent in March 2020 and signed a two-year deal with the Buccaneers.\n\nBrady's impact on the Buccaneers has been significant. In his first season with the team, he led them to a 11-5 record and the NFC South division title. Brady threw for 4,633 yards, 40 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions during the regular season.\n\nBrady's postseason performance has been equally impressive. He led the Buccaneers to victories over the Washington Football Team and the Green Bay Packers to reach the Super Bowl.\n\nBrady's first Super Bowl appearance with the Buccaneers will be a historic moment for the franchise. The Buccaneers have only appeared in one Super Bowl before, losing to the Oakland Raiders in Super Bowl XXXVII in 2003.\n\nMahomes and the Chiefs will be a formidable opponent for Brady and the Buccaneers. Mahomes led the Chiefs to a Super Bowl victory last season, where they defeated the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl LIV.\n\nBrady and Mahomes have faced each other twice before in the playoffs, with Brady coming out on top both times. In the 2018 AFC Championship game, Brady and the Patriots defeated Mahomes and the Chiefs 37-31 in overtime. In the 2019 AFC Championship game, Brady and the Buccaneers defeated Mahomes and the Chiefs 30-27.\n\nBrady's preparation for Super Bowl LV has been intense. He has been working closely with his teammates and coaches to ensure they are fully prepared for the game.\n\nBrady's impact on the Tampa Bay community has been significant. He has been an active member of the community, participating in various charitable events and supporting local businesses."}

The settlement comes after the storm left millions of Texans without power and resulted in at least 210 deaths.\n\n\"This settlement provides much-needed relief for Texans who were unfairly burdened with exorbitant energy bills during last winter's storm,\" Paxton said in a statement. \"My office will continue to fight for consumers and protect them from deceptive business practices.\"\n\nGriddy Energy, which offers a wholesale electricity rate, faced legal action from the Texas Attorney General's office after customers reported receiving bills that skyrocketed during the storm. Paxton's office sued the company for misleading advertising.\n\nFollowing the legal issues, Griddy Energy filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Under the terms of the settlement, former Griddy customers are released from any outstanding balances, unless they choose to opt out.\n\nFormer customers who had paid their bills can seek reimbursement through bankruptcy court.

The settlement resolves those allegations.\n\nGriddy Energy's bankruptcy filing and the settlement come as Texas grapples with the aftermath of the winter storm and its impact on the state's energy infrastructure. The storm highlighted the need for improvements to the state's power grid and led to calls for reforms to the energy market.\n\nPaxton vowed to continue protecting Texans, stating, \"My office will remain vigilant in its efforts to ensure that Texas consumers are treated fairly by energy companies and that they are not subjected to deceptive or misleading advertising.\""}

Named after the late National Football League (NFL) commissioner, Pete Rozelle, the trophy symbolizes the pinnacle of professional football achievement. However, as Tom Brady prepares for his tenth Super Bowl appearance, a contentious debate has emerged: should the Super Bowl MVP trophy be renamed in Brady's honor?\n\nFor those unaware, Tom Brady, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' quarterback, has participated in an unprecedented ten Super Bowls, winning a record-breaking seven of them. This feat places Brady in a league of his own, raising questions about whether it's time to recognize his unparalleled accomplishments with a renamed trophy.\n\nTo gauge public opinion on this issue, I conducted an informal survey, sending out the question to various sports forums and social media platforms. Respondents were asked, \"Do you think the Super Bowl MVP trophy should be renamed for Tom Brady?\"\n\nSupporters of the idea argued that Brady's records speak for themselves. One respondent expressed, \"Brady has redefined what it means to be an elite quarterback. Renaming the trophy in his honor would not only celebrate his achievements but set a precedent for future standout players.\"\n\nOpponents, however, held strong opinions opposing the renaming of the trophy. One respondent stated, \"Rozelle was an integral part of the NFL's history. Renaming the trophy after Brady would dishonor Rozelle's legacy.\"\n\nAnother respondent argued, \"Brady was involved in the Deflategate controversy. Renaming the trophy for him now would be premature.\"\n\nSome suggested renaming the trophy after Brady retires or is inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. One supporter stated, \"It's important to let history play out before making such a significant change.\"\n\nOthers proposed repurposing the Rozelle Trophy for other NFL achievements, such as coach or general manager of the year. One respondent suggested, \"The Super Bowl MVP trophy doesn't need a name change. Instead, we could create new awards for other achievements in the league.\"\n\nThe majority of survey respondents (225 out of 350) supported renaming the trophy for Brady.\n\nHowever, it's important to remember that an informal survey does not represent the broader sports community.\n\nThe debate around renaming the Super Bowl MVP trophy for Brady reflects broader discussions about honoring individuals in sports and commemorating their achievements.\n\nBrady's records are undeniable. He has led his teams to victory in more Super Bowls than any other player in history.\n\nRozelle's legacy, on the other hand, is equally significant. He played a crucial role in the growth and development of the NFL, helping it evolve into the powerhouse it is today.\n\nOne can argue that Brady's accomplishments warrant recognition, but so does Rozelle's.\n\nThe idea of renaming the trophy for Brady is not without precedent. The NBA's Finals MVP award is named after Bill Russell, who won an unprecedented 11 championships.\n\nHowever, the decision to rename an award is not an easy one. It requires careful consideration and consultation with various stakeholders, including the NFL, the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and the sports community as a whole.\n\nUltimately, renaming the Super Bowl MVP trophy for Tom Brady is a contentious issue. It's a debate that raises questions about the significance of individual achievements and the importance of honoring the legacies of those who came before.\n\nWhile the debate rages on, it's essential to remember that Tom Brady's impact on the NFL is undeniable. Regardless of whether the Super Bowl MVP trophy is renamed, his place in football history is secure.\n\nAs we watch Brady continue to defy the odds and lead his team to victory, it's hard not to wonder if this Super Bowl will be his last. If it is, renaming the trophy in his honor might be a fitting tribute to a career unlike any other.\n\nBut if Brady continues to play, the question remains: when, if ever, is the right time to make such a significant change?\n\nRegardless of the answer, it's clear that Tom Brady's legacy will be debated and celebrated for generations to come.\n\nThe renaming of the Super Bowl MVP trophy is just one way to commemorate Brady's achievements. There are other ways to honor him, such as retiring his jersey or inducting him into the Pro Football Hall of Fame."}

According to reports, CNN allegedly ignored sexual misconduct allegations against Governor Cuomo and did not cover a VIP COVID-19 testing scandal involving Chris Cuomo and his family.\n\nSherry Vill, the ninth accuser to come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against Governor Cuomo, claimed that her story was dismissed by CNN. In an interview with the New York Post, Vill stated, \"I reached out to CNN, but they weren't interested. They didn't even want to talk to me.\"\n\nFurther fueling criticism, CNN was accused of having a \"blackout\" on reporting negative news against the Cuomos.

While some, including former President Donald Trump, have hailed Rittenhouse as a hero and a symbol of self-defense against lawlessness, others see his actions and subsequent acquittal as problematic and illustrative of deeper issues with self-defense laws.\n\nThe jury's decision to acquit Rittenhouse, who shot and killed Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber and wounded Gaige Grosskreutz, has left many questioning the current interpretation of self-defense laws. Critics argue that the verdict affords too much power to armed individuals in determining who poses a threat, potentially leading to more armed confrontations at public events and escalating violence.\n\nComparing the Rittenhouse trial to that of the killers of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia underscores the inconsistencies in self-defense claims. Arbery, an unarmed Black man, was pursued and fatally shot by three white men, who claimed they believed he was a burglar. Despite clear evidence of racial profiling and no credible threat to the men's lives, they were initially acquitted of federal hate crime charges. In contrast, Rittenhouse, a white teenager, claimed he acted in self-defense after being attacked during the Kenosha protests.\n\nRittenhouse's decision not to provide medical assistance or immediately contact the police after shooting Rosenbaum is also under scrutiny. Witnesses testified that Rosenbaum had not threatened Rittenhouse before he was shot, and that Rittenhouse had instigated the encounter by aiming his rifle at protesters earlier in the night. This raises questions about Rittenhouse's intentions and the validity of his self-defense claim.\n\nThe actions of Anthony Huber, who attempted to disarm Rittenhouse and was then killed, are highlighted as courageous. Huber, a protester, tried to deescalate the situation and protect others from harm. His tragic death underscores the need for responsible gun ownership and the importance of deescalating situations instead of resorting to violence.\n\nThe incident involving Gaige Grosskreutz, who Rittenhouse wounded, is also used to criticize Rittenhouse's quickness to use his gun. Grosskreutz, an armed medic, approached Rittenhouse with his hands in the air and was shot after Rittenhouse claimed he thought Grosskreutz was reaching for his gun. Witnesses testified that Grosskreutz had his hands in the air and was not posing a threat when he was shot.\n\nThe Rittenhouse verdict could have far-reaching consequences, potentially leading to more armed confrontations at public events and escalating violence. Armed individuals may feel emboldened to intervene in situations where they perceive a threat, potentially leading to tragic outcomes. Tightened gun control and self-defense laws are necessary measures to prevent future tragedies like the Kenosha shooting.\n\nSelf-defense laws must be interpreted in a way that balances individual rights with public safety. Armed individuals must be held accountable for their actions and must deescalate situations instead of resorting to violence. The Rittenhouse verdict sets a dangerous precedent and highlights the need for reforms to ensure that self-defense claims are legitimate and that armed confrontations at public events are minimized.\n\nThe acquittal of Kyle Rittenhouse on all charges sends a troubling message about the use of force in public protests and the interpretation of self-defense laws. It is essential that we continue the conversation about responsible gun ownership, deescalation techniques, and the need for tightened gun control and self-defense laws to prevent future tragedies.\n\nAs we move forward, it is crucial that we learn from the Rittenhouse case and work towards a more just and equitable society where armed confrontations are minimized, and individual rights are balanced with public safety. Only then can we truly honor the memory of those lost in the Kenosha shooting and prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future."}

Chauvin was convicted of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter. These charges carry potential sentences ranging from 40 years for second-degree murder to 10 years for second-degree manslaughter.\n\nDr. Andrew Baker, Hennepin County Medical Examiner, testified that Floyd's death was due to a lack of oxygen rather than any underlying heart condition or drug use. Chauvin's defense argued that Floyd's drug use and preexisting health conditions were the primary causes of his death.\n\nThe second-degree unintentional murder charge required the prosecution to prove that Chauvin unintentionally caused Floyd's death while committing a felony. The third-degree murder charge concerned Chauvin's perpetration of a dangerous act with a depraved mind disregarding human life. The second-degree manslaughter charge involved Chauvin's culpable negligence creating an unreasonable risk of death or great bodily harm.\n\nMedaria Arradondo, Minneapolis Police Chief, called Chauvin's actions \"murder\" and stated that they went against the values and principles of the Minneapolis Police Department.\n\nThe prosecution focused on proving Chauvin used excessive force and that his actions substantially caused Floyd's death due to 'positional asphyxia.' Dr. Martin Tobin, a pulmonologist and critical care doctor, testified that Chauvin's knee on Floyd's neck obstructed Floyd's airway and cut off the flow of oxygen to his brain.\n\nDr. David Fowler, former Chief Medical Examiner of Maryland, also testified that Floyd's death was caused by positional asphyxia due to Chauvin's application of force to Floyd's neck and back.\n\nPolice supervisors and use-of-force experts criticized Chauvin's actions as excessive and contrary to police training. Barry Brodd, a use-of-force expert, testified that Chauvin's actions were not in violation of police policy. However, his testimony was not widely accepted.\n\nRichard Frase, a Professor of Criminal Law at the University of Minnesota Law School, stated, \"It is clear that Chauvin's actions did not meet the standards set by the Minneapolis Police Department's use-of-force policy.\"\n\nThe defense argued that Chauvin's actions were within his training and portrayed the knee on Floyd's neck and back as a control technique. Jerry Blackwell, the prosecuting attorney, countered that Chauvin's actions were \"unreasonable under the circumstances.\"\n\nThe charges against Chauvin differed in their interpretation of Chauvin's intent. The second-degree unintentional murder charge required proof that Chauvin did not intend to kill Floyd but instead caused his death during the commission of a felony. The third-degree murder charge required proof that Chauvin showed a depraved disregard for human life. The second-degree manslaughter charge involved Chauvin's culpable negligence creating an unreasonable risk of death or great bodily harm.\n\nThe jury's guilty verdict marked a significant milestone in the nation's ongoing reckoning with police brutality and the systemic racism that contributes to it. The case has brought renewed attention to the issue of police brutality and the need for police reform. In the words of the Reverend Al Sharpton, \"Justice has been served for George Floyd, but it's just the beginning.\""}

Brady expressed his desire to improve on his previous Lombardi Trophy tossing technique, aiming for an overhand throw with more authority during the team's next championship boat parade.\n\nDuring the podcast, Brady joked, \"You know, last time I threw the Lombardi Trophy, I threw it underhand. I've been working on my overhand throw. I think I can get a little more distance that way.\" Gray laughed and asked, \"Are you planning on trying that during the next parade?\" Brady confidently replied, \"Absolutely.\"\n\nBrady's underhanded Lombardi Trophy toss went viral internationally after the Buccaneers' Super Bowl LV victory in February 2021. The successful toss, which landed in the hands of teammate Cameron Brate, showcased Brady's playful spirit and camaraderie.\n\nHowever, Brady humorously noted on the podcast that the feasibility of an overhand toss depends on his consumption of avocado tequila, adding, \"I mean, it's all about the timing and the balance. And if I've had a few avocado tequilas, it might be a challenge.\"\n\nBrady also shared an anecdote about receiving a warning from the NFL for smashing a Microsoft Surface Pro tablet out of frustration during a game.

The victory marked the first time a quarterback had won a Super Bowl in their team's home stadium. Brady achieved this remarkable feat while playing with a torn medial collateral ligament (MCL) in his left knee, an injury he sustained during his last season with the New England Patriots.\n\nBrady's injury history is well-documented, as he previously tore the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in the same knee during the 2008 NFL season. The MCL injury posed a risk of hyperextension and misalignment during movement, particularly affecting Brady's ability to step into passes. Despite this, Brady managed the injury throughout the 2020 season, limiting practices but still achieving impressive performance stats.\n\nIn an interview with Westwood One Sports, Brady acknowledged that the knee injury occurred before his first snap with the Bucs in training camp. \"I had a little something going on with my knee,\" Brady said. \"But I've been through it before, so I knew what it takes to get through it.\"\n\nBrady's vague comments about the specifics of his knee surgery have left many wondering about the severity of the injury. \"It was pretty serious, but I'm feeling good now,\" he told reporters after the game. Brady underwent surgery in late February, shortly after the Bucs' Super Bowl win.\n\nDespite the injury, Brady led the Buccaneers to an impressive 11-5 regular-season record and a playoff victory against the New Orleans Saints. In the Super Bowl, Brady completed 21 of 29 passes for 201 yards and three touchdowns, earning him the Super Bowl Most Valuable Player (MVP) award.\n\nThe Bucs' victory was a testament to Brady's resilience and determination. \"Tom is a warrior,\" Bucs head coach Bruce Arians said after the game. \"He's the greatest of all time, and he proved it again tonight.\"\n\nBrady's injury history has been a topic of discussion throughout his career. In 2008, he missed the entire season after tearing the ACL in his left knee during the first game of the season. Brady underwent extensive rehabilitation and returned to the NFL in 2009, leading the Patriots to the AFC Championship game.\n\nThis time around, Brady has been rehabilitating the knee in the offseason and is currently working out in altitude near his summer home in Montana. \"I'm feeling good,\" Brady told reporters during a recent interview. \"I'm taking it one day at a time and focusing on getting back to 100%.\"\n\nBrady's injury and subsequent surgery have not deterred him from his goal of continuing to play at a high level in the NFL. \"I love this game too much to give it up,\" Brady said. \"I'll be back next season, and I'm looking forward to it.\"\n\nDespite the uncertainty surrounding Brady's knee injury and surgery, one thing is clear: the future Hall of Fame quarterback is not one to back down from a challenge. His determination and resilience have once again proven that he is a force to be reckoned with in the NFL."}

These threats came in the wake of last week's school shooting in Michigan and similar false alerts at schools across the country.\n\nJessica Bowman, a concerned parent, shared her experience, \"My daughter came home yesterday from school and told me about the threats she had received on Snapchat. She was really scared and worried about her safety.\"\n\nAlveena Delacruz, another Waco High School parent, echoed Bowman's sentiments, \"I've heard from other parents that their kids have been receiving these threats nonstop. It's scary and unsettling. We want to know what the school is doing to ensure our children's safety.\"\n\nWaco ISD has communicated with parents and students about the ongoing investigation into the threats. Alice Jauregui, the district's Director of Communications, assured the public, \"We want to reassure our community that we take every threat seriously. Our security team has worked diligently to investigate these threats and they have been found not to be credible.\"\n\nDespite Jauregui's reassurances, some parents are seeking more concrete actions and information from the school. Bowman emphasized, \"We need to know what safety measures are in place and what the school plans to do to prevent these types of threats in the future.\"\n\nDelacruz added, \"I think the school should consider enhancing security measures, like increasing the police presence or implementing metal detectors. We can't have our children living in fear every day.\"\n\nWaco police have also identified these threats as part of a trending hoax and have confirmed that they are not credible. Jauregui urged parents and students to report any such threats seen on social media instead of sharing them, \"Sharing these threats only adds to the fear and confusion. We encourage everyone to report any suspicious activity or threats directly to the school or law enforcement.\"\n\nBowman expressed her disappointment with the lack of transparency and communication from the school, \"I think the school could do a better job of keeping us informed about what's going on and what they're doing to ensure our children's safety.\"\n\nDelacruz agreed, \"We deserve to know what's being done to protect our kids. We can't just be left in the dark and expected to trust that everything is okay.\"\n\nJauregui acknowledged the concerns and emphasized the importance of open communication, \"We understand the concerns of our community, and we are committed to keeping the lines of communication open. We will continue to provide updates as information becomes available.\"\n\nAs the investigation into the threats continues, parents and students in the Waco community remain on edge, hoping for a swift resolution and increased safety measures to ensure their peace of mind."}

Among those eagerly awaiting updates was Rory McIlroy, a four-time major champion and close friend of Woods.\n\nMcIlroy, who was in Florida competing in the WGC-Workday Championship, emphasized the importance of Woods' survival over his potential return to golf during a press conference. \"First and foremost, we're just relieved that Tiger is going to be okay,\" McIlroy stated.\n\nWoods sustained significant injuries, including multiple fractures and a shattered ankle, requiring emergency surgery. According to reports, the 45-year-old golfer faced a lengthy recovery process.\n\nDespite speculation on Woods' professional future, McIlroy expressed relief that the accident wasn't fatal. \"We all know how much Tiger means to golf, both on and off the course,\" McIlroy shared. \"His humanity, his struggles, and his resilience have inspired generations.\"\n\nWoods' accident drew massive attention, overshadowing the ongoing WGC-Workday Championship in Florida. Players, fans, and media alike expressed concern and support for the 15-time major champion.\n\nDespite the uncertainty surrounding Woods' future in competitive golf, McIlroy believes he will continue to impact the sport in various ways. \"Tiger's foundation, his golf course design business, and his tournament hosting are just a few examples of how he'll remain influential,\" McIlroy noted.\n\nWoods' previous comeback from spinal fusion surgery and subsequent victory at the 2019 Masters was hailed as one of the greatest in sports. McIlroy compared Woods' return to Ben Hogan's comeback after a near-fatal car accident in 1949.\n\nFollowing his spinal fusion surgery in 2017, Woods underwent a grueling rehabilitation process. In 2019, he stunned the world by winning the Masters Tournament, his fifth green jacket and 15th major title.\n\nMcIlroy marveled at Woods' determination and perseverance during his recovery. \"Tiger's ability to come back from such adversity is a testament to his unwavering commitment and passion for the game,\" McIlroy admitted.\n\nDespite the severity of his injuries, Woods remains optimistic about his future. In a statement released on social media, he expressed gratitude for the outpouring of support and vowed to make a full recovery.\n\nGolf fans and pundits alike have debated whether Woods will be able to return to competitive play at the highest level. McIlroy believes that, regardless of the answer, Woods' impact on golf will endure.\n\nWoods' legacy extends far beyond his record-breaking golf accomplishments. As a trailblazer, Woods paved the way for future generations of golfers, particularly those from diverse backgrounds.\n\nFurthermore, Woods' business ventures, including his golf course design company, TGR Design, and his foundation, the Tiger Woods Foundation, continue to thrive and inspire.\n\nMcIlroy reiterated his support for Woods during this challenging time. \"We're all rooting for Tiger's full recovery, and we can't wait to see what he accomplishes next, both on and off the course,\" McIlroy concluded.\n\nAs the golfing community awaits updates on Woods' condition and future plans, McIlroy's words serve as a reminder of the enduring impact Woods has had on the sport and its fans.

The move comes as a result of skyrocketing gas prices during the February winter storm and blackout that left millions without power and heat for days.\n\nThe Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC) announced the approval of the securitization plan, which aims to spread out the financial impact on consumers by converting debt into low-interest bonds paid over decades. The process, approved by state legislators last spring, is designed to protect utility companies from financial losses during extreme weather events.\n\nPaula Gold-Williams, former head of San Antonio's publicly owned utility, CPS Energy, voiced her concerns about the plan. \"This is not a sustainable solution,\" she said. \"It's a Band-Aid on a bullet hole.\"\n\nThe cost of the securitization may be added to Texans' gas bills for up to 30 years, according to the RRC. However, it remains unclear how much monthly bills will increase for individual ratepayers as a result of the securitization.\n\nDuring the winter storm, gas prices surged, leading to massive profits for gas companies. The price spikes drew accusations of price gouging from consumer advocacy groups and politicians.\n\nVirginia Palacios, executive director of Commission Shift, a nonprofit advocacy organization, criticized the commission's handling of the situation and potential future risks. \"The Railroad Commission is prioritizing the profits of a few over the needs of millions of Texans,\" she said. \"The securitization plan sets a dangerous precedent for the future.\"\n\nDoug Lewin, head of Stoic Energy, a clean energy consulting firm, echoed Palacios' concerns. \"The Railroad Commission's decision is short-sighted and irresponsible,\" he said. \"Instead of prioritizing consumer protection, they're prioritizing the profits of gas companies.\"\n\nThe RRC defended the plan, stating that it was necessary to protect utility companies from financial losses during extreme weather events. \"We understand that this is a difficult decision for consumers, but it is necessary to ensure the long-term stability of the energy industry in Texas,\" said a spokesperson for the RRC.\n\nThe securitization plan has been met with fierce opposition from consumer advocacy groups and Democrats, who argue that it prioritizes gas company profits over consumer needs. Critics also point to the large campaign contribution received by Governor Greg Abbott from Kelcy Warren, CEO of Energy Transfer Partners, a major gas company in Texas.\n\n\"Governor Abbott's cozy relationship with the gas industry is a clear conflict of interest,\" said Palacios. \"The people of Texas deserve better. They deserve affordable energy and protection from price gouging during extreme weather events.\"\n\nThe securitization plan is just the latest controversy in a long line of issues related to the Texas energy grid. In the aftermath of the winter storm, the state was criticized for its lack of preparedness and for relying too heavily on fossil fuels. The storm exposed the vulnerabilities of the Texas energy grid and highlighted the need for a more resilient and sustainable energy system.\n\nAs the debate over the securitization plan continues, one thing is clear: the people of Texas deserve a reliable and affordable energy system that prioritizes their needs over the profits of a few.\n\nIn the meantime, consumers are left to wonder how much their monthly gas bills will increase as a result of the securitization plan, and whether their voices will be heard in the ongoing debate over the future of the Texas energy grid.\n\n\"We cannot afford to let the gas industry dictate energy policy in Texas,\" said Palacios. \"It's time for a change. It's time for a future where energy is affordable, reliable, and sustainable for all Texans.\""}

This additional funding is aimed at bolstering cybersecurity efforts, addressing supply chain and tech infrastructure gaps, according to the department.\n\n\"Cybersecurity is a top priority for the Department of Energy, and this funding will help us upgrade our systems, hire more cybersecurity professionals, and protect against evolving threats,\" said Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm in a statement.\n\nGranholm highlighted the need for upgrading software and increasing cybersecurity personnel in the energy sector during a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing. She also emphasized the absence of cybersecurity standards in the pipeline industry, as made evident by the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack.\n\nBrad Smith, President of Microsoft, echoed similar concerns during a recent congressional hearing, stating, \"We need to recognize that the era of self-defense is over for companies, especially those in the critical infrastructure sectors.\"\n\nThe Biden administration is considering ways to improve private sector collaboration with the government on cybersecurity. Secretary Granholm suggested that the government might need more visibility into private sector systems to effectively combat cyber threats. \"We've got to find a way to work together,\" she said.\n\nThe federal civilian cybersecurity budget request for 2022 is $9.8 billion, a nearly 15% increase from 2021. The Pentagon's cybersecurity budget request for 2022 stands at $10.4 billion.\n\nThese requests follow a series of ransomware attacks affecting Americans and disrupting essential services.

Grosskreutz, a trained paramedic, insisted that he did not intend to kill Rittenhouse but was trying to preserve his own life.\n\nGrosskreutz's testimony appeared to bolster Rittenhouse's self-defense claim, as he acknowledged that he believed Rittenhouse was being chased with the intent to harm. The defense argued that Rittenhouse acted in self-defense when he shot and killed two men and wounded Grosskreutz during the tumultuous protests.\n\nGrosskreutz organized a medical corps at the protests and was carrying a gun and providing first aid during the unrest. Unlike Rittenhouse, who obtained his firearm illegally and was not certified as an emergency medical technician (EMT), Grosskreutz obtained his firearm through proper channels and was certified as an EMT.\n\nGrosskreutz testified that he did not consider himself to be participating in the protests but was there in a medical and protective capacity. However, he did accuse Rittenhouse of \"murdering\" another individual, Anthony Huber, during the encounter. The judge instructed the jury to disregard the comment.\n\nGrosskreutz's testimony revealed that he might have unintentionally pointed his gun at Rittenhouse before being shot. According to him, he raised his gun in the direction of Rittenhouse after seeing him being chased by a group of people.\n\nAfter being shot, Grosskreutz underwent several surgeries, losing sensation below the elbow of the injured arm. He is now suing Kenosha law enforcement for $10 million, claiming they shared blame for Rittenhouse's actions.\n\nThe shooting took place on August 25, 2020, during protests over the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, in Kenosha. Rittenhouse, who was then 17, traveled from his home in Antioch, Illinois, to Kenosha with an AR-15-style rifle, claiming he wanted to protect property and provide medical aid.\n\nThe trial, which is being held in Kenosha County Circuit Court, is being closely watched as it could set a precedent for the use of deadly force during protests. Rittenhouse is charged with first-degree reckless homicide, first-degree intentional homicide, and attempted first-degree intentional homicide in the shootings of Huber, Grosskreutz, and Joseph Rosenbaum.\n\nGrosskreutz's testimony marked the second day of the trial, where the defense and prosecution presented their cases to the jury. Rittenhouse himself took the stand on Tuesday, tearfully recounting the events of that fateful night.\n\nThe trial is expected to continue for several more days, with testimony from other witnesses and closing arguments scheduled for later in the week. The jury is expected to begin deliberations on Friday.\n\nIn the meantime, tensions remain high in Kenosha, with both sides of the political divide expressing strong opinions about the case. Some supporters of Rittenhouse view him as a hero who acted in self-defense, while others see him as a vigilante who escalated the situation with his presence and use of deadly force.\n\nAs the trial progresses, it is likely that more revelations will come to light, shedding new light on the events of that night and the wider context of the protests in Kenosha and beyond. For now, the focus remains on the testimony of the witnesses and the legal arguments being made by the defense and prosecution."}

In this fact check article, we will separate fact from fiction regarding key aspects of the ceremony.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic forced significant limitations on the inauguration ceremony. Crowd sizes were restricted, and attendees were required to wear masks and maintain social distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\n\nA notable absence at the inauguration was former President Donald Trump, who declined to attend the event. This marked a departure from tradition, as every living president has attended the inauguration of their successor since 1869.\n\nWashington D.C. experienced heightened security following the pro-Trump riot on January 6, 2021. Thousands of National Guard troops and law enforcement officers were deployed to secure the city and prevent any potential unrest.\n\nMisinformation surrounding the 2020 election and Inauguration Day has been prevalent, with false claims spreading on social media platforms. One such claim was that flags were added to the National Mall to make the inauguration look less empty.\n\nThis claim was rated as \"missing context\" due to the pandemic and security measures in place. In reality, the flags were part of a public art exhibition called \"Fields of Honor,\" representing Americans unable to attend the inauguration due to COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nBiden's inauguration maintained strict coronavirus precautions, continuing practices from his presidential campaign. These measures included virtual events, limited attendance, and mask-wearing.\n\nThe absence of large crowds marked a significant change from traditional inauguration ceremonies, which typically attract hundreds of thousands of spectators.\n\nAnother false claim that circulated was that the National Mall was intentionally flooded to make the inauguration look less impressive. However, this was debunked as there was no evidence to support the claim.\n\nAdditionally, there were allegations that Biden's inauguration was not a legitimate transfer of power and that the election results were fraudulent. These claims have been extensively debunked by numerous fact-checking organizations and courts.\n\nA common myth was that Biden only received 8,000 votes in the 2020 election. In reality, he received over 81 million votes, making it the most votes ever received by a presidential candidate in U.S. history.\n\nMisinformation about the National Guard's role during the inauguration also emerged, with some claiming that they were being used for crowd control or even detaining Americans. However, the National Guard was there solely for security purposes.\n\nA false claim that went viral was that the National Mall was being used as a detention camp for protestors. This was debunked, as there was no evidence to support the claim and the National Mall remained open to the public throughout the inauguration weekend.\n\nThere were also allegations that Biden was not a legitimate president due to his age or citizenship status. These claims have been extensively debunked, as Biden is a natural-born U.S. citizen and met the age requirement to serve as president.\n\nAnother false claim was that Biden's inauguration was funded by foreign governments. However, all inauguration funds came from private donations and the federal government.\n\nMisinformation surrounding the COVID-19 vaccines and their distribution during the inauguration also emerged. There were claims that the vaccines were not effective or that they were being used for population control. These claims have been debunked by numerous scientific studies and health organizations.\n\nAs the new administration begins, it is crucial to remain vigilant against misinformation and to fact-check claims before sharing them. The ongoing pandemic and heightened security concerns have made it more important than ever to separate fact from fiction.\n\nIn conclusion, the 2021 presidential inauguration faced unique challenges due to the coronavirus pandemic and security concerns. Misinformation surrounding the event was rampant, with false claims about crowd sizes, flags, election results, and various other aspects. By fact-checking these claims and separating fact from fiction, we can ensure a more informed public discourse."}

Trump: A Controversial Presidency Marked by Politics, Policy, and Controversies\n\nBorn on June 14, 1946, in Queens, New York, Donald J. Trump began his journey to the White House with a strong background in business and real estate. Trump took over his father's company, The Trump Organization, in 1971, transforming it into a global brand.\n\nIn 2016, Trump stunned the political world when he was elected as the 45th President of the United States, defeating Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. His campaign promises centered around tax reform, deregulation, trade protectionism, and immigration control.\n\nDuring his presidency, Trump's administration made significant strides in foreign policy. In May 2018, the U.S. Embassy was moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, fulfilling a campaign promise. The administration also engaged in historic diplomacy with North Korea, holding three summits with leader Kim Jong-un.\n\nHowever, Trump's presidency was not without controversy. In December 2019, he faced impeachment over allegations of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress regarding a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The House of Representatives impeached Trump, but he was acquitted by the Senate in 2020.\n\nTrump's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic drew widespread criticism. With over 400,000 Americans dying from the virus by the end of his term, many felt his administration's response was inadequate. Trump and his team were accused of downplaying the severity of the virus and promoting unproven treatments.\n\nDespite the election of Joe Biden in November 2020, Trump refused to concede, making unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud. These claims led to the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021, when a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol building in an attempt to overturn the election results.\n\nAs a result of the Capitol riot, Trump became the first president in American history to be impeached twice by Congress. The House impeached him on charges of incitement of insurrection, and the trial in the Senate was ongoing at the time of publication.\n\nThroughout his presidency, Trump remained a divisive figure, with strong support from his base and fierce opposition from his detractors. His policies and actions sparked intense debates and protests, both domestically and internationally.\n\nDespite the controversies, Trump left a lasting impact on American politics. His presidency marked a shift in the political landscape, with issues such as immigration, trade, and foreign policy becoming major points of contention.\n\nAs Trump's time in office comes to a close, the legacy of his presidency remains a subject of intense debate. Some view him as a transformative figure who challenged the status quo, while others see him as a divisive and controversial leader whose actions had far-reaching consequences. Regardless of one's opinion, there is no denying that Donald J. Trump left an indelible mark on American history."}

The announcement comes nine months after Trump was banned from major social media sites, including Twitter and Facebook, for his alleged role in inciting violence at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, Trump criticized Big Tech for suspending his accounts while platforms like Twitter continue to host accounts for groups like the Taliban. \"Big Tech is doing a tremendous disservice to our country. They're making it impossible for you to communicate,\" he said.\n\nTRUTH Social aims to offer a voice to those silenced by Big Tech, according to Trump. He claimed that the new platform would be \"bigger and better\" than other social media sites and would be a \"huge success.\" The preliminary rollout of the social network is scheduled for November, with a full rollout in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nBeyond social media, TMTG plans to launch a subscription video-on-demand service, TMTG+, and enter the cloud-computing space, according to the company's press release. Trump did not provide further details about these plans during the press conference.\n\nTrump's announcement comes after an initial attempt at a blog on his website was abandoned due to low traffic. In July, Trump sued Facebook, Twitter, and Google for suspending his accounts and seeking account restoration and punitive damages.\n\nThe former president was impeached for his alleged role in the January 6 Capitol riots but was acquitted by the Senate in February 2021. Trump has continued to claim that the election was stolen from him, despite there being no evidence to support this claim.\n\nDuring the press conference, Trump accused Big Tech of censoring conservatives and interfering in elections. He also criticized President Joe Biden's administration for its handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan and the border crisis.\n\nSeveral Republican lawmakers and conservative commentators have expressed support for Trump's new social media platform. However, some have raised concerns about the potential for misinformation and incitement to violence on the platform.\n\nTrump's announcement comes as several other conservative social media platforms, such as Parler and Gab, have faced challenges in the wake of the Capitol riots. These platforms have been criticized for their role in spreading misinformation and incitement to violence.\n\nIt is unclear how many users TRUTH Social will attract, particularly given the competition from established social media sites and other emerging platforms. However, Trump's large following and influence could give the platform a significant boost.\n\nThe launch of TRUTH Social marks the latest chapter in Trump's efforts to maintain a presence in the public sphere and to challenge the dominance of Big Tech. It remains to be seen how successful the platform will be and what impact it will have on the political landscape."}

The ensuing chaos resulted in significant damage to the historic building and numerous injuries to law enforcement officers. This article explores the missed warnings, insufficient preparation, and leadership failures that contributed to the insurrection.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the Capitol riot, there were numerous signs of potential unrest. Violent plans were made public online, with groups such as QAnon and the Proud Boys openly discussing coordination. Despite these warnings, law enforcement agencies, including the US Capitol Police, failed to adequately prepare for the possibility of widespread violence.\n\nOn the day of the riot, approximately 1,200 US Capitol Police officers were on duty. However, some officers could not access riot gear due to it being locked in buses. The inability to quickly access essential equipment left many officers vulnerable during the confrontations with the rioters.\n\nThe violence that unfolded on January 6 resulted in 73 Capitol Police and 65 DC Metropolitan Police officers being injured. One US Capitol Police officer, Brian Sicknick, tragically lost his life due to injuries sustained during the riot.\n\nDespite receiving numerous warnings about potential threats, the US Capitol Police did not have a department-wide plan for the day. Many officers were not adequately equipped, and poor communication among law enforcement agencies further hampered their ability to respond effectively.\n\nCommunication failures during the riot left officers feeling abandoned and uncertain about their roles and responsibilities. Some officers reported not receiving clear instructions from their superiors, leading to confusion and disorganization.\n\nBureaucracy also delayed the National Guard response, which did not arrive until hours after the riot began. The slow response time exacerbated the chaos and made it more difficult for law enforcement to regain control of the situation.\n\nA Senate report released in June 2021 offered recommendations to prevent future incidents and criticized the Capitol Police's preparedness and response to the riot. The report highlighted the need for better communication, equipment, and planning to ensure the safety of lawmakers and the general public.\n\nDespite the widespread availability of information about the potential for violence, US Capitol Police leadership underestimated the threats. In hindsight, it is clear that the events of January 6 could have been mitigated with more effective preparation and communication.\n\nLeading up to the riot, online forums and social media platforms were rife with discussions about coordinated efforts to disrupt the certification of the 2020 presidential election results. These threats were not taken seriously enough by law enforcement, and valuable time was lost in the days leading up to the event.\n\nThe US Capitol Police were warned about the potential for violence on January 6, with specific information about the possibility of armed protests. However, these warnings were not acted upon effectively due to poor information sharing and a lack of urgency.\n\nThe rioters were able to breach the Capitol's perimeter due to a lack of manpower and inadequate barricades. Once inside the building, they were able to wreak havoc, damaging property and engaging in violent confrontations with law enforcement officers.\n\nThe US Capitol Police were outnumbered and outmatched by the rioters, who were armed with various weapons, including batons, bear spray, and flags. The officers were forced to retreat in some areas, allowing the rioters to take control of parts of the Capitol complex.\n\nThe chaos that ensued on January 6 was a result of a perfect storm of missed warnings, insufficient preparation, and leadership failures. Had law enforcement agencies taken the threats more seriously and taken appropriate measures to secure the Capitol, the riot could have been prevented or at least mitigated.\n\nIn the aftermath of the riot, there were calls for accountability and reform within the US Capitol Police department. Critics pointed to a culture of complacency and a lack of resources as contributing factors to the department's poor response.\n\nThe events of January 6 exposed significant vulnerabilities in the security of the US Capitol and the broader American democratic process. The insurrection served as a wake-up call for lawmakers and law enforcement agencies to take the threat of domestic terrorism more seriously.\n\nIn response to the riot, the US Capitol Police underwent a major overhaul, with a renewed focus on preparing for potential threats and improving communication and coordination between law enforcement agencies.\n\nThe January 6 insurrection was a dark day in American history, one that exposed the fragility of the democratic process and the importance of effective law enforcement and security measures.\n\nDespite the progress made since the riot, there is still work to be done to ensure the safety and security of the US Capitol and the American people. The events of January 6 serve as a reminder of the importance of vigilance and preparedness in the face of potential threats."}

The ban came after Facebook suspended Trump's account indefinitely for violating its policies against incitement of violence.\n\nShannon McGregor, an assistant professor of journalism and media at the University of North Carolina, expressed her thoughts on Twitter's decision, saying, \"Twitter's permanent suspension of Trump's account is a significant turning point for social media and the role it plays in our political system.\"\n\nTrump's Twitter account, with over 88 million followers, was known for policy announcements, personal attacks, and misinformation. The president frequently used the platform to bypass traditional media outlets and connect directly with his supporters.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to the ban. Kay James, president of The Heritage Foundation, criticized Twitter for its actions, stating, \"Twitter and other social media companies should not censor the speech of elected officials, even those with whom they disagree.\"\n\nTrump denounced Twitter's action in a statement, saying, \"I've been suspended from Twitter because the Radical Left Lunatics and Fascists that rule over there, don't want the truth to be told. They've taken away the power of the people.\" He hinted at creating his own platform, saying, \"Stay tuned!\"\n\nTwitter stated that government accounts like @POTUS are not banned but their use could be limited. The company also banned accounts promoting QAnon conspiracy theories, including those of Michael Flynn and Sidney Powell.\n\nJonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, commended Twitter's decision, stating, \"Silencing hate speech is not an infringement on free speech. It is the responsibility of social media companies to protect their platforms from being used to incite violence and spread misinformation.\"\n\nJohn Matze, CEO of Parler, a social media platform popular with conservatives, defended free speech, stating, \"Parler will always welcome all voices and we believe political ideology does not justify de-platforming. This is the definition of a free society.\"\n\nDemocratic Rep. Bennie Thompson, chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security, welcomed Twitter's decision, stating, \"The President's actions following the Capitol insurrection posed a clear and present danger to our democracy. Social media companies have a responsibility to ensure their platforms are not used to incite violence or spread misinformation.\"\n\nThe ban raises questions about Trump's influence without access to mainstream social media platforms. McGregor stated, \"Trump's ability to reach his supporters directly through Twitter has been a significant factor in his political success. Without that ability, it will be interesting to see how he communicates with his base in the coming days and weeks.\"\n\nTwitter cited two tweets by Trump that they interpreted as glorification of violence and a risk of inciting more violence. The first tweet read, \"The 75,000,000 great American Patriots who voted for me, AMERICA FIRST, and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, will have a GIANT VOICE long into the future.\" The second tweet read, \"These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long.\"\n\nThe ban could be seen favorably by the incoming Biden administration but also raises concerns about Big Tech's power. McGregor stated, \"Twitter's decision to ban Trump's account sets a precedent for future presidents and raises important questions about the role of social media companies in shaping our political discourse.\""}

Despite some Democratic support for recurring payments, slim majorities and a previous focus on limiting the third round of payments make further direct payments unlikely.\n\nLawmakers are now concentrating on a massive infrastructure bill and President Biden's American Families Plan, neither of which includes direct payments. The infrastructure bill, which could total over $2 trillion, is expected to focus on roads, bridges, broadband, and other physical infrastructure projects. The Families Plan, on the other hand, aims to expand social programs, including child care, education, and paid family leave.\n\nMeanwhile, the Internal Revenue Service is still making payment adjustments for those who lost income in 2020 and are due more from the third round of payments. These adjustments, known as \"plus-up\" payments, are automatically going to individuals whose 2020 tax returns show they qualified for more based on their income.\n\nThe expanded child tax credit payments, as part of the pandemic aid package passed in March, will begin on July 15. More than 36 million families are eligible for the child tax credit payments, which will be periodic. Eligible parents will receive up to $3,600 for each child under 6 and $3,000 for each child under 18, an increase from the previous maximum of $2,000.\n\nThe enhanced child tax credit will benefit single parents making up to $75,000 and joint filers making up to $150,000 a year. Additionally, the child tax credit has been made fully refundable, potentially benefiting 20 million more children.\n\n\"This is a vital step towards making sure that every kid in America gets the support they need to thrive,\" President Biden said during a recent press conference. \"No child in America should be left behind.\"\n\nThe child tax credit expansion is part of the American Rescue Plan Act, which also included the third round of stimulus checks and funding for vaccine distribution and small business aid. The legislation, which passed in March, was passed using budget reconciliation, allowing it to bypass a filibuster in the Senate and pass with a simple majority vote.\n\nDespite the success of the American Rescue Plan, the slim majorities in Congress and the focus on infrastructure and the Families Plan make it unlikely that another round of stimulus checks will be included in upcoming legislation. Some Democrats have expressed support for recurring payments, but it remains to be seen whether there is enough support to pass such a measure.\n\nIn the meantime, the child tax credit expansion is providing much-needed relief to millions of families across the country. The first payments are set to go out on July 15, with subsequent payments coming on the 15th of each month. For many families, this will be a crucial source of financial support as they navigate the ongoing economic challenges of the pandemic."}

While both these vaccines require two doses for full efficacy, the Johnson & Johnson (J&J) vaccine stands out with its single-dose advantage. Understanding the differences between these vaccines, their efficacy, and dosing schedules is crucial in navigating the ongoing vaccine rollout.\n\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines use messenger RNA (mRNA) technology to trigger an immune response against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. mRNA acts like a set of instructions that instructs the body's cells to produce a specific protein, in this case, a piece of the coronavirus. The immune system then recognizes these proteins as foreign invaders and produces an immune response. Initial immunity is observed after the first dose of both Pfizer-BioNTech (52-91% effective) and Moderna (50.8-92.1% effective) vaccines. However, full immunity from these vaccines typically takes around 2 weeks after the second dose. The second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is administered 3 weeks after the first, while Moderna's second dose comes 4 weeks after the first. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) allows the second dose to be administered up to 4 days earlier than recommended or up to 6 weeks (42 days) after the first dose in certain situations.\n\nThe discussions about delaying or eliminating the second dose to increase vaccine coverage have raised concerns about long-term immunity and variant emergence. The CDC does not recommend mixing Pfizer and Moderna vaccines; the same product should be used for both doses to ensure optimal immune response. Vaccine effectiveness is 95% for Pfizer-BioNTech and 94.1% for Moderna after the second dose. These high efficacy rates make it essential to prioritize the timely administration of the full recommended dosing schedule to protect as many people as possible against the virus and its potential variants."}

Pat Toomey (R-PA) for his vote to convict former President Donald Trump during the impeachment trial but stopped short of formally censuring him.\n\nThe vote, which came after a contentious and at times emotional debate among rank-and-file party members, showcased the strong influence Trump continues to wield over the GOP, as well as the party's ongoing struggle to reconcile its allegiance to the former president with the desire to present a unified front ahead of critical upcoming elections.\n\nMike McMullen, a GOP committeeman from Allegheny County, expressed his dissatisfaction with the decision, stating, \"We're sending a message that it's okay to defy the party and the constituents who elected you.\" McMullen hinted at targeting those opposed to censure in future party elections, saying, \"We'll remember those who didn't stand with Pat Toomey and the Republican Party.\"\n\nJohn McBlain, a State committee member from Delaware County and former county council member, countered, \"The focus should be on moving forward as a party and not dwelling on the past. Penalizing Sen. Toomey would be divisive and counterproductive.\"\n\nThe approved statement criticized Toomey for participating in what they called a partisan attempt at political retribution by Democrats. However, some members were dissatisfied with the lack of a formal censure, similar to actions taken in North Carolina and Louisiana.\n\nIn a narrowly decided 128-124 vote against censuring Toomey, with 13 abstentions, the party instead chose to censure four Pennsylvania Democrats for their handling of various matters. Democrats, meanwhile, responded by labeling the GOP as the party of Trump and extremism, inviting those disillusioned by the GOP to join them.\n\nThe process to address Toomey's impeachment vote had been ongoing for weeks, culminating in an online vote after technical difficulties delayed a previous attempt. The vote came as Republicans nationwide grapple with the fallout from the impeachment trial, which saw seven Republicans in the Senate join all Democrats in voting to convict Trump on a charge of incitement of insurrection.\n\nOne party member, who asked to remain anonymous due to the sensitive nature of the debate, expressed concern that the decision not to censure Toomey would embolden other Republicans to defy party leadership. \"If we don't hold our own accountable, what message does that send to the rest of the party?\" the member asked.\n\nToomey, who announced in October 2020 that he would not seek re-election, maintained that his vote was in line with his principles and his duty as a senator. In a statement after the vote, he reiterated his position, saying, \"I am proud to have represented the people of Pennsylvania for 18 years, and I will always put their interests above party politics.\"\n\nSome Republicans argued that censuring Toomey would set a dangerous precedent, potentially leading to a slippery slope of increased infighting within the party. \"We need to move past this and focus on the issues that matter to Pennsylvanians,\" said State Rep. Mike Reese (R-Westmoreland County).\n\nDespite the heated debate and the narrowly decided vote, both sides expressed a desire to move forward and present a unified front ahead of critical upcoming elections, including the May 18 primary and the November midterms. However, the lingering divisions within the party suggest that the road to unity may be long and arduous."}

The Duke and Duchess will participate in a 24-hour global broadcast aimed at promoting global vaccine equity to combat the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nGlobal Citizen Live is a groundbreaking campaign that calls on G7 countries and the European Union to donate 1 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses and waive vaccine intellectual property rights. The campaign also urges Pfizer, BioNTech, and Moderna to share their mRNA technology with the World Health Organization (WHO)-backed hub in South Africa to accelerate vaccine production and distribution.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex have a long-standing commitment to vaccine equity. They previously co-chaired the VAX LIVE event and wrote an open letter to Big Pharma, emphasizing that access to the vaccine should be a basic right and not limited by geography. In April 2021, they led a fundraising effort for Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, raising $3.5 million for COVAX to distribute vaccines to low-income countries.\n\nPrince Harry has been a vocal advocate for vaccine equity. In a recent interview, he stated, \"The vaccine must be recognized as a global public good, available and accessible to all, regardless of where you are from or how much money you have.\" This stance aligns with Global Citizen Live's mission to ensure equitable vaccine distribution and combat the ongoing issue of vaccine hoarding by wealthy nations.\n\nThe ongoing issue of vaccine equity becomes increasingly critical as coronavirus variants continue to spread and threaten the progress made in controlling the pandemic. Global Citizen Live aims to raise awareness and pressure wealthy nations to take action to address this pressing issue.\n\nThe Global Citizen Live event will feature appearances by health and global leaders, activists, and artists to promote environmental protection, poverty defeat, and vaccine equity. The lineup includes performances by Ed Sheeran, Billie Eilish, The Weeknd, and many more.\n\nBeyond vaccine equity, Global Citizen Live aims to address other pressing global issues. The campaign calls on wealthy nations to make a $6 billion contribution to tackle global hunger. It also encourages businesses to commit to emissions reduction and pressure G7 countries to increase their climate change commitments.\n\nGlobal Citizen Live is an extension of Global Citizen's long-standing mission to end extreme poverty by 2030. The organization uses the power of music, media, and technology to engage people and drive meaningful social change. The 24-hour broadcast aims to reach a global audience of billions, amplifying the message of vaccine equity, climate action, and poverty alleviation.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex have been strong supporters of Global Citizen's efforts. Their participation in the Global Citizen Live event underscores their commitment to creating a more equitable and sustainable world.

(AP) – A month after Hurricane Ida made landfall, communities along Louisiana's southeastern coast are still grappling with the aftermath of the Category 4 storm. In Ironton, a historically significant town founded by freed slaves in the 1800s, residents like Audrey Trufant Salvant are trying to pick up the pieces.\n\n\"It looks like a war zone,\" Trufant Salvant said, surveying the devastation around her. \"Homes have been unmoored, there's widespread flooding, and debris is everywhere. It's heartbreaking.\"\n\nMany residents, including Trufant Salvant, have been displaced due to the storm. Some are staying with relatives, others in hotels, and some have even left the state. The United Way of Southeast Louisiana reports a shortage of donations for necessary supplies like food, water, tarps, and cleaning products.\n\n\"We've seen an outpouring of support from the community, but the need is greater than what we've been able to provide,\" said Michael Williamson, head of the United Way of Southeast Louisiana. \"We're urging people to donate what they can to help those in need.\"\n\nFirefighter Warren Myers and his fiancée, Crystal Hagger, are among those struggling to obtain essential supplies for their family. Myers' daughter has special needs, and they require specific medical supplies that have been hard to come by due to the storm's aftermath.\n\n\"It's been a challenge,\" Myers said. \"We've had to go from pharmacy to pharmacy, trying to find what we need. It's frustrating, but we're doing the best we can.\"\n\nThe devastation from Ida surpasses that of Hurricane Katrina, according to affected residents. Justin and Lesley Landry, residents of Lafitte, lost their home to flooding and are hoping for grant funds to elevate it.\n\n\"Katrina was bad, but this is worse,\" Justin Landry said. \"We've been through storms before, but nothing like this. We just want to rebuild and get back to normal.\"\n\nRecovery efforts are being hampered by slow insurance assessments and the wait for federal assistance funds. Residents are growing increasingly frustrated as they try to navigate the complex process of rebuilding their homes and lives.\n\nDespite the severe devastation, long-time residents like Trufant Salvant express a strong emotional connection to their community and desire to rebuild.\n\n\"Ironton is more than just a town,\" Trufant Salvant said. \"It's a part of who we are. We'll get through this, together.\"\n\nAs the community comes together to rebuild, the road to recovery is long and arduous. But for residents like Trufant Salvant, the determination to reclaim normalcy remains steadfast.\n\n\"We'll get there,\" she said. \"It might take some time, but we'll get there.\"\n\nIn the meantime, the United Way of Southeast Louisiana and other organizations are urging people to donate what they can to help those in need.

Andrew Cuomo, who appeared on Chris Cuomo's CNN show several times during the crisis. Chris Cuomo had contracted COVID-19 in March 2020 and continued to anchor his show from quarantine.\n\n\"Chris wasn't working at the time, and he wasn't feeling well. He reached out for help in getting tested,\" a CNN spokesperson said in a statement. \"He followed all guidelines as officially advised to him by New York State contact tracers.\"\n\nRich Azzopardi, a spokesman for Gov. Andrew Cuomo, confirmed that the administration helped many people get tested early in the pandemic. \"When Chris got sick back in the spring, he was tested, as were many New Yorkers at the time who experienced symptoms,\" Azzopardi said in a statement.\n\nHowever, journalist Glenn Greenwald criticized Chris Cuomo's actions as an abuse of power. \"The idea that someone with significant power and influence, and the resources to get a special test, would use that power to obtain a test for themselves while millions of other Americans were unable to do so, is morally reprehensible,\" Greenwald said.\n\nCNN has since banned Andrew Cuomo from appearing on Chris Cuomo's show following the controversy.\n\nDespite the controversy, Chris Cuomo is currently off-air but is expected to return to his show next Monday.\n\nThe disclosure of Chris Cuomo's special testing comes as New York's governor has faced increased scrutiny over his handling of the pandemic in nursing homes and allegations of sexual harassment. Andrew Cuomo has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nThe New York Post first reported on Chris Cuomo's special COVID-19 testing. CNN did not respond to requests for comment from the AP.\n\nThe situation raises questions about the ethical implications of family connections and access to resources during a public health crisis. It also highlights the importance of transparency and accountability in media organizations.\n\n\"Journalists must hold themselves to the highest ethical standards, especially during times of crisis,\" said Kathleen Carroll, a former executive editor of the Associated Press. \"They must avoid even the appearance of conflicts of interest and maintain the trust of their audiences.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Chris Cuomo's special COVID-19 testing remains a topic of discussion and debate among media watchers and ethicists. Some argue that the incident was an isolated one, while others see it as a symptom of a larger problem within the media industry.\n\n\"This is a reminder that the media, like all institutions, is not immune from the corrupting influence of power and privilege,\" Greenwald said. \"It's up to journalists to resist that influence and report the truth, no matter how uncomfortable or inconvenient it may be.\"\n\nAs the situation unfolds, Chris Cuomo's return to his CNN show next Monday will be closely watched by media observers and the public. Whether he can regain the trust of his audience remains to be seen.\n\n\"Trust is a fragile thing in journalism,\" Carroll said. \"It takes a long time to build, but it can be lost in an instant. Chris Cuomo will need to work hard to rebuild that trust if he wants to continue his career in journalism.\"\n\nThe controversy over Chris Cuomo's special COVID-19 testing underscores the importance of transparency, accountability, and ethical standards in journalism. It also serves as a reminder of the challenges and complexities of reporting during a global health crisis.\n\n\"Journalists must remain committed to the truth, no matter what,\" Carroll said. \"They must be transparent about their sources and methods, and they must avoid even the appearance of conflicts of interest.

The tragedy has also led to involuntary manslaughter charges against Ethan's parents, James and Jennifer Crumbley. The couple pleaded not guilty during their arraignment on January 13, 2022.\n\nDavid Williams, Oakland County, Michigan, Chief Assistant Prosecutor, stated in a press conference, \"The evidence will show that the defendants, James and Jennifer Crumbley, knew their son was disturbed. They acknowledged his mental health issues, which were exacerbated by his fascination with violence and guns.\"\n\nAccording to the filing, Ethan's parents were aware of his depression but neglected his well-being. On the day of the shooting, Ethan created a drawing of a gun pointing at the words, \"The thoughts won't stop, help me.\" His parents were contacted by school officials about the disturbing drawing, but they did not remove Ethan from classes.\n\nWilliams continued, \"The Crumbleys failed to recognize the warning signs and failed to take any action to keep their son from harming himself or others. Their actions and inactions on the day of the shooting are inexplicable.\"\n\nProsecutors argue that the Crumbleys are flight risks, citing their financial troubles and a previous attempt to flee. In an affidavit, Williams wrote, \"The defendants have substantial financial resources, have previously attempted to flee, and may leave the jurisdiction if released prior to trial.\"\n\nEthan's parents reportedly bought him a gun just weeks before the shooting. Despite knowing about his mental health issues and his fascination with guns, the Crumbleys did not take appropriate measures to secure the weapon.\n\nAccording to the filing, Ethan had exhibited disturbing behavior prior to the shooting. He was \"sadder than usual,\" and had been torturing animals. Yet, his parents remained indifferent.\n\nDuring the arraignment, Williams criticized the Crumbleys for not being more vigilant on the day of the shooting, especially since they had bought Ethan a gun. \"Given their awareness of their son's mental health issues and his fascination with guns, the Crumbleys should have been vigilant on the day of the shooting. Instead, they failed to take any action to keep their son from harming himself or others,\" Williams stated.\n\nThe Crumbleys' lawyer, Shannon Smith, argued that her clients did not intentionally ignore their son's well-being. She stated, \"They are grieving parents who are devastated by the loss of their son and the tragedy that occurred at Oxford High School. They love their son and never intended for this to happen.\"\n\nThe prosecution also alleges that the Crumbleys were too consumed with their own lives to attend to Ethan's needs. The filing states, \"The defendants were consumed with their own lives and their own issues, leaving their son to fend for himself.\"\n\nThe school had a meeting with Ethan's parents about his mental state, but they did not remove him from school, allowing him to attend classes on the day of the shooting. Had they taken appropriate action, this tragedy may have been prevented.\n\nDavid Williams concluded, \"The evidence will show that the Crumbleys knew their son was disturbed and failed to take any action to keep him or others safe. Their actions, or lack thereof, contributed to this tragedy.\"\n\nThe preliminary examination for the Crumbleys is scheduled for February 1, 2022. Ethan's trial is set to begin on March 30, 2022.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Oxford High School shooting, the community is left to grapple with the loss of four young lives and seven injured students. The tragic event underscores the importance of recognizing and addressing mental health issues and the potential dangers of guns in the hands of troubled individuals.\n\nThe families of the victims, as well as the Oxford High School community, await the outcome of the legal proceedings, hoping for justice and closure.\n\nAs the investigation and legal proceedings continue, it is crucial that we remember the victims and their families in our thoughts and prayers. May their memories be a blessing, and may their loss serve as a reminder of the importance of addressing mental health issues and preventing gun violence in our schools and communities.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated as more information becomes available."}

In an interview, Nicholas Friedman, National Managing Partner and Governance, Risk and Compliance Strategist at Templar Shield Inc., shared his concerns, stating, \"The Colonial Pipeline incident is a stark reminder of the increasing risk of cyberattacks on critical infrastructure and their potential cascading effects.\"\n\nCybersecurity professionals warn that the interconnectedness of legacy assets and the rise of ransomware attacks pose significant risks to physical infrastructure shutdowns. Alex Bagwell, Vice President for Industrial Sales at Tripwire Inc., emphasized, \"With the increase in connected assets, we're seeing more potential entry points for cybercriminals. The risk of a ransomware attack crippling a pipeline or power grid is not a matter of if, but when.\"\n\nThe Colonial cyberattack significantly disrupted fuel supply on the East Coast, causing government action and uncertainty in fuel prices and supplies. U.S. Deputy National Security Advisor Anne Neuberger acknowledged the severity of the situation, stating, \"We're working closely with industry partners to prevent ransomware from moving from IT to operational technology (OT) systems, as we've seen in the Colonial Pipeline incident.\"\n\nIndustry experts advocate for better visibility and defense-in-depth strategies to respond more precisely to cyberattacks. Leo Simonovich, Vice President and Global Head of Industrial Cyber and Digital Security at Siemens Energy AG, emphasized, \"Companies need to understand their assets, implement multiple protection layers, and adopt a defense-in-depth strategy to effectively respond to cyberattacks.\"\n\nQuestions arise about Colonial's visibility into its systems and whether it could have taken a more targeted approach to the shutdown. Barbara Rembiesa, President and CEO of the International Association of IT Asset Managers, explained, \"Having a comprehensive inventory of IT and OT assets is crucial for effective threat detection and response. In the case of the Colonial Pipeline incident, it's unclear if they had the necessary visibility into their systems to take a more targeted approach to the shutdown.\"\n\nBest practices in cybersecurity involve multiple protection layers and network segmentation but are not foolproof. Johan Vermij, Research Analyst specializing in the internet of things at 451 Research, noted, \"While it's important for companies to implement best practices in cybersecurity, no solution is foolproof. The Colonial Pipeline incident underscores the need for a comprehensive approach to securing both IT and OT systems.\"\n\nThe incident sparked discussion on the need for more flexible policies and additional pipeline infrastructure for redundancy. Friedman commented, \"Given the increasing risk of cyberattacks on critical infrastructure, it's essential for policymakers and industry stakeholders to consider implementing more flexible policies and investing in additional pipeline infrastructure for redundancy.\"\n\nSecuring OT systems poses challenges due to their initial design and maintenance requirements. Simonovich explained, \"OT systems were designed with operational reliability in mind, not cybersecurity. This makes securing them a complex challenge that requires a deep understanding of both the technical and operational aspects of these systems.\"\n\nA comprehensive approach to OT security, including detailed asset inventories and business impact analysis, is essential for resilience. Rembiesa emphasized, \"To effectively secure OT systems, companies need to conduct thorough asset inventories, understand the business impact of a potential cyberattack, and implement robust security measures tailored to the unique requirements of these systems.\"\n\nConcluding Remarks: The Colonial Pipeline cyberattack serves as a wake-up call for industries and governments to prioritize cybersecurity and infrastructure resilience. As the interconnectedness of IT and OT systems continues to grow, so too will the risks and potential consequences of cyberattacks. By implementing best practices, investing in redundancy, and adopting a comprehensive approach to securing both IT and OT systems, organizations can better protect themselves against the growing threat of cyberattacks on critical infrastructure."}

The decision comes after a temporary freeze on Trump's account following the Capitol riot, during which viewers could still watch his past streams (Reuters, 2021).\n\nA Twitch spokesperson confirmed the ban, stating, \"President Trump's account has been indefinitely suspended for violations of our policies prohibiting hateful conduct and incitement of violence.\" (The Verge, 2021). This action ensures Trump cannot appeal the ban or create another account.\n\nTwitch's Community Guidelines strictly prohibit hateful conduct, harassment, or incitement of violence, and the company applies this policy to off-service events as well (Twitch, 2021). Twitch's decision to ban Trump follows similar moves by Twitter, Shopify, Snapchat, and Facebook, which suspended or permanently banned the former president's accounts in the aftermath of the Capitol siege.\n\nFacebook, in particular, has also indefinitely banned Trump, with COO Sheryl Sandberg commenting, \"We believe the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great\" (CNN, 2021). It is unlikely that Trump will be allowed back on the platform anytime soon.\n\nTrump's use of social media, including Twitter and other platforms, to promote election fraud theories has been cited as a contributing factor to the Capitol storming (CNN, 2021). Despite this, some politicians, such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar, have turned to gaming platforms like Twitch for digital messaging to younger audiences (Polygon, 2020).\n\nA spokesperson for Twitch added, \"We take reports of rule-breaking behavior seriously and take swift action when we find content that violates our policies. We trust our community to report any rule-breaking behavior they encounter, and we will take action when necessary\" (The Verge, 2021).\n\nThe ban on Trump's account marks a significant moment in the ongoing debate surrounding the role of social media platforms in shaping public discourse and enforcing community standards. As more politicians and public figures turn to digital platforms to engage with their audiences, the issue of how to balance free speech with safety and security will continue to be a pressing concern.\n\nReferences: CNN.

This comes after President Joe Biden tasked her with leading efforts to stem migration from Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries.\n\nHarris and her team are cognizant of the political implications of her new role. They fear being linked to the border situation, as criticism from Republican critics and the media has portrayed her immigration role as a border assignment. However, the Vice President remains committed to finding long-term solutions.\n\nOn June 7, Harris will embark on a trip to Guatemala and Mexico to discuss issues driving Central American migration to the US. During her visit, she aims to secure commitments from private companies to invest in the Northern Triangle countries, which have some of the highest crime rates and poverty levels in the world.\n\nOfficials and experts assert that addressing migration causes can't be separated from the situation at the US-Mexico border. The pandemic and economic downturn have exacerbated migration from Latin America to the US, with many seeking better opportunities or fleeing violence and instability.\n\nDespite the political challenges, Harris is keen on fulfilling her newly assigned task. She has engaged with immigration advocates and regional experts to gather a wide range of information on addressing the migration issue. The Vice President's role is particularly significant for the Democratic Party, as she is seen as a key figure for the 2024 presidential race.\n\nHarris's approach to the issue is multifaceted. She has pledged to increase humanitarian aid to Central American countries, as well as work with regional partners to address the root causes of migration, such as violence, poverty, and climate change.\n\nIn a call with Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei on May 25, Harris emphasized her commitment to strengthening the partnership between the US and Guatemala. She pledged to work together on issues such as economic development, security, and addressing the root causes of migration.\n\nThe Vice President's focus on addressing the root causes of migration is a departure from the previous administration's approach, which prioritized border security measures such as the construction of a wall along the US-Mexico border.\n\nHowever, the issue of migration remains politically charged, with Republicans accusing the Biden administration of being weak on border security. Some have criticized Harris for not visiting the border yet, despite her role in addressing the issue.\n\nHarris's team has argued that her focus on addressing the root causes of migration is the most effective way to address the issue in the long term. They point to the fact that the US cannot solve the problem alone and that cooperation with Central American countries is essential.\n\nDespite the challenges, Harris remains optimistic about the potential for progress. She has emphasized the importance of working with regional partners to find long-term solutions to the issue of migration.\n\nThe Vice President's trip to Guatemala and Mexico is just the beginning of her efforts to address the root causes of migration from Central America. It remains to be seen how effective her approach will be, but one thing is clear: the issue of migration is a complex one that requires a multifaceted solution.\n\nIn conclusion, Vice President Kamala Harris is focusing on addressing the root causes of migration from Central America, rather than managing the US southern border itself. She faces political challenges, but remains committed to finding long-term solutions to the issue. Her approach is multifaceted and includes increasing humanitarian aid, working with regional partners, and securing commitments from private companies to invest in the Northern Triangle countries. The pandemic and economic downturn have exacerbated migration from Latin America to the US, making the need for a comprehensive solution more urgent than ever."}

In a recent interview, Richards stated, \"Lin Wood and John Pierce were attempting to use Kyle for their own financial gain and personal agendas.\"\n\nOn November 19, 2021, a jury in Kenosha, Wisconsin, found Kyle Rittenhouse \"not guilty\" of all charges related to the shooting that occurred during a protest against police brutality. Rittenhouse was accused of killing two men and wounding another during the chaotic protests that erupted following the police shooting of Jacob Blake.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Wood and Pierce's involvement in Rittenhouse's case began with their fundraising efforts for his bail. Both attorneys raised significant funds, which drew criticism from various quarters, leading to demands for the return of the money.\n\nLin Wood, in response to Richards' accusations, claimed his fundraising efforts for Rittenhouse were legal. He also criticized Richards' remarks as baseless, stating, \"I have done nothing wrong. I have complied with all legal requirements. I have done nothing to harm Kyle Rittenhouse.\"\n\nJohn Pierce, too, defended his involvement in the case, describing the controversy over the bail money as a distraction meant to discredit him. In a statement, he said, \"The attacks on me and my team are a desperate attempt to divert attention from the facts of the case.\"\n\nBoth Wood and Pierce have previously been associated with promoting conspiracy theories and challenging President Joe Biden's 2020 victory through numerous election fraud lawsuits. In response to Richards' criticism, Wood doubled down on his stance, stating, \"Mark Richards is an embarrassment to the legal profession. He should be ashamed of himself.\"\n\nGOP Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene weighed in on the issue, criticizing Wood over the bail money controversy. Wood responded bizarrely, labeling Greene a \"communist.\" Greene, in turn, fired back, \"Lin Wood is a disgrace to the legal profession and an embarrassment to the Republican Party.\"\n\nThroughout his trial, Kyle Rittenhouse maintained that he acted in self-defense during the protest. The jury agreed, finding him not guilty on all counts, including intentional and reckless homicide. Rittenhouse's acquittal sparked intense reactions, with some hailing it as a victory for self-defense rights, while others decried it as a dangerous precedent.\n\nRegardless of the controversy surrounding Wood and Pierce's involvement in the case, Rittenhouse's trial has brought renewed attention to the issue of private fundraising for criminal defense and the potential conflicts of interest that may arise. The case continues to reverberate through the political and legal spheres, with both sides digging in their heels and refusing to back down.\n\nAs the dust settles on the Kyle Rittenhouse trial, it remains to be seen how this controversy will shape the future of fundraising for criminal defense and the role of celebrity lawyers in high-profile cases.

Eligibility and payment sizes vary based on previous stimulus qualification and the claiming of dependents. \"Californians can check their eligibility and estimate their payment using the MyFTB portal,\" Newsom added.\n\nIn addition to direct deposits, the Oct. 5 batch will include paper checks mailed to eligible residents. Those who have yet to receive their payments are encouraged to check their eligibility and update their banking information with the FTB to ensure a direct deposit in the future.\n\nNewsom emphasized the importance of this stimulus program in helping Californians weather the ongoing pandemic. \"These payments will put money directly into the pockets of those who need it most, providing a critical lifeline during these challenging times,\" he stated."}

(CBS 58) – Kyle Rittenhouse, the young man acquitted of all charges in the August 2020 Kenosha shootings, has remained a public figure since the verdict was announced a week ago. His post-trial decisions and interactions with media outlets have raised concerns from his legal team and legal experts.\n\nIn the aftermath of the verdict, Rittenhouse's attorney Mark Richards held a news conference but made it clear that he could not speak for Rittenhouse regarding media decisions. Richards stated, \"Kyle's going to make his own decisions about what he wants to do with his life. I can't speak for him. I'm just his attorney.\"\n\nControversy ensued when Fox News' Tucker Carlson announced an exclusive interview with Rittenhouse. The interaction was met with objection from Rittenhouse's legal team. Richards expressed disapproval of Rittenhouse allowing Carlson's film crew to follow him before the trial. Richards stated, \"I think it's premature for him to be making those kinds of decisions. I've advised him to be very careful about that.\"\n\nLegal expert Julius Kim commented on the implications of Rittenhouse's public appearances and statements for any future civil cases. Kim stated, \"He's free to do what he wants. But when you're in the public eye like that, there's always a risk that something you say could be used against you in any subsequent legal challenges.\"\n\nRittenhouse visited former President Donald Trump in Florida, continuing to maintain a high public profile. In advising Rittenhouse post-verdict, Richards emphasized the importance of taking responsibility and learning to refuse certain requests. Richards stated, \"I think it's important for him to understand that he has a responsibility to be accountable for his actions.\"\n\nKim highlighted the risks associated with making public statements that could be used against Rittenhouse in any subsequent legal challenges. Kim stated, \"He needs to be very careful about what he says and how it could be interpreted in the context of any future litigation.\"\n\nIf Rittenhouse profits from his notoriety, it may increase his chances of being targeted by lawsuits related to the events of August 25, 2020. Kim stated, \"There's always a risk of being sued when you're in the public eye like that. And if he's making money off of it, that could make him a more attractive target for potential plaintiffs.\"\n\nConcerns were raised about the implications of Rittenhouse's public appearances and statements for any future civil cases. Kim stated, \"It's important for him to understand that every word he says could potentially be used against him in a civil case. He needs to be very careful about what he says and how it could be interpreted in the context of any future litigation.\"\n\nRichards added, \"I've advised him to be very cautious about that. I think it's important for him to understand that his words and actions could have consequences.\"\n\nRittenhouse's legal team continues to advise him on how to navigate the public eye while avoiding potential legal pitfalls. Kim emphasized the importance of staying informed and seeking legal advice when faced with media requests and public appearances. Kim stated, \"It's important for anyone in a high-profile situation to seek the advice of legal counsel before making any public statements or appearances.\"\n\nIn conclusion, Kyle Rittenhouse's public life after acquittal has raised concerns from his legal team and legal experts about the implications of his media interactions and public statements for any future litigation. Rittenhouse and his legal team continue to navigate the public eye while staying informed and seeking legal advice to mitigate potential risks.\n\nMark Richards stated, \"I think it's important for him to understand that he has a responsibility to be accountable for his actions.\"\n\nJulius Kim added, \"It's important for him to understand that every word he says could potentially be used against him in a civil case.

Coale\n\nFormer U.S. President Donald J. Trump and his team have taken legal action against tech giants Facebook, Twitter, and Google (Alphabet Inc.), targeting their CEOs – Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey, and Sundar Pichai, respectively. The lawsuits demand the restoration of Trump's social media accounts and compensatory and punitive damages to prevent similar bans on other users.\n\nTrial attorney John P. Coale, who leads the legal effort, is no stranger to high-profile cases. In the late 1990s, he played a significant role in lawsuits against big tobacco companies, which led to multibillion-dollar settlements. Regarding Trump's social media ban, Coale stated, \"We are taking a stand for free speech and the right to participate in the digital public square.\"\n\nTrump's removal from Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube came in the wake of the January 6 Capitol riot. These tech platforms cited violations of their terms of service as justification for the bans. However, advocacy groups and the tech companies themselves have rejected Trump's claims, emphasizing the First Amendment's protection of media from government interference.\n\nSusan Wojcicki, YouTube's Chief Executive, released a statement following Trump's ban, saying, \"We have clear policies against incitement to violence, harassment, and hate speech. We consistently apply these policies, regardless of the speaker or their subscriber count.\"\n\nSteve DelBianco, CEO of NetChoice, a trade association representing tech firms, criticized Trump's action, stating, \"The First Amendment protects the media from government censorship, not private companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Google.\"\n\nTrump's lack of access to major social media platforms has impacted his online presence. While he has increased public activities, such as holding rallies and press conferences, his absence from these platforms has left a void in his ability to communicate directly with his supporters.\n\nCoale's lawsuits challenge Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, attempting to label social media companies as government actors. Section 230 provides immunity to internet platforms for content created by their users. Coale argues that by removing Trump's accounts, these companies have assumed a role similar to that of a government censor.\n\nA recent Florida law, which would have prevented social media platforms from banning political candidates, was recently blocked by a federal judge, adding another layer of complexity to Trump's legal battle. The judge ruled that the law violated the First Amendment.\n\nTrump's legal team is seeking a preliminary injunction to restore his social media accounts, arguing that the bans constitute a violation of his First Amendment rights. The outcome of this case could set a precedent for future legal challenges against social media companies and their content moderation practices.\n\nIn response to Trump's lawsuits, Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter, and Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, have yet to comment. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, has previously defended the company's decision to ban Trump, stating, \"The risk of allowing the President to continue to use our service is significantly outweighed by the risk of further incitement of violence.\"\n\nAs this legal battle unfolds, the implications for free speech, the role of social media companies, and the future of online discourse continue to evolve, keeping both legal and political circles on the edge of their seats."}

The attack completely paralyzed the brewery in El Prat de Llobregat for several hours.\n\n\"The production process at our El Prat de Llobregat brewery was affected by a cyber attack,\" Olga Vidal, Damm's head of communications, told Reuters, without disclosing if a ransom was demanded or paid to the hackers.\n\nThe brewery, which produces 7 million hectolitres of beer a year, was able to partially resume production with IT intervention. Damm, which makes several beer brands including the iconic Estrella Damm lager, has fulfilled all deliveries using existing stocks, Vidal added.\n\nThe attack comes amid increased scrutiny of security policies by governments and companies worldwide, following a series of high-profile cyber attacks. A European Union report released earlier this year highlighted the rise in cyber-criminal activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nRecent victims of ransomware attacks in Spain include the Autonomous University of Barcelona and Spain's employment agency, according to media reports.\n\n\"Cyber security is a top priority for us, and we are taking all necessary measures to address this situation,\" Vidal said.\n\nThe company notified the police about the attack, but the confirmation of the report is yet to be obtained.\n\nThe incident is a reminder of the growing threat posed by cyber attacks to critical infrastructure and businesses, particularly in the current climate where many organizations have had to adapt to remote working due to the pandemic.\n\nThe Spanish government's National Cybersecurity Institute (INCIBE) did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the incident.\n\nDamm is the latest in a series of high-profile victims of cyber attacks in Europe.

Venmo, the digital wallet service owned by PayPal, has introduced a \"Cash a Check\" feature, allowing select customers to cash their stimulus checks directly into their Venmo account.\n\nWith the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continuing, the timely access to stimulus funds has become crucial for many Americans. Venmo's new check-cashing feature provides an alternative to the traditional methods of receiving a paper check or waiting for a direct deposit.\n\nTo use the Venmo check-cashing feature, users need a verified email address, a Venmo debit card or active direct deposit, and location services enabled on their mobile device. The feature is currently available to a select group of Venmo users.\n\nVenmo has partnered with First Century Bank and Ingo Money to provide this service. First Century Bank acts as the issuer of the Venmo debit card, while Ingo Money handles the check cashing process. Venmo's parent company, PayPal, is also involved in this partnership.\n\nVenmo is waiving fees for cashing government stimulus checks through its \"Cash a Check\" feature, allowing users to access their stimulus money without a cut. This is a significant move to help those in need during these uncertain times.\n\nAfter waiving $400,000 in fees, Venmo's check-cashing feature will resume normal operations with usual fees. These fees vary based on the check amount and the chosen deposit speed. Users can choose between instant access to funds with a higher fee or a standard waiting period with a lower fee.\n\nTo get started with Venmo's check-cashing feature, users need to download the Venmo app, verify their account information, and use the app to take photos of the stimulus check. Venmo then conducts a review process to ensure the funds are available before depositing the check amount into the user's account.\n\nUsers can easily track and manage their stimulus payments through Venmo. The platform offers a clear overview of the payment status, deposit dates, and any associated fees. This transparency makes it easier for users to understand their financial situation during these challenging times.\n\nThe IRS Get My Payment tool is another resource for tracking stimulus payments. Users can visit IRS.gov and use their Social Security number, date of birth, and mailing address to check the status of their payment. This tool can also help users determine if they are eligible for a payment or need to provide additional information to the IRS.\n\nAs of now, the second stimulus payment is a one-time payment. However, there have been discussions about a potential third stimulus check. If another round of payments is approved, Venmo users can once again use the \"Cash a Check\" feature to access their funds quickly.\n\nThe Venmo \"Cash a Check\" feature is not only limited to stimulus checks. Users can also cash personal checks, pay bills, or send money to friends and family directly from the Venmo app. This versatility makes Venmo an essential tool for managing personal finances in the digital age.\n\nThe check-cashing feature is just one of the many ways Venmo is helping its users during the pandemic. In March 2020, Venmo waived fees for sending and receiving money to help people stay connected and support each other during these challenging times.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has brought about unprecedented changes to our daily lives, and the way we manage our finances is no exception. Venmo's \"Cash a Check\" feature, along with the waived fees for cashing government stimulus checks, is a testament to the company's commitment to helping its users navigate these uncertain times. As the situation continues to evolve, Venmo and other digital wallet services will likely continue to adapt and provide innovative solutions for managing personal finances in the digital age."}

In an episode of his podcast, \"Man in the Arena,\" Brady pondered the effects of the unexpected defeat, which came after the Patriots had completed the 2007 regular season with a perfect 16-0 record.\n\n\"Looking back on Super Bowl 42, it was definitely a heartbreaking experience,\" Brady shared on the podcast. \"We had worked so hard to get to that point, and to come up short was tough. I remember feeling heartbroken and sleepless for days after the game.\"\n\nBrady questioned if his desire to compete would have been different had the Patriots achieved a perfect season. \"I often wonder if the outcome would have been different if we had gone undefeated that year,\" he mused. \"But ultimately, I know that every experience, whether it's a win or a loss, teaches us something valuable.\"\n\nFollowing the loss, Brady vowed to himself to celebrate wholeheartedly if he ever won another Super Bowl. \"I learned that it's important to enjoy the journey and not just focus on the destination,\" he said. \"Winning a Super Bowl is an incredible feeling, and I wanted to experience that joy again.\"\n\nPost-2007, Brady went on to achieve additional Super Bowl victories, including a memorable win against the Seattle Seahawks in 2015. \"After Super Bowl 42, I was more determined than ever to get back to the big game and win it,\" Brady recalled. \"And with the help of my teammates and coaches, we were able to do just that.\"\n\nNow at age 44 and playing for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Brady secured his most recent Super Bowl championship earlier this year. \"Winning a Super Bowl at this stage of my career is a testament to the hard work and dedication that goes into being a professional athlete,\" he said. \"But more than that, it's a reminder that no matter what challenges come your way, you can always rise to the occasion and come out on top.\"\n\nBrady concluded the podcast episode by emphasizing the importance of learning from experiences, regardless of their outcome. \"Life is full of ups and downs, and it's how we respond to those challenges that defines us,\" he said. \"I'm grateful for every experience, good or bad, because they've all made me the person I am today.\"\n\nIn an interview with Sports Illustrated, Brady expanded on the impact of the Super Bowl 42 loss. \"It was a tough pill to swallow, but it made me stronger,\" he said. \"I learned that you can't control everything that happens in life, but you can control how you respond to it. And that's a valuable lesson, not just for football, but for life in general.\"\n\nBrady's teammate and fellow Super Bowl champion Rob Gronkowski echoed the sentiment. \"Tom is the ultimate competitor, and that loss only fueled his fire,\" Gronkowski said. \"He's always been driven to be the best, and that loss was a reminder that there's always room for improvement.\"\n\nBrady's former coach, Bill Belichick, who led the Patriots to 15 AFC East titles and six Super Bowl appearances during Brady's tenure, praised Brady's resilience. \"Tom is a tremendous competitor, and he's always bounced back from adversity,\" Belichick said. \"That loss in Super Bowl 42 was a tough one, but Tom used it as motivation to come back stronger than ever.\"\n\nBrady's former Patriots teammate, Wes Welker, who won three Super Bowl rings with Brady, agreed. \"Tom is the definition of a champion,\" Welker said. \"He's always been driven to be the best, and that loss only made him more determined to get back to the top.\"\n\nAs Brady looks back on his career, the Super Bowl 42 loss remains a defining moment. But rather than dwelling on the past, he's focused on the present and the future. \"I'm grateful for every experience, good or bad, because they've all made me the person I am today,\" Brady said. \"And I'm excited to see what the future holds.\""}

This incident underscored the importance of crisis management plans and highlighted the need for businesses to be prepared for unforeseen disruptions.\n\nAccording to Peter Deans, a risk and strategy consultant and the Founder of 52 Risks, \"The Suez Canal blockage was a wake-up call for businesses that have grown complacent about their supply chain risks. It's essential to have a detailed crisis management plan in place that includes goals, tasks, timeframes, required resources, and stakeholders to be notified.\"\n\nMark Dohnalek, President and CEO of Pivot International, echoed Deans' sentiments, adding, \"Companies should stress-test their recovery and contingency plans through simulations and exercises. This will help them identify potential weaknesses and address them before a crisis strikes.\"\n\nThe Suez Canal crisis resulted in significant delays, causing lost sales and increased supply and freight costs for numerous businesses. Dohnalek recommended, \"Sourcing from different routes and working with vendors that have operations globally can help companies avoid future crises and minimize the impact of disruptions.\"\n\nUsha Haley, W. Frank Barton Distinguished Chair in International Business at Wichita State University, emphasized the need for systemic redundancies, decentralization, and diversification in supply chains to prevent crises. She stated, \"Infrastructure choke points like the Suez Canal can cause significant disruptions. Government partnerships are crucial in addressing these issues and ensuring the resilience of global supply chains.\"\n\nAleksandar Tomic, Associate Dean for Strategy, Innovation, and Technology at Boston College, highlighted the importance of readiness for disruptions, maintaining higher inventories, and diversifying supplier bases. Tomic noted, \"Companies must be prepared for disruptions and have contingency plans in place. This includes maintaining sufficient inventory levels and working with multiple suppliers to minimize reliance on any single source.\"\n\nClear communication with customers is crucial, especially in complex situations affecting supply and demand. According to Deans, \"Transparency and open communication with customers are essential during crises. Companies must keep their customers informed about the situation and the steps being taken to mitigate its impact.\"\n\nDohnalek agreed, stating, \"Honesty and transparency are key when dealing with customers during a crisis. By keeping them informed, companies can build trust and maintain strong relationships.\"\n\nHaley added, \"Companies must also be proactive in addressing customer concerns and offering alternative solutions. This can help minimize the impact of the crisis on their business and reputation.\"\n\nTomic emphasized the importance of flexibility and adaptability in managing supply chain disruptions. He stated, \"Businesses must be agile and able to pivot quickly in response to changing circumstances. This includes being open to new suppliers, routes, and partnerships.\"\n\nDeans concluded, \"The Suez Canal blockage was a reminder that supply chain disruptions can happen at any time and can have significant consequences. By being prepared and having contingency plans in place, businesses can minimize the impact of these disruptions and maintain their competitive edge.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the Suez Canal crisis served as a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities in global supply chains and the importance of crisis management plans.

He had joined the Ferguson Police Department in 2015, following the shooting of Michael Brown, which sparked widespread protests.\n\nProtesting outside the Kenosha County Courthouse for three days, Kline brought a gun to the demonstration for a brief period. Kenosha County sheriff's deputies informed Kline he could not have the rifle near the courthouse due to its proximity to a school without a permit.\n\nKline voluntarily put away his rifle when informed of the Wisconsin law that prohibits knowingly possessing a firearm within 1,000 feet of a school's grounds. He continued to protest without the rifle, using a sound system to play music and a bullhorn, on subsequent days.\n\nKline claimed he traveled to Kenosha from Arizona for the demonstrations and described his current career as 'an investor.'

Brent crude also climbed 1.4% to $63.33, reaching a 13-month high, as freezing weather across the U.S. and Canada increased demand for power and fuel while posing a threat to oil production.\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service, over 150 million Americans are currently under some form of winter weather advisory. A major winter storm is predicted to bring heavy snow and significant ice across various regions, including the central and southern Plains, the Midwest, and the Northeast.\n\n\"The cold weather can have severe impacts on the oil industry,\" said Andy Lipow, President of Lipow Oil Associates. \"Frigid weather can lead to the shutting in of oil wells due to equipment freezing.\"\n\nThe cold conditions are expected to affect oil production in several regions, including Canada, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Texas, and elsewhere. In Canada, the cold weather is likely to impact oil sands production, while in the U.S., fracking operations in the Permian Basin could be disrupted.\n\n\"Oil production could be impacted for several days or even weeks, depending on the severity of the weather,\" Lipow added.\n\nThe ongoing winter storm may also lead refineries to slow operations and prepare for potential outages. Refineries in the Midwest and the Northeast are particularly vulnerable to power outages, which could disrupt their operations.\n\nMoreover, the steady rise in gasoline prices over the last week can be partly attributed to the storm. According to AAA, the national average price for a gallon of gasoline reached $3.31 on Tuesday, the highest since October 2014.\n\n\"The winter storm is causing disruptions in the supply chain, which is leading to higher prices for gasoline,\" Lipow explained. \"However, the impact on the overall oil market may be temporary, as the weather is expected to improve in the coming days.\"\n\nDespite the short-term price increase, Lipow remains optimistic about the long-term outlook for the oil market. \"The global economy is recovering, and demand for oil is expected to continue to grow,\" he said. \"Oil prices are likely to remain range-bound between $50 and $70 a barrel in the near term, but they could reach $80 a barrel by the end of the year.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the winter storm is having a significant impact on the oil market, driving up prices and disrupting production in several regions.

Boasberg of the U.S. District Court dismissed the FTC's initial lawsuit in June, deeming it \"legally insufficient\" due to the lack of specific factual allegations. Boasberg noted that \"the complaint does not plead that Facebook has monopoly power\" and does not contain sufficient evidence of anticompetitive conduct.\n\nResponding to these concerns, FTC Chair Lina Khan stated, \"The amended complaint overcomes the deficiencies identified by the court and sets out in detail the competitive harms caused by Facebook's anticompetitive conduct.\"\n\nFacebook, in turn, has criticized the FTC's ongoing legal action, asserting that its operations remain competitive and lawful. A Facebook spokesperson said, \"The FTC's revised complaint continues to rely on ideological prejudices, rather than evidence, to try to limit competition and disrupt innovation.\"\n\nThe FTC's request for FTC Chair Lina Khan's recusal from the lawsuit due to her past criticism of the company has been rejected. Khan, who has been a vocal critic of big tech's market power, has maintained her impartiality regarding the case.\n\nThe lawsuit, part of a broader government initiative targeting big tech's allegedly anticompetitive practices, could potentially lead to the breakup of Facebook, demanding separations like that of Instagram and WhatsApp to restore competition. Similar lawsuits against Google and potential probes into Amazon are also underway.\n\nThe amended FTC complaint argues that Facebook acquired Instagram and WhatsApp to eliminate potential competitors and maintain its monopoly in the social media market. It also alleges that Facebook has engaged in anticompetitive conduct by placing restrictions on app developers, preventing them from competing with Facebook's offerings.\n\nBoasberg's ruling on the amended complaint is expected in the coming months, and the outcome could set a precedent for the future of antitrust enforcement against big tech companies. Regardless of the outcome, the legal battle between the FTC and Facebook is likely to continue shaping the tech industry landscape for years to come."}

However, a Kaiser Family Foundation poll revealed that 44% of U.S. adults remain hesitant about getting vaccinated. As we approach herd immunity, experts stress the importance of addressing vaccine hesitancy and alleviating concerns regarding safety, efficacy, and potential side effects.\n\nMonica Gandhi, Professor of Medicine and Associate Division Chief of the Division of HIV, Infectious Diseases, and Global Medicine at the University of California San Francisco at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center, emphasizes the importance of getting vaccinated: \"The COVID-19 vaccines have undergone rigorous clinical trials and have been authorized for emergency use only after demonstrating strong safety and efficacy.\"\n\nMegan Ranney, Emergency Medicine Physician and Founding Director of the Brown-Lifespan Center for Digital Health at Brown University, adds: \"The benefits of the COVID-19 vaccines far outweigh the risks. Millions of people have been vaccinated without any major safety concerns.\"\n\nDespite these assurances, vaccine hesitancy persists due to concerns about new variants and potential side effects. Alessandro Sette, an immunologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology, explains, \"While new variants are a concern, the current vaccines are effective against the major ones. Ongoing monitoring and adjustments will be made as necessary.\"\n\nMatthew Frieman, Associate Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, emphasizes the importance of vaccines in reducing virus transmission, including asymptomatic transmission: \"Vaccines not only protect the individual but also contribute to herd immunity, which can help us return to normal activities.\"\n\nIndividuals who have had COVID-19 are still advised to get vaccinated for better protection. According to Gandhi, \"Even if you've had COVID-19, getting vaccinated provides an added layer of protection against new variants and potential reinfection.\"\n\nRegarding safety concerns, it is important to note that clinical trials and real-world data show vaccines are safe, with rare cases of anaphylaxis treatable with proper medical care. Ranney emphasizes, \"The risk of severe side effects from COVID-19 far outweighs the risk of side effects from the vaccine.\"\n\nScientists are optimistic that emerging variants can be managed and vaccines adjusted if necessary. Sette explains, \"The rapid development of new vaccines and technology allows us to adapt quickly to new variants. The scientific community is working tirelessly to ensure our vaccines remain effective.\"\n\nFrieman concludes, \"Vaccines, coupled with public health measures, are our best chance at ending the pandemic. It's crucial that we address vaccine hesitancy and encourage everyone to get vaccinated to protect themselves and their communities.\"\n\nIn conclusion, experts assure the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines amidst concerns about new variants and potential side effects. Vaccines not only protect individuals but also contribute to herd immunity and the eventual return to normal activities. It is crucial that we address vaccine hesitancy and encourage everyone to get vaccinated for the greater good."}

He died hours later from his injuries.\n\nHexum, an actor known for his work on the television series \"Cover Up,\" died on August 18, 1984, after shooting himself in the head with a prop gun during a break in filming. The gun was loaded with a blank cartridge containing gunpowder, and the force of the discharge caused the gunpowder to enter Hexum's bloodstream, leading to his death.\n\nThe film industry has been working to improve safety measures regarding the use of prop firearms since these tragic incidents. Despite these efforts, Thursday's incident serves as a grim reminder of the potential dangers that can still exist on set."}

The verdict has sparked a heated national debate over guns, vigilantism, and racial injustice in the United States.\n\nDefense attorney Mark Richards argued that Rittenhouse, then 17, acted in self-defense during the tumultuous protests in this Rust Belt city. \"My client was put in a position where he had to make a decision as to his survival,\" Richards said in his closing statement. \"He made that decision based on his training, based on the threats that were made to him, based on the conduct of other people that night.\"\n\nThe Rev.

The trial, known as PREVENT-19, was funded by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and enrolled 29,960 volunteers in the U.S. and Mexico. The study showed that the vaccine had an efficacy rate of 90.4% in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 infections.\n\nThe trial results were even more promising when it came to protection against moderate and severe disease. NVX-CoV2373 showed 100% efficacy in preventing these more severe cases of COVID-19. This is particularly significant as severe disease can lead to hospitalization and even death.\n\nThe vaccine also proved effective in high-risk individuals, including those aged 65 or older and those under 65 with certain comorbidities. NVX-CoV2373 showed an efficacy rate of 91.0% in this population. These findings are particularly important as older adults and those with underlying health conditions are at greater risk for severe disease and complications from COVID-19.\n\nThe most common side effects reported in the trial were mild-to-moderate injection site pain, fatigue, headache, and muscle pain, which lasted less than two days. These side effects are similar to those reported with other COVID-19 vaccines and are generally considered to be mild and short-lived.\n\nThe PREVENT-19 trial used a 2:1 ratio for vaccine to placebo distribution and maintained a study blind to ensure that participants and investigators did not know who received the vaccine. The study results were based on 77 symptomatic COVID-19 cases observed, with 63 in the placebo group and 14 in the vaccine group.\n\nNVX-CoV2373 uses recombinant protein nanoparticle technology and includes an adjuvant to enhance the immune response. This technology is different from the messenger RNA (mRNA) technology used in the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. In May 2021, the PREVENT-19 trial expanded to include adolescents aged 12-17. The COVID-19 Prevention Network (CoVPN) and various health organizations are involved in facilitating and overseeing the trial. With these promising results, NVX-CoV2373 is poised to become another valuable tool in the global fight against COVID-19."}

With the global population spending more time indoors due to lockdowns, online fraud has seen a significant increase, leaving consumers vulnerable to financial losses and identity theft.\n\nAccording to a study by British consumer group Which?, 34% of Google-reported scam ads were not removed, and 26% for Facebook-reported ads. This startling revelation has sparked accusations of a lax approach from Facebook, which prides itself on its community standards and commitment to user safety.\n\n\"Facebook has a responsibility to protect its users from scams and misleading ads,\" says Adam French, Consumer Rights Expert at Which?. \"It's concerning that so many ads reported as potentially fraudulent are not being taken down, leaving people at risk of financial loss or identity theft.\"\n\nScammers are taking advantage of the situation by creating fake ads using established brands' logos and branding to lure unsuspecting victims into parting with their financial details. Consumers are more likely to come across fraudulent ads on Facebook than on Google, with the study revealing that 58% of all scam ads were found on Facebook.\n\nGoogle spokesperson, when reached for comment, stated, \"We have strict policies against misleading and harmful content, and we remove ads that violate these policies. However, no system is perfect, and we're constantly working to improve and evolve our approach.\"\n\nFacebook, too, defended its stance, with a spokesperson asserting, \"We take the issue of scam ads seriously and invest heavily in systems and technology to detect and remove them. We remove millions of ads each week that violate our policies, and we continue to improve our systems to stay ahead of scammers.\"\n\nThe issue of online scams has gained significant attention in the UK, with consumers urging the government to take tougher action. The proposed Online Safety Bill in the UK could impose fines on tech companies failing to remove 'harmful' content, providing a potential solution to the problem.\n\n\"The Online Safety Bill is a step in the right direction,\" says French. \"It's crucial that tech companies are held accountable for the content they allow on their platforms, especially when it comes to scams and misleading ads.\"\n\nInsider previously reported on scammers using fake quotes from celebrities to promote fraudulent cryptocurrency schemes on YouTube. The pervasive nature of online scams underscores the need for increased vigilance and action from both consumers and tech companies.\n\nAs the digital landscape continues to evolve, so too must the strategies of scammers. Consumers must remain cautious and informed, while tech companies must invest in more robust systems to combat fraudulent activity. The stakes are high, and the consequences of inaction can be severe."}

The outage, which lasted from approximately 11:30 a.m. ET to just after 7 p.m. ET, came as an unwelcome surprise for Facebook, which reported earning an average of $319.6 million per day or $13.3 million per hour during the second quarter of 2021.\n\nFrances Haugen, a former product manager at Facebook, shared her perspective on the financial implications of the outage during a 60 Minutes interview, stating, \"When Facebook goes down, the world goes a little bit darker. It's not just about the revenue. It's about the impact on people's lives.\"\n\nThe financial loss for Facebook, while substantial, represents a minor impact in the context of its overall revenues. However, the outage was only the beginning of Facebook's troubles this week. On Tuesday, the company's stock fell about 4.9% following a whistleblower report accusing the company of choosing 'profit over safety.' Haugen, who came forward as the whistleblower, leaked internal Facebook research to the Wall Street Journal and lawmakers.\n\nHaugen claimed that Facebook deactivated safeguards against misinformation and offensive content after the 2020 U.S. presidential election. She linked the decision to deactivate these safeguards to the Jan. 6 Capitol Riots, asserting that the company prioritized profits over the well-being of its users and the safety of democratic institutions.\n\nIn response to the allegations, Facebook has minimized the significance of the leaked documents. A company spokesperson stated, \"The facts are clear: we've invested more than $13 billion and hired 35,000 people to help secure and protect our platforms from misuse.\" However, Haugen's revelations have brought renewed scrutiny to Facebook's business practices and its handling of misinformation and hate speech on its platforms.\n\nDuring the 60 Minutes interview, Haugen emphasized the importance of transparency and accountability in the tech industry, stating, \"We can't wait until there's a catastrophic event. We need to be able to trust by design.

The assault crippled the company's network, locking out users from over 3,000 servers and thousands of PCs, encrypting key areas of the IT infrastructure. The attack came on the same day that Hilde Merete Aasheim took the helm as Norsk Hydro's new CEO.\n\nCEO Aasheim recounted her first day on the job, stating, \"We were in the middle of a normal working day when suddenly, we were hit by a cyberattack. I was just getting to know the organization, and this was definitely not what I had anticipated.\"\n\nNorsk Hydro's Chief Information Officer (CIO), Jo De Vliegher, echoed Aasheim's sentiments, adding, \"We were faced with a difficult decision: pay the ransom demanded by the hackers or not. We chose not to pay.\"\n\nThe decision not to pay the ransom came with significant operational disruptions. Norsk Hydro's IT network was left in shambles, forcing the company to revert to manual processes. Production was maintained through pen and paper for about three weeks. \"It was a painful process,\" De Vliegher admitted. \"But we knew that giving in to the hackers' demands would set a dangerous precedent.\"\n\nThe ransomware attack is estimated to have caused Norsk Hydro an estimated loss of $70 million. Despite the financial strain, the company opted to work with cybersecurity experts and the Norwegian National Cyber Security Centre to recover from the attack.\n\nMicrosoft also lent its support to Norsk Hydro during the recovery process. Microsoft President Brad Smith expressed solidarity with the company, stating, \"We stand with Norsk Hydro during this difficult time. Cyberattacks like these are a threat to all organizations, regardless of size or industry.\"\n\nThe incident served as a major reevaluation of Norsk Hydro's cybersecurity measures and priorities. \"We are taking a hard look at our cybersecurity defenses,\" Aasheim said. \"This attack has shown us that we need to do more to protect our organization and our customers.\"\n\nThe U.S. Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) advised against paying ransoms in such situations. Eric Goldstein, Executive Assistant Director for Cybersecurity at CISA, stated, \"Paying the ransom only fuels the criminal economy. It's a short-term solution with long-term consequences.\"\n\nGoldstein's advice resonated with Aasheim and De Vliegher. \"We knew that giving in to the hackers' demands would only encourage more attacks in the future,\" Aasheim concluded. \"We stand firm in our decision not to pay the ransom, and we will continue to invest in our cybersecurity defenses to protect our organization and our customers.\"\n\nAs Norsk Hydro continues to recover from the attack, the company remains committed to its stance against ransomware payments. The incident serves as a reminder that the fight against cybercrime is an ongoing battle that requires a collective effort from organizations, governments, and cybersecurity experts."}

Witnesses Nina Celie Angelo and Matthew England, who were in town for a wedding, described the incident to FOX 13 News.\n\nAngelo and England, both residents of Utah, were having dinner at the Merry Piglets Tex-Mex restaurant on August 27, 2021. According to Angelo, they saw Laundrie and Petito get into an argument with the staff over a bill or money.\n\n\"[Laundrie] was being really aggressive,\" Angelo said. \"He was pounding on the counter. They wouldn't let him pay with a card, so he was insisting on paying with cash, and they didn't have change for a large bill.\"\n\nPetito reportedly apologized for Laundrie's behavior during the incident. England, concerned by Laundrie's demeanor, decided to report the incident to the FBI.\n\n\"[Laundrie] was really agitated, and she seemed visibly upset,\" England explained. \"So I just wanted to make sure everything was okay and that they were safe, and that was kind of the motivation behind calling it in.\"\n\nThe incident occurred just two days after Petito's final Instagram post and weeks after a domestic fight between the couple was reported in Moab, Utah. Bodycam footage from the Moab police response to that incident showed Petito in tears and Laundrie appearing calm. Petito later told police she was the one who instigated the altercation.\n\nThe couple's behavior at the restaurant and the Moab police bodycam footage were later used to identify them as the individuals seen arguing in the Merry Piglets video. Petito's disappearance followed soon after the restaurant incident, with her remains found later in a campsite north of Jackson Hole.\n\nBrian Laundrie returned home to North Port, Florida, without Petito on September 1. He retained a lawyer and refused to speak with police about her disappearance. According to North Port police spokesperson Josh Taylor, Laundrie's behavior upon his return was inconsistent with that of someone who had just reported a loved one missing.\n\n\"[Laundrie's] demeanor was not consistent with someone who had just reported a missing person,\" Taylor said. \"His response was not consistent with what we would have expected.\"\n\nAs the investigation into Petito's disappearance and Laundrie's involvement continues, the incident at the Merry Piglets restaurant remains a crucial piece of the puzzle. The witnesses' accounts provide valuable information about the couple's behavior in the days leading up to Petito's disappearance.\n\nAngelo and England's decision to report the altercation to the FBI shows the importance of speaking up when witnessing potentially dangerous situations. Their actions may have helped bring attention to the case and potentially contributed to the eventual discovery of Petito's remains.\n\n\"I just wanted to make sure everything was okay, and that was kind of the motivation behind calling it in,\" England said. \"It's a good reminder that if you see something, say something.\"\n\nAs the investigation into Petito's disappearance and Laundrie's involvement continues, FOX 13 News will continue to provide updates on the developing story.\n\nIf you have any information regarding Gabby Petito or Brian Laundrie, please contact the FBI at (303) 629-7171 or the North Port Police Department at (941) 429-7382.

He is a clear and present danger to the nation that we all love.\"\n\nRepublican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska became the first GOP senator to publicly call for Trump's resignation, saying the president \"has caused harm\" and \"betrayed his oath of office and betrayed the trust of the American people.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, discussed potential measures to prevent Trump from initiating military hostilities or accessing nuclear launch codes with Pelosi, according to a source familiar with the conversation. Milley's spokesman, Army Col. Dave Butler, declined to comment on the matter.\n\nWhite House spokesman Judd Deere criticized the impeachment efforts as divisive, telling reporters, \"The president's focus is on an orderly transition. He will leave office on January 20th.\"\n\nTrump, who has promised a smooth transfer of power, announced on Twitter that he would not attend Joe Biden's inauguration on January 20, marking a rare presidential snub.\n\nPelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., also discussed invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office, but this option seems unlikely given the lack of support from Trump's cabinet.\n\nDemocratic Reps. Adam Schiff of California and David Cicilline of Rhode Island introduced articles of impeachment accusing Trump of abuse of power related to the Capitol siege. A House vote on impeachment could occur as soon as Wednesday.\n\n\"The president's actions on January 6th were a betrayal of his oath to faithfully execute the laws and protect the Constitution,\" Schiff said in a statement. \"If these actions aren't worthy of impeachment, then nothing is.\"\n\nIndependent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination, tweeted his support for impeachment, saying, \"The President of the United States incited a violent insurrection against the United States government. He must be held accountable and removed from office.\"\n\nTrump's Twitter account was permanently suspended on Friday for violating the platform's policy against glorifying violence.\n\nPelosi reiterated her call for impeachment during a call with House Democrats on Monday. \"We can't allow the president of the United States to incite this kind of insurrection,\" she said, according to a source on the call.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump's allies have defended him, with some arguing that impeachment would only further divide the country. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has remained silent on the issue.\n\nTrump's second impeachment trial would begin in the Senate once he is no longer in office. However, some Democrats are pushing for a trial to begin before Biden's inauguration, with Schumer indicating that he would bring the articles of impeachment to the Senate floor as soon as possible."}

The name Lilibet is a touching tribute to Queen Elizabeth II, whose family nickname is Lilibet, and Diana, after Harry's late mother, Princess Diana. However, the choice to name their child after members of the royal family they have publicly accused of racism raises intriguing questions about their stance against the institution.\n\nIn their explosive interview with Oprah Winfrey in March 2021, Meghan and Harry detailed their struggles with racism within the Royal Family. They left the Royal Family citing racism, lack of support, and concerns over mental health. Their decision to name their daughter after the Queen, who they have accused of insensitivity towards Meghan's racial background, appears to be a contradictory move, sending mixed messages about their intentions.\n\nIs it possible for Harry and Meghan to reconcile their criticisms of the monarchy and its history of racial insensitivity with their personal connections to its members? The naming of their child after Queen Elizabeth II could be seen as a gesture of support to the royal family, despite their previous allegations. However, it may also come across as insincere or disingenuous to those who have experienced and continue to face racism within the institution.\n\nReal change against racism and the monarchy requires more than just personal reconciliation. It necessitates systemic reform and a genuine commitment to dismantling discriminatory structures and practices. The name Lilibet Diana does little to address the deep-rooted issues within the royal family and the monarchy as a whole.\n\nMeghan and Harry should not be considered heroes in the anti-racism movement based on their decision to name their child after the Queen. Their actions and public statements hold greater weight in shaping the narrative around racial equality and the monarchy. Naming their daughter after the monarch is a personal choice and should not overshadow their ongoing efforts to challenge the status quo.\n\nThe name Lilibet Diana carries symbolic meaning to Harry and Meghan, but it also raises complex questions about their relationship with the royal family and their commitment to addressing racism within the institution. The monarchy's history of racial insensitivity and discrimination is well-documented, and it is essential for Harry and Meghan to use their platform to bring about meaningful change.\n\nThe naming of their child after the Queen could be seen as a strategic move to maintain a tenuous connection to the royal family while continuing to criticize its practices. However, it may also serve as an opportunity for dialogue and understanding between the Sussexes and the royal family, potentially paving the way for positive change.\n\nUltimately, Meghan and Harry's choice to name their daughter Lilibet Diana underscores the intricacies of their relationship with the royal family and the monarchy. It serves as a reminder that anti-racism efforts require a multifaceted approach, encompassing both personal reconciliation and systemic change. The Sussexes' commitment to challenging racism within the monarchy will be closely watched, and their actions will play a significant role in shaping the future of the institution."}

The colossal vessel, operated by Evergreen Marine Corporation on behalf of the ship's owner, Shoei Kisen, is blocking one of the world's busiest commercial sea routes.\n\nThis is not the first time Evergreen Marine Corporation or Shoei Kisen have found themselves in the headlines for a maritime mishap. In January 1992, a ship under their management - the Ever Laurel - spilled an estimated 28,800 plastic toys into the Pacific Ocean during a storm.\n\nThe Ever Laurel, owned by Technomar Shipping, arrived in the port of Tacoma, Washington state, a day late from Hong Kong after encountering heavy storms. The incident resulted in the release of approximately 7,200 each of plastic red beavers, blue turtles, green frogs, and classic yellow rubber ducks into the ocean.\n\nDonovan Hohn's book 'Moby-Duck' chronicles the true story of the lost toys at sea and the ship's identity discovery through old shipping schedules. The captivating tale shed light on the unintended consequences of industrial shipping and the far-reaching impacts of seemingly insignificant objects.\n\nSince then, oceanographers have utilized the floating toys, known as friendly floatees, to track currents and gain insights into the world's climate. The toys have traveled more than 27,360 kilometers and have washed up on many far shores, inspiring curiosity and wonder.\n\nWhile the Ever Given currently blocks the Suez Canal, Evergreen Marine Corporation operates a different ship named the Ever Laurel. This Ever Laurel, built in 2012, travels between the Far East and South America.\n\nCargo ship spills are relatively common in stormy weather, with hundreds of containers lost from the One Apus in December 2020, north of Hawaii, as a recent example.\n\nMarine accidents, particularly those involving container spills, pose significant risks to marine ecosystems and human populations. The release of hazardous materials can harm marine life and disrupt food chains. Additionally, plastics can take hundreds of years to decompose, leading to long-term environmental damage.\n\nThe Ever Laurel toy spill serves as a stark reminder of the potential consequences of maritime transportation. While efforts have been made to mitigate the risks, including stricter shipping regulations and improved container securing methods, accidents can still occur.\n\nThe Suez Canal incident, though not involving a cargo spill, highlights the importance of maintaining a functioning global shipping network. The canal is a crucial link between Europe and Asia, with approximately 10% of global trade passing through it annually.\n\nThe Ever Given's grounding in the Suez Canal underscores the significance of efficient and secure shipping practices. Efforts to refloat the vessel continue, with experts working around the clock to minimize the impact on global commerce.\n\nAs the world awaits the resolution of the Suez Canal standstill, the story of the Ever Laurel and its plastic toy spill serves as a reminder of the interconnectedness of our global economy and the potential consequences of mishaps at sea.\n\nEfforts to clean up the plastic toys released during the Ever Laurel spill are ongoing. Organizations such as the Ocean Cleanup Project are working to remove marine debris from the world's oceans, reducing the risks to both marine life and human populations.\n\nThe tale of the Ever Laurel and its plastic toy spill is a testament to the resilience of nature and the ingenuity of humanity. As we continue to navigate the complexities of global commerce and maritime transportation, it serves as a reminder to remain vigilant and adaptable in the face of challenges."}

It was during this time that the Karnofsky family, Jewish immigrants from Russia, significantly influenced Armstrong and even gave him his first instrument.\n\nMorris Karnofsky, one of Armstrong's boyhood friends, later opened the city's first jazz record store on North Rampart Street, which Armstrong frequented.\n\nAccording to Baron, \"The Karnofskys saw potential in Armstrong and supported him in his early musical career. They even loaned him money to buy his first cornet, under the condition that he works for them for another year.\"\n\nArmstrong went on to become a jazz and popular music icon, known for his trumpet playing and singing. His influence on jazz and American music is still felt today.\n\nDespite the historical significance of the building, efforts to restore it as a city landmark have failed to materialize. A real estate firm, which had plans to restore the building as a homage to jazz history, now faces the challenge of rebuilding from the ground up.\n\n\"It's a reminder of the fragility of our history and the importance of preserving it,\" Baron said. \"We can only hope that the memory of the Karnofsky Tailor Shop and its influence on Louis Armstrong's career will live on.\"\n\nAs the city of New Orleans begins the long process of rebuilding after Hurricane Ida, the loss of this historic building is a reminder of the importance of preserving the past and the role it plays in shaping the future.\n\nThe music of Louis Armstrong continues to inspire generations, a testament to the enduring power of jazz and the resilience of the city and its people.\n\n\"Louis Armstrong's music is a beacon of hope and joy, even in the darkest of times,\" Baron said. \"It's a reminder that no matter what challenges we face, the power of music and the human spirit can help us overcome them.\"\n\nThe Karnofsky Tailor Shop may be gone, but the legacy of Louis Armstrong and the role the Karnofsky family played in his early career will live on in the hearts and minds of jazz fans around the world.\n\nIn the words of Louis Armstrong himself, \"Music is a language that doesn't speak in particular words. It speaks in emotions, and if it's in the bones, it's in the bones.\"\n\nDespite the loss of the Karnofsky Tailor Shop, the music of Louis Armstrong continues to speak to us in a language that transcends time and place.\n\nAs the city of New Orleans rebuilds, the memory of the Karnofsky Tailor Shop and its influence on jazz history will live on in the music of Louis Armstrong and the hearts and minds of jazz fans around the world."}

She stated, \"Understanding the long history of white violence against Black people is essential to addressing the root causes of these incidents.\"\n\nAshley Howard, an assistant professor of African American history at the University of Iowa, drew parallels between the trials and historical racial violence. \"The danger faced by Black Americans in predominantly white spaces has not diminished,\" Howard said. \"These cases serve as a reminder that the struggle for racial justice is far from over.\"\n\nWhite allies of Black liberation have also faced violence and vilification. In the 1960s, civil rights activists were met with violence from white mobs and law enforcement. Today, as the movement for racial equality gains momentum, there is a growing fear of diminishing white identity and power.\n\nCarol Anderson warned, \"White vigilantism is not just about individual acts of violence, but also about the societal norms and laws that enable and protect such actions.\" She continued, \"Until we address the systemic issues at the root of these incidents, we will continue to see the tragic consequences of racial injustice.\"\n\nMichael Waldman concluded, \"The Rittenhouse and Arbery cases are not isolated incidents.

They noticed a note on the van that read, \"Camping at Mcdonalds,\" which seemed unusual.\n\nA couple on TikTok claimed they picked up Laundrie hitchhiking near Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming, around the time when Petito went missing. The TikTok user, who wished to remain anonymous, described Laundrie as \"acting strange\" during their encounter.\n\nPetito's body was found in Bridger-Teton National Forest on September 19, 2021. The Teton County Coroner's Office determined her cause of death to be strangulation.\n\nRetired NYPD Detective Michael Alcazar, speaking to Fox News, highlighted the benefits of having millions of \"civilian investigators\" in the Petito case. He said, \"The more eyes, the more ears, the more people that are paying attention and are sharing information, it can only help.\"\n\nOn September 23, 2021, the FBI executed a search warrant at Laundrie's Florida home. Agents searched the property for several days.\n\nThe search and investigation into Gabby Petito's death are active and ongoing. The FBI is currently treating this as a homicide investigation.\n\nJenn Bethune, in an interview with Fox News, shared that they had provided potentially critical footage of Petito's van to the authorities. The footage showed the van's license plate number, which was later traced back to Laundrie.\n\nAnother TikTok user, named \"Fuzzonpop,\" claimed to have given Laundrie a ride on August 27, 2021, near the Spread Eagle Campground in Grand Teton National Park. This could provide important clues regarding Laundrie's whereabouts around the time of Petito's disappearance.\n\nSpeaking to CNN, Michael Alcazar said, \"The fact that social media was able to put the pieces of the puzzle together much faster than law enforcement, it just speaks volumes as to how powerful social media can be.\"\n\nThe Petito case highlights the power of social media in solving crimes. It also serves as a reminder of the importance of staying vigilant and sharing information that could potentially help in investigations.\n\nAs the investigation into Petito's death continues, law enforcement agencies and social media users remain committed to finding answers and bringing justice to Gabby Petito and her family.\n\nDetective Alcazar summed it up by saying, \"The power of social media is incredible.

The Suez Canal handles an average of $9.7 billion worth of cargo daily, making it a vital artery for international commerce.\n\nThe Ever Given's grounding has disrupted the transit of approximately 93 vessels daily, forcing nearly 300 vessels to wait in the Red Sea and the Mediterranean. The blockage comes at a time when the global supply chain is already strained due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Suez Canal is a critical trade route, accounting for about 12% of global maritime trade. The canal's importance is underlined by the fact that an average of 93 vessels pass through it daily.\n\nThe ship's owner, Shoei Kisen, has initiated efforts to free the Ever Given. These efforts include clearing sand and mud from the ship's propellers and hull, as well as using tugboats to reposition the vessel. The company hopes to have the ship refloated by Saturday.\n\nIn the meantime, some ships are being rerouted around Africa's southern tip, a longer, more dangerous, and costlier journey. This detour can add up to 10 days to a ship's voyage and significantly increase fuel costs.\n\nThe blockage in the Suez Canal exacerbates the already-strained global supply chain, which has been adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The disruption is expected to have cascading effects on industries worldwide, particularly those heavily reliant on imports from Asia."}

Their aunt, Ferishta, described their arrival as the \"best day of my life.\"\n\nFerishta, a US citizen, told CNN, \"Seeing them here, safe and alive, it's indescribable. It's the best day of my life.\"\n\nThe children's family had attempted to flee Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover but were separated during the ISIS-K attack at the airport. Their mother died as a result of the terrorist attack, and their father and older brother survived but were left behind.\n\nAhmad Faisal and Mina were evacuated to Germany with a neighbor before making their way to the US. They are currently unaware of their mother's death. Ferishta plans to inform them once they are settled with family in the US.\n\nRetired Air Force Lt. Gen. John Bradley, the founder and president of the Lamia Afghan Foundation, has been assisting Ferishta and her family since their arrival in the US. Bradley feels a sense of responsibility for the family's situation, as he provided them with documents that led them to the airport during the time of the attack.\n\n\"I feel responsible for their situation, as I provided them with documents to help them leave Afghanistan. I'm just relieved they're safe now,\" Bradley told CNN.\n\nBradley's foundation has been instrumental in helping Afghan families relocate to the US following the Taliban takeover. The organization has assisted more than 1,000 families since the fall of Kabul.\n\nEfforts are currently underway to reunite the entire family, including the father and other brother, in Virginia with Ferishta. The children's father has been granted a Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) and is expected to arrive in the US soon.\n\nFerishta shared her gratitude for the support her family has received, saying, \"We couldn't have made it here without the help of the Lamia Afghan Foundation and the US government. We're so grateful for their assistance.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Ahmad Faisal and Mina are receiving medical care and adjusting to their new life in the US. They are looking forward to being reunited with their family and starting a new chapter in their lives.\n\nFerishta added, \"They're just kids, they deserve a chance to live a normal life. I just want them to be happy and safe.\"\n\nThe children's journey from Afghanistan to the US has been a long and arduous one, but with the help of organizations like the Lamia Afghan Foundation and the support of their family, they are finally starting to heal.\n\nBradley emphasized the importance of continuing to help Afghan families in need, saying, \"There's still so much work to be done. We can't forget about the thousands of families who are still in Afghanistan, living in fear and uncertainty. We need to keep working to bring them to safety.\"\n\nAs the children settle into their new lives in the US, the focus now turns to reuniting the entire family and providing them with the support they need to rebuild their lives. The road ahead may be long, but with the help of organizations like the Lamia Afghan Foundation and the support of their loved ones, they are taking the first steps towards a brighter future.\n\nFerishta expressed her hope for the future, saying, \"I just want them to be happy and safe.

This dismal figure comes as President Joe Biden's approval rating also hits a new low at 38%.\n\nThe poll, which included a sample of 1,000 registered voters nationwide, reveals that a majority of 51% of respondents disapprove of the job Harris is doing as Vice President, while only 28% approve. These numbers represent a significant decline from her 48% approval rating in December 2021.\n\nThis early in a modern presidency, Harris' approval rating is unprecedentedly low. Former Vice President Dick Cheney, previously the most unpopular US vice president with a low of 30%, is slightly less unpopular than Harris at the same point in his tenure.\n\nHarris has been tasked with challenging assignments, including managing the migration surge of asylum seekers at the southern border, addressing inflation, and tackling climate change. Despite her efforts, her approval ratings continue to slide.\n\nAides to Harris are reportedly concerned about the 2024 presidential election and potential competition from former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has been mentioned as a potential Democratic contender.\n\nThe USA Today/Suffolk University poll is the latest in a series of surveys that have shown declining support for Harris. In January, a Quinnipiac University poll found her approval rating at 36%, while a Monmouth University poll put it at 37%.\n\nThe poll's results were published in a story by Business Insider, available exclusively to its subscribers. The margin of error for the poll is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\n\nHarris' approval rating has been impacted by several factors, including her handling of the border crisis, her role in the administration's COVID-19 response, and her perceived lack of visibility on key issues.\n\nDespite her low approval ratings, Harris remains committed to her role as Vice President and continues to work on the administration's priorities. However, her declining popularity could impact the Democratic Party's chances in the 2022 midterm elections and the 2024 presidential race.\n\nThe USA Today/Suffolk University poll is the latest indication of the challenges facing the Biden administration as it navigates a complex political landscape. Harris' low approval ratings add to the pressure on the White House to address key issues and boost public support."}

Forty-three Republican senators voted in favor of dismissing the case, with various explanations offered ranging from doubts about the House Managers' evidence to jurisdictional concerns.\n\nSen. Chris Coons (D-DE) acknowledged the outcome of the trial but stressed that further accountability for Trump could be pursued through other means. Coons stated, \"While the Senate has spoken, it does not exhaust the potential for accountability. This trial does not preclude criminal charges, civil lawsuits, and potential disqualification from holding federal office in the future.\"\n\nForty-three Republican senators explained their votes based on their beliefs that the House Managers had not proven their case or that the Senate lacked jurisdiction to try a former president. Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) stated, \"I believe impeachments are intended to remove officeholders from office, and I do not believe a Senate trial of a former President serves that constitutional purpose.\"\n\nHowever, it is technically incorrect to consider some of the 43 votes as a vote to 'acquit' based on questions of guilt or innocence. Instead, these votes were based on procedural and jurisdictional concerns.\n\nAn overwhelming majority of the 100 senators who considered guilt or innocence voted to convict, emphasizing the seriousness of the allegations against Trump. Despite this outcome, some of the 43 Republican senators' explanations might indicate their openness to future legislative actions against Trump. Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT), who voted to convict, acknowledged the importance of holding former officeholders accountable, stating, \"I believe that what was done was incitement to insurrection, and that the insurrection caused harm and danger to others.\"\n\nIn summary, the Senate's decision to acquit former President Trump on the impeachment charge of incitement of insurrection resulted in a mixed response from senators, with some emphasizing the importance of accountability and others expressing concerns about jurisdiction. The debate on Trump's future accountability is far from over."}

Rittenhouse's trial, which concluded on November 19, 2021, marked another instance where the criminal justice system failed to hold a white perpetrator accountable for the harm inflicted on Black lives.\n\nThe events that transpired in Kenosha, Wisconsin, followed the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, which sparked widespread protests against racial injustice and police brutality. In the chaotic night of August 25, 2020, Rittenhouse, armed with an AR-15 rifle, found himself at the heart of the unrest, claiming that he had come to protect property and businesses. However, as the events unfolded, Rittenhouse would end up taking three lives instead.\n\nRittenhouse's emotional testimony during the trial, which included tears and expressions of remorse, resonated with the jury, leading to his acquittal on all charges, including first-degree recklessly endangering safety, first-degree intentional homicide, first-degree reckless homicide, and attempted first-degree intentional homicide. The jury's acceptance of Rittenhouse's account, which was met with skepticism from many, raises questions about the validity of emotional appeals in trials and the role of race in the application of justice.\n\nIn the aftermath of the verdict, Rittenhouse was hailed as a hero among right-wing gun rights activists, with figures like Ted Nugent expressing their support for the young man. Rittenhouse's embrace by this faction underscores the political divide surrounding gun rights and the polarization of American society.\n\nComparisons between Rittenhouse's case and other incidents of violence against unarmed Black men are inescapable. For instance, the recent trial and conviction of the three white men who hunted and killed Ahmaud Arbery, an unarmed Black man in Georgia, offers a stark contrast to Rittenhouse's acquittal. The inconsistency in the application of justice in these cases further highlights the systemic racism that persists in our criminal justice system.\n\nRittenhouse's association with controversial figures like Matt Gaetz and Donald Trump also adds another layer of complexity to the situation. Gaetz, a Republican congressman, reportedly offered to pay for Rittenhouse's legal defense. Trump, who has been an outspoken defender of gun rights, praised Rittenhouse during a speech, saying, \"We're with him.\" These connections could pave the way for a future in political circles linked to Trump for Rittenhouse.\n\nHowever, the potential influence Trump might have on Rittenhouse's behavior, particularly towards women, is a cause for concern. Trump's treatment of women, which has been marred by numerous allegations of sexual misconduct, raises questions about the values that Rittenhouse, as a young adult, might adopt.\n\nIn conclusion, Kyle Rittenhouse's acquittal in the shooting deaths of two men during the Kenosha protests highlights the deeply ingrained issues of race and gun rights in America. The inconsistency in the application of justice between cases involving white perpetrators and unarmed Black victims is a stark reminder of the systemic racism that pervades our society. The glorification of Rittenhouse by right-wing gun rights activists and figures like Ted Nugent and Matt Gaetz, as well as the potential influence of Donald Trump, further complicates the situation. As we continue to grapple with these contentious issues, it is essential that we remain vigilant and committed to seeking justice for all, regardless of race or political affiliation."}

In an interview with Politico, Haley expressed her deep disappointment with Trump's attacks on former Vice President Mike Pence before the incident and predicted that Trump's political career is effectively over, regardless of the outcome of his second impeachment trial.\n\nHaley, a long-standing ally of Trump, stated, \"We need to acknowledge he let us down. He went down a path he shouldn't have, and we shouldn't have followed him, and we shouldn't have allowed him to use ourcapitol and ourcountry as a backdrop for the selfie.\"\n\nRegarding Trump's verbal assaults on Pence before the Capitol riot, Haley shared her disgust, stating, \"It was so wrong. I was appalled by it. I don't think he should have said it.\"\n\nPredicting Trump's political future, Haley asserted, \"I don't think he's going to run for federal office again. His influence is waning, and this [the Capitol riot] is going to follow him.\"\n\nThe interview revealed a significant shift in Haley's stance toward Trump, suggesting potential changes in her political approach if she runs for president in 2024. Previously, Haley had not publicly challenged Trump's false claims of election fraud. However, in the interview, she expressed her expectation that Trump would accept his defeat after legal challenges failed.\n\n\"I thought he would,\" Haley said. \"I thought he would see that the legal remedies didn't work, and then you have to put the country first and move forward.\"\n\nHaley emphasized the impact of Trump's words on his supporters and criticized his call for Pence to halt Biden's Electoral College certification. She stated, \"The president's words matter. They carried a lot of weight, and a lot of people took him seriously.\"\n\nHaley also expressed deep disappointment in Trump for betraying Pence's loyalty and friendship, stating, \"Mike Pence was one of his closest allies, and the way he treated him during that time was just wrong.\"\n\nDespite her critical stance on Trump's recent actions, Haley predicted that the impeachment trial would be a \"waste of time\" and believed Trump would face isolation and business losses. Tim Alberta, a Politico senior writer, suggests that Haley is prepping for a 2024 presidential run based on her actions and interviews with people who know her.\n\n\"She's doing a lot of the things you do when you're thinking about running for president,\" Alberta said."}

As of May 10, the company's main lines remain non-operational, while some smaller lines are functioning. Colonial Pipeline, which transports critical fuels such as gasoline, diesel, heating oil, and jet fuel to the southeastern United States, is working to restore service by the end of the week.\n\nThe disruption of the Colonial Pipeline has forced the southeastern U.S. to rely on inventory and alternative sources to meet fuel demand. One such alternative source is the 720,000 b/d Products (SE) Pipeline, which runs parallel to the Colonial Pipeline and can help alleviate some of the supply concerns. However, pipeline flow is slow, meaning that some areas may depend on inventories for days post-restoration. Atlantic Coast markets have options for imports and marine shipments for additional supplies, while central Atlantic and Northeast markets can import fuel from Europe, Canada, or use in-region refineries.\n\nRegulatory waivers have been issued to ease trucking restrictions for petroleum product delivery across 17 states and Washington, D.C., in response to the pipeline disruption. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) granted the waivers to ensure that essential supplies reach their destinations in a timely and efficient manner. The waivers will remain in effect until further notice.\n\nThe Colonial Pipeline cyberattack has highlighted the importance of energy infrastructure security and the potential consequences of disruptions. As the pipeline works to restore service and the southeastern U.S. adapts to the situation, the incident serves as a reminder of the interconnected nature of the energy sector and the need for robust cybersecurity measures to protect critical infrastructure. The situation is ongoing, and updates will be provided as more information becomes available."}

The suspension came as a response to a series of tweets from Trump, which included misinformation about the election results and messages that were perceived as encouraging his supporters.\n\nTrump's Twitter account had long been a source of controversy, with the president frequently using the platform for policy announcements, public scorn, and spreading misinformation. However, the social media giant took action when Trump's tweets during the Capitol riot crossed the line, leading to the tragic loss of lives and the disruption of the democratic process.\n\nFacebook and Instagram, owned by the same parent company, also indefinitely suspended Trump's accounts through at least January 20, 2021. The suspension of Trump's accounts on multiple social media platforms marked a unprecedented moment in digital history.\n\nTrump's controversial tweets during the Capitol riot involved spreading misinformation about the election results and praising the mob as \"loved\" and \"special.\" In response to these tweets, Twitter initially locked Trump's messages from the riot day, restricting interaction and preventing them from being retweeted or liked.\n\nIn his final tweets before the suspension, Trump praised his voters and announced that he would not attend Joe Biden's inauguration. Trump has since criticized Twitter's actions as censorship and called for the repeal of Section 230, a law that protects social media companies from being held liable for content posted by their users.\n\nTrump's use of Twitter had been a defining feature of his presidency, with the platform allowing him to bypass traditional media outlets and connect directly with his supporters. However, Twitter started flagging Trump's tweets for misinformation in 2020, regarding elections and COVID-19, leading up to the permanent suspension.\n\nA federal appeals court previously ruled that Trump's Twitter account held official public statements, making banning users unconstitutional. However, the permanent suspension of Trump's Twitter account sets a new precedent in the ongoing debate over digital censorship and the role of social media companies in regulating content."}

Acting Deputy Director of the NHC, Jamie Rhome, warned, \"This storm will bring a dangerous storm surge, dangerous winds, and heavy rainfall.\"\n\nGovernor John Bel Edwards of Louisiana urged residents in the path of the storm to take immediate action, stating, \"Ida is a dangerous storm, and preparation time is rapidly closing.\" Edwards has issued both voluntary and mandatory evacuation orders across the region, including in New Orleans, where traffic was heavy on Saturday and most filling stations were out of petrol.\n\nMike Laurent, a resident of Marrero, Louisiana, shared his concerns, \"We've been through this before, but Ida seems different. We're stocking up on supplies and preparing as best we can.\" Jeff Masters, meteorologist and founder of Weather Underground, echoed Laurent's sentiments, \"Ida is forecasted to be more severe than Hurricane Katrina, which hit the same area 16 years ago.\"\n\nThe storm's path through the industrial corridor between New Orleans and Baton Rouge is particularly concerning due to the concentration of critical infrastructure there. Edwards emphasized, \"The impact on our energy infrastructure could be significant and far-reaching.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden held a conference call with governors and emergency response officials to prepare for Ida's landfall. Biden pledged, \"We're going to make sure that the federal government is providing every possible resource to help our state and local partners respond to this storm.\"\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has deployed 500 federal emergency response workers to Texas and Louisiana to respond to the storm, with plans to restore power as soon as possible.

The trial is scheduled to start on November 1.\n\nDuring the hearing, prosecutors revealed they have infrared video from an FBI airplane purportedly showing Rittenhouse chasing his first victim, Joseph Rosenbaum, the night of the shooting.\n\n\"We've obtained an infrared video from an FBI airplane that shows Mr. Rittenhouse chasing Mr. Rosenbaum through the streets of Kenosha,\" Binger disclosed.\n\nJudge Schroeder has yet to decide on whether potential jurors will be asked to fill out questionnaires before selection. He stressed during the hearing that the trial is not to be political and expressed concerns over questionnaire content.\n\n\"I'm not going to have a political trial,\" Schroeder asserted. \"I'm not going to have a trial that turns into a referendum on Antifa or BLM.\"\n\nThe judge also withheld a final ruling on introducing an incident of Rittenhouse expressing a desire to use a rifle against perceived looters in a social media post.\n\nRichards argued that the statement was relevant to Rittenhouse's state of mind. \"It shows that he was fearful of what was happening in Kenosha,\" the defense attorney stated.\n\nBinger countered that the statement was not relevant to the actual events of the shooting. \"There's no evidence that Mr. Rittenhouse's state of mind was such that he was justified in using deadly force against these individuals,\" Binger argued.\n\nA motion to dismiss a misdemeanor charge of Rittenhouse possessing a firearm as a minor has yet to be ruled on. Richards argued that the charge should be dismissed because Rittenhouse was acting as a private citizen, not a law enforcement officer.\n\n\"Mr. Rittenhouse is not a peace officer,\" Richards asserted. \"He's not a law enforcement officer. He's a citizen.\"\n\nBinger countered that the minor in possession law applies regardless of whether Rittenhouse was acting as a peace officer or not. \"The statute doesn't make an exception for citizens,\" Binger argued.\n\nThe pre-trial hearings are expected to continue in the coming weeks as the November 1 trial date approaches."}

No one should rely solely on the armorer or the prop master.\"\n\nBrandon Lee's fiancée at the time of his death, Eliza Hutton, shares her sympathy for the Hutchins family and echoes Lee's sentiments about the need for improved gun safety measures on film sets.\n\nQuote from Eliza Hutton: \"Another avoidable tragedy. My heart goes out to Halyna's family, friends, and colleagues. Brandon and I lived through a similar nightmare 28 years ago.\"\n\nThe film industry has been under scrutiny in recent years for its handling of gun safety on sets. Hutton believes that it's time for the industry to consider alternatives to using real guns on sets.\n\nQuote from Eliza Hutton: \"It's 2021. Surely there are better, safer ways to create the illusion of gunfire.\"\n\nAlec Baldwin, the actor involved in the fatal shooting on the \"Rust\" set, has reached out to Hutchins' family to express his condolences and concern.\n\nQuote from Alec Baldwin: \"There are no words to convey my shock and sadness regarding the tragic accident that took the life of Halyna Hutchins, a wife, mother, and deeply admired colleague. I'm fully cooperating with the police investigation to address how this tragedy occurred and I am in touch with her husband, offering my support to him and his family.\"\n\nThe incident occurred on October 21 during a rehearsal on the \"Rust\" set when a gun, believed to be safe and loaded with blanks, contained real bullets.\n\nThe investigation into the incident is ongoing, with no charges filed yet but authorities are keeping \"all options on the table.\"\n\nQuote from Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza: \"We're going to leave no stone unturned. We're going to follow the facts and evidence wherever they take us.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of the tragedy, the \"Rust\" production has been halted indefinitely.\n\nGun safety on film sets has long been a contentious issue. In the wake of Brandon Lee's death, the film industry adopted stricter gun safety protocols, but it appears that more needs to be done.\n\nQuote from Shannon Lee: \"We can't let history repeat itself. We need to learn from the past and make real changes.\"\n\nThe film industry has faced criticism for its handling of gun safety on sets, with some claiming that the pressure to maintain production schedules can lead to shortcuts in safety procedures.\n\nQuote from Eliza Hutton: \"Safety should always be the top priority. We can't afford to compromise on that.\"\n\nThe tragedy on the \"Rust\" set has brought renewed attention to the issue of gun safety on film sets, and many in the industry are calling for mandatory gun safety training for all cast and crew members who handle firearms.\n\nAs the investigation into the \"Rust\" incident continues, the film industry faces a critical moment in which it must reassess its approach to gun safety on sets and make the necessary changes to prevent future tragedies.\n\nQuote from Shannon Lee: \"We owe it to Halyna, Brandon, and all those who have lost their lives to ensure that no one else has to go through this pain.

In addition, all comments have been disabled on Trump's channel indefinitely.\n\n\"Given the ongoing concerns about violence, we have taken the unusual step of suspending the Donald J. Trump channel for at least the next seven days,\" a YouTube spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nTrump was permanently banned on Twitter on January 8, 2021, following the storming of the U.S. Capitol building on January 6. Facebook has also banned Trump at least until President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration on January 20.\n\nJim Steyer, CEO of Common Sense Media, a nonprofit organization advocating for kids and families, called YouTube's action an \"important and necessary first step.\"\n\n\"YouTube's decision to suspend President Trump's account is an important and necessary first step to help prevent further incitement of violence and the spread of misinformation on their platform,\" Steyer said in a statement. \"But it's not enough. This suspension should be permanent. And YouTube must do more to protect children and families from harmful and dangerous content.\"\n\nGoogle, YouTube's parent company, announced a pause on political ads on its platforms until after Inauguration Day to prevent the spread of misinformation and exploitation of the Capitol siege. The move came after Twitter and Facebook suspended political ads leading up to the election.\n\nMeanwhile, Parler, the social media platform favored by some conservatives, registered its domain with Epik, a domain registrar known for hosting far-right services, after being removed by Amazon Web Services and app stores. Parler is suing Amazon for alleged antitrust violations over its expulsion.\n\n\"Amazon's selective enforcement of its terms of service is anticompetitive acts that amount to monopolistic abuse under Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act,\" Parler's complaint reads.\n\nOther tech companies have taken action against misinformation related to the Capitol riot. Twitter suspended more than 70,000 accounts and removed over 500 tweets that violated its rules. Facebook and Instagram removed posts that contained false claims about the election results and the Capitol siege.\n\nIn other tech news, Apple announced new projects related to its $100 million pledge for racial equity and justice.

Both companies suspended Trump's accounts, marking the most aggressive measures taken against him to date.\n\nTwitter locked Trump's account for 12 hours on January 8, 2021, and required the removal of three of his tweets that were deemed to be in violation of the company's policy against glorifying violence. In a statement, Twitter said, \"After close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around them — specifically how they are being received and interpreted on and off Twitter — we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence.\"\n\nFacebook and Instagram (owned by Facebook) followed suit, announcing a 24-hour suspension of Trump's account due to policy violations. Guy Rosen, Facebook's vice-president of integrity, stated, \"The violent protests in the Capitol today are a shocking and desperate attempt to distort the democratic process, and we prohibit attempts to incite violent or dangerous behavior.\"\n\nExperts argue that the social media platforms' actions were too little, too late, given Trump's repeated use of social media to spread misinformation and incite violence. Jennifer Grygiel, a communications professor at Syracuse University, stated, \"Social media companies have known for a long time that Trump has been using their platforms to spread propaganda and disinformation. They had a responsibility to act much earlier than they did.\"\n\nGrygiel continued, \"Social media companies have a responsibility to protect their users from harm, and allowing Trump to continue using their platforms to incite violence and spread misinformation was a clear violation of that responsibility.\"\n\nThe incident interrupts the confirmation of electoral college results and President-elect Joe Biden's victory. Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive officer of the Anti-Defamation League, called for Trump's permanent ban from social media platforms, stating, \"President Trump has used social media to incite violence and spread hate, and it's long past time for these companies to take decisive action to protect their users and the democratic process.\"\n\nIn a statement, Trump acknowledged defeat and assured an \"orderly transition on January 20th.\" The statement was posted by his aides, as Trump's Twitter account remained suspended.\n\nCritics, including the Anti-Defamation League, called for Trump's permanent ban from social media platforms, arguing that the temporary suspensions were not enough to prevent further harm.\n\nThe suspensions come after weeks of pressure on social media companies to take action against Trump's posts, which were deemed to be in violation of the companies' policies on hate speech, misinformation, and incitement to violence.\n\nThe suspensions mark a turning point in the relationship between social media companies and political leaders, and raise questions about the role of social media in the democratic process and the responsibility of tech companies to regulate content on their platforms. As Guy Rosen stated, \"We believe the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great.\""}

The Arkansas Blood Institute, in a misguided attempt to show solidarity, organized a blood drive at the Bass Pro Shops parking lot, a popular gun store that sells firearms similar to the one used in the Michigan shooting. The juxtaposition of saving lives through blood donations and the potential sale of weapons capable of taking them was a stark reminder of the complexities of gun violence in America.\n\nThe press release announcing the blood drive stated, \"Amidst ironic circumstances, the Arkansas Blood Institute invites you to donate blood and help save lives at Bass Pro Shops.\" The good intentions were clear, but the question of the proximity of blood donation to potential gun purchases at the same location left many with a bitter taste.\n\nThe Michigan shooter, a 15-year-old boy, had obtained the weapon used in the shooting through illegal means. This tragic incident underscored the need for stricter gun control measures but also highlighted the troubling coexistence of life-saving efforts and the sale of deadly weapons.\n\nThe National Rifle Association (NRA) and its political allies continue to wield significant influence, preventing meaningful gun safety legislation from being enacted. Despite the growing number of mass shootings and gun violence incidents, the NRA's grip on lawmakers remains unyielding, leaving many to question the true priorities of their elected officials.\n\nAs the body count from gun violence continues to mount, it's important to examine the effectiveness of gestures like blood drives in combatting the issue. While these efforts can save lives in the short term, they do little to address the root causes of gun violence and the easy accessibility of deadly weapons.\n\nThe Bass Pro Shops blood drive was a microcosm of the larger issue. By hosting the event at a gun store, the Arkansas Blood Institute unintentionally perpetuated the normalization of guns and violence in American culture.\n\nAccording to the Gun Violence Archive, there have been over 150 mass shootings in the United States this year. These numbers are unacceptable, and it's time for action. We need comprehensive background checks, red flag laws, and bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.\n\nIt's crucial that we hold our elected officials accountable for their inaction on gun control. They must prioritize the safety and wellbeing of their constituents over the interests of the NRA and gun manufacturers.\n\nThe Michigan shooter's access to a deadly weapon should serve as a wake-up call. We cannot continue to ignore the signs and allow gun violence to become the new norm. It's time for bold action and a meaningful conversation about gun safety.\n\nAs we move forward, let us remember the victims of gun violence and their families. Let us honor their memories by demanding change and working towards a future where blood drives are not held in the shadows of gun stores. Let us come together and fight for common-sense gun legislation that will save lives and protect our communities."}

This financial blunder, the result of a user-interface error during a transaction setup, has left Citibank scrambling to reclaim the funds, but to no avail.\n\nVincent Fratta, a senior manager at Citibank, shared his dismay over the incident, stating, \"We were shocked and disappointed when we discovered the error. We immediately reached out to the lenders to rectify the situation.\"\n\nThe error transpired on August 11, 2021, during a routine transaction meant to distribute $7.8 million in interest payments to the 315 creditors holding Revlon's senior debt. However, a Wipro employee's oversight led to the accidental repayment of the entire $894 million principal.\n\nDespite the presence of a \"six-eyes\" policy, which involves a Wipro worker in India, a local manager, and Citibank's Vincent Fratta, the error went unnoticed. The policy is designed to ensure the accuracy and completeness of financial transactions.\n\nBenjamin Finestone, a lawyer representing Brigade and HPS Investment Partners, two of the lenders who received the mistaken funds, expressed satisfaction with the outcome. He stated, \"Our clients acted reasonably in considering the payment as intentional, given that it was made in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement.\"\n\nThe mistake repaid the entire loan principal to the lenders earlier than the due date in 2023, leaving Citibank in a precarious position. In a surprising turn of events, a US federal district court judge sided with the lenders, denying Citibank's request to recover the funds.\n\nJudge Jesse Furman, who presided over the case, ruled that Citibank had failed to demonstrate that the lenders had acted unreasonably in retaining the funds. He further stated, \"Believing that Citibank made such a mistake is borderline irrational.\"\n\nFrustrated by the decision, Citibank has announced its intention to appeal the decision. In a statement, the bank expressed its determination to recover the mistakenly sent funds, stating, \"We remain committed to pursuing all available legal remedies to rectify this situation.\"\n\nDespite the setback, Citibank's legal team remains optimistic about their chances of reversing the decision. They argue that the lenders had a duty to return the funds once they became aware of the error, and that Citibank's mistake should not absolve them of this responsibility.\n\nIn the meantime, the lenders have reportedly deposited the funds in an escrow account, awaiting the outcome of the appeal. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of robust financial controls and the potential consequences of human error in complex financial transactions."}

The latest wave of attacks, which began in March 2021, primarily targeted organizations in the United States and those involved in international development, humanitarian, and human rights work.\n\nThe attacks were initiated through an email marketing account of the United States Agency For International Development (USAID). The hackers used spear-phishing emails to infiltrate the organizations' networks, deploying malware to gain access to sensitive information.\n\nBoth the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and USAID are actively investigating the hacking incidents. The DHS has issued a warning about the ongoing attacks, urging organizations to be vigilant and take appropriate measures to secure their networks.\n\nNobelium's involvement in the recent attacks comes as no surprise, as the group was previously linked to the 2020 SolarWinds cyber attack. The SolarWinds hack, discovered in December 2020, impacted thousands of companies and government offices globally, making it one of the largest and most sophisticated attacks the world has ever seen.\n\nMicrosoft President Brad Smith called the SolarWinds hack \"the largest and most sophisticated attack the world has ever seen.\" The breach allowed the hackers to gain access to high-level government networks, including those of the U.S. Treasury, Defense, and State Departments.\n\nRussia's spy chief, Sergey Naryshkin, denied responsibility for the SolarWinds cyber attack but was \"flattered\" by the accusations from the U.S. and Britain. The U.S. and Britain have blamed Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) for the SolarWinds hack.\n\nMicrosoft indicates the attacks seem to be part of intelligence collection efforts targeted at government agencies involved in foreign policy. The hackers reportedly used a sophisticated technique called \"living-off-the-land,\" which allows them to blend in with normal network activity and avoid detection.\n\nThe SolarWinds attack marked a significant escalation in state-sponsored cyber espionage, as the hackers exploited a zero-day vulnerability in SolarWinds' Orion software to gain access to networks. SolarWinds, an American software company, is widely used by government agencies and Fortune 500 companies to manage their IT infrastructure.\n\nThe consequences of the SolarWinds hack continue to ripple through the business world, with companies like FireEye, Microsoft, and Cisco reporting that their own networks had been breached as a result of the attack. The hackers are believed to have spent months inside these networks, siphoning off sensitive data.\n\nThe latest attacks by Nobelium serve as a reminder of the ongoing threat of state-sponsored cyber espionage and the need for organizations to be vigilant and proactive in securing their networks. Cybersecurity experts warn that such attacks are likely to become more frequent and sophisticated in the future.\n\nThe U.S. government and its allies have vowed to hold those responsible for the cyber attacks accountable. In response to the SolarWinds hack, the U.S. imposed sanctions on several Russian entities and individuals believed to be involved in the attack. However, it remains to be seen whether these measures will deter future cyber attacks from Russia or other state-sponsored hacking groups."}

The incident, which occurred in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, left Woods with significant injuries that required emergency surgery.\n\nAccording to Dr. Anish Mahajan, the Chief Medical Officer at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, where Woods was initially treated, \"Mr. Woods suffered complex fractures in his right lower extremity. The orthopedic trauma team at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center treated Mr. Woods' injuries, including a open fracture in the upper right tibia and fibula. The injuries were stabilized with a rod, screws, and pins.\"\n\nWoods was later transferred to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles for follow-up procedures. In a statement released by the hospital, they shared that \"Mr. Woods is currently recovering at Cedars-Sinai. His orthopedic injuries have been addressed, and he is now working closely with our medical team to focus on his rehabilitation and recovery.\"\n\nCarlos Gonzalez, a Sheriff's Deputy with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, who was among the first responders at the scene of the accident, shared his thoughts on the incident. \"It was a very chaotic scene when we arrived. Mr. Woods was extricated from the vehicle and transported to Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in critical condition. Our thoughts are with him and his family during this difficult time.\"\n\nThe Woods family has expressed their gratitude for the outpouring of support and messages they have received since the accident. \"Our family wants to thank everyone for the incredible outpouring of support and love. We are so grateful for the dedication and care Tiger has received from the medical teams at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and Cedars-Sinai. We ask for privacy during this time as Tiger continues to focus on his recovery.\"\n\nThe accident caused major damage to Woods' car, leaving it mangled and unrecognizable. The cause of the accident is still under investigation, but it is believed that Woods lost control of his vehicle and rolled over several times before coming to a stop.\n\nAs Woods begins his journey towards recovery, he faces a long and arduous road ahead. A source close to the golfer shared, \"Tiger is a fighter, and he's going to do everything he can to get back on the golf course. But this is a significant injury, and he's going to have to make some tough decisions about his career as he recovers.\"\n\nDespite the challenges that lie ahead, those close to Woods remain optimistic about his resilience and determination. \"Tiger has always been known for his grit and his ability to bounce back from adversity. We have no doubt that he will do everything in his power to make a full recovery and get back to the sport he loves.\"\n\nAs Woods focuses on his recovery, the golfing community and beyond have rallied around him, offering their support and well-wishes. \"Tiger is an inspiration to millions of people around the world, and we know that he will come out of this stronger than ever,\" said a spokesperson for the PGA Tour. \"Our thoughts are with him and his family during this difficult time, and we look forward to seeing him back on the course when he's ready.\"\n\nIn the coming weeks and months, Woods' recovery will be closely watched by fans and the media alike. But for now, the focus is on his health and well-being, as he takes the first steps on the long and challenging road to recovery."}

The incident left Woods with serious injuries, including a comminuted open fracture in his right leg.\n\nThe golfing world reacted swiftly to the devastating news, with several prominent figures announcing their intention to honor Woods during their respective tournaments. Justin Thomas, the reigning PGA Champion, stated, \"I'll definitely be wearing red and black this week in honor of Tiger.\" Rory McIlroy, Patrick Reed, and Annika Sorenstam, among others, followed suit.\n\nAs investigators pieced together the facts surrounding the crash, forensic experts theorized that Woods might not have been paying full attention before losing control of his SUV. Neil Shouse, a former deputy district attorney who now runs his own law firm, shared his perspective: \"Based on the available information, it appears that inattention may have played a role in the accident. However, a definitive cause will only be determined through a thorough investigation.\"\n\nContrary to initial reports, the evidence does not suggest that excessive speeding was a factor in the crash. Shouse elaborated, \"It's important to note that while speeding can contribute to accidents, it's not always the sole cause. In this case, there may be other factors at play, such as distraction or road conditions.\"\n\nAaron Hicks, New York Yankees outfielder and boyfriend of Woods' niece, Cheyenne Woods, expressed his concern for Woods' recovery. \"Tiger's a part of our family, and we're all just hoping for the best right now.

The incident sent shockwaves through the energy sector and raised concerns about potential gas shortages and price spikes. However, a new study co-authored by Associate Professor Tsvetan Tsvetanov and doctoral student Srishti Slaria at the University of Kansas found that the shutdown's impact on gas prices was significantly less than initially reported.\n\nIn an interview, Tsvetanov, an Associate Professor of Economics at the University of Kansas, stated, \"The media initially reported that the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack could lead to a substantial increase in gasoline prices. However, our study found that the actual impact was quite modest.\"\n\nSlaria added, \"We used daily regular gasoline price data at the city level and employed a difference-in-differences approach to assess the impact of the pipeline shutdown on gasoline prices.\"\n\nThe Colonial Pipeline can carry 3 million barrels of fuel per day between Texas and New York, serving as a crucial supply for the East Coast and the Southeast. Despite the pipeline's importance, the study found that the shutdown only led to a 4-cents-per-gallon increase in average gasoline prices in affected areas.\n\nTsvetanov explained, \"The demand for gasoline in the U.S. is described as 'inelastic,' meaning consumption doesn't change significantly even as prices rise.\"\n\nThe study's findings challenge the initial media reports and highlight the importance of rigorous economic analysis in understanding the impact of cyberattacks on energy markets.\n\nColonial paid a $4.4 million ransom in Bitcoin to the hackers, but the Justice Department later recovered $2.3 million of it.

Nemer stated, \"Facebook's Free Basics program aimed to expand internet access, but it faced criticism for creating a monopolized market, especially in the Global South.\"\n\nPereira added, \"Critics argue that Facebook uses its market dominance to manipulate consumer behavior and extract data, which can be used for targeted advertising or even political influence.\" Goulart noted, \"The outage highlighted the cultural and economic power of WhatsApp, which other messaging options in Brazil cannot match.\"\n\nThe outage revealed the platform's embeddedness in daily digital living and caused significant disruptions in communication and business. Nemer explained, \"WhatsApp is not just a tool for personal communication. It's used for business transactions, customer service, and even education.\" Pereira added, \"The outage showed just how reliant we've become on these platforms and the potential consequences of their failure.\"\n\nThe power amassed by Facebook, and by extension WhatsApp, has attracted scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators worldwide. In Europe, the Digital Markets Act aims to rein in tech giants. In India, the Competition Commission is investigating Facebook's market dominance. And in the US, lawmakers have called for antitrust action and public utility regulation.\n\nGoulart summarized the situation, \"The WhatsApp outage was a stark reminder of the importance of these platforms in our daily lives and the potential consequences of their failure. It's crucial that regulators address the market dominance of tech giants and ensure fair competition and consumer protection.\" As the digital landscape continues to evolve, the role of these platforms in our lives and economies will only become more significant."}

As lawmakers grapple with the question, new data has emerged, shedding light on how previous stimulus payments were spent by low-income and high-income families.\n\nBefore the distribution of stimulus checks on January 4, 2021, spending patterns between low-income and high-income families were remarkably similar, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The economic downturn forced both groups to tighten their belts, with spending on discretionary items such as dining out, travel, and entertainment taking a hit.\n\nHowever, real-time economic data from credit card companies and payroll processors painted a different picture post-stimulus checks. Low-income families, according to this data, saw a significant increase in spending shortly after receiving their $600 payments. In contrast, high-income households spent a much smaller percentage of their checks.\n\nThe disparity in spending is a reflection of the different economic realities faced by low-income and high-income families during the recession. Low-income households were more likely to experience job losses and wage cuts, while high-income individuals were more likely to keep their jobs and even see pay raises. As a result, low-income families were forced to rely on the stimulus checks to make ends meet.\n\nAdvocates of using real-time economic data to guide policy decisions argue that this information provides a more accurate and timely picture of the economy than historical data. In the case of the stimulus checks, real-time data showed that the initial $600 payments had a significant impact on low- and middle-income households.\n\nAn analysis by Moody's Analytics predicts that providing $1,400 to higher-income households would result in less immediate economic activity. This is because high-income households are more likely to save their money rather than spend it. In contrast, low-income households are more likely to spend their stimulus checks quickly.\n\nThe economic downturn has impacted low- and high-income individuals differently, with high-income individuals saving more. According to data from the Federal Reserve, the savings rate for high-income households increased from 5.8% in 2019 to 18.3% in 2020, while the savings rate for low-income households increased from 2.2% to 10.5%.\n\nThe use of real-time economic data can reveal diverse experiences across America, aiding targeted support and relief efforts. For example, data from JPMorgan Chase & Co. showed that spending in low-income neighborhoods rebounded more quickly after the stimulus checks were distributed than in high-income neighborhoods. This information can help policymakers tailor their relief efforts to address the unique challenges faced by different communities.\n\nHowever, the use of real-time economic data is not without its challenges. There are concerns about privacy and data security, as well as the potential for this information to be misused or manipulated. Policymakers must balance the benefits of using real-time data to inform policy decisions with these concerns.\n\nAs the debate over the next round of stimulus checks continues, policymakers must consider the findings from real-time economic data to ensure that relief efforts are targeted effectively and efficiently. By focusing on the needs of low-income households, who are more likely to spend their stimulus checks immediately, policymakers can help jumpstart the economic recovery and provide much-needed relief to those who have been hardest hit by the recession."}

Yet, even as we celebrate this victory, the tragic reality remains that over 60 people have been killed by police in the US during the three weeks of the Chauvin trial, and over 1,000 are killed annually (Minton, 2021). The conviction is not seen as an indictment on policing as a whole, but as a call for systemic accountability.\n\nPatrick Yoes, National President of the Fraternal Order of Police, has suggested that Chauvin acted in isolation, stating, \"There's no blue line over the death of George Floyd. There's no blue line over Derek Chauvin's actions\" (Yoes, 2021). However, critics argue that this view ignores the systemic issues that allow police misconduct to go unchecked. The challenge in convicting police officers, especially in racially charged incidents, was highlighted by the prosecution team during the Chauvin trial.\n\nProsecutor Jerry Blackwell made this clear during closing arguments: \"You can believe your eyes. You can trust your instincts. You can believe the testimony of your fellow citizens. And you can believe the evidence that you've seen and heard in this courtroom. And when you've done that, you've reached the right verdict\" (CNN, 2021). The substantial evidence presented in the Chauvin trial and the diverse jury that delivered the verdict represent an outlier in the norm of police brutality cases.\n\nGood police officers often face repercussions for reporting misconduct, contributing to the issue of the 'blue wall of silence.' In response, community oversight boards and changes in policies are being proposed to protect officers who report misconduct and hold their departments accountable. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz recently signed into law a package of police accountability bills, including measures to create a statewide police oversight agency and end qualified immunity for police officers (Star Tribune, 2021).\n\nA shift in accountability is also being suggested, from taxpayers to police officers and their departments. Ending qualified immunity and creating liability insurances for police departments can help ensure that officers are held accountable for their actions. However, these measures must be accompanied by broader systemic changes to address police brutality and the pursuit of an equitable democracy.\n\nThe Chauvin trial and the larger issue of police brutality reflect a broader issue of systemic racial inequality in the criminal justice system. As the Reverend Al Sharpton noted in his eulogy for George Floyd, \"We are here because we are the last people who are supposed to be unprotected. We are the hunted, not the hunters\" (NPR, 2021).\n\nIn the words of Angela Davis, \"Prisons do not disappear problems; they disappear human beings\" (Davis, 1971). The criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets and harms communities of color, must be transformed to prioritize rehabilitation, community restoration, and racial equity. We must continue to demand justice for all victims of police brutality and work towards a society where all people are truly equal under the law.\n\nIn the words of Martin Luther King Jr., \"The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice\" (King, 1958). Let us continue to bend that arc.\n\nReferences: - CNN. (2021, April 20).

Among them are \"The Rookie\" and \"The Boys.\" Eric Kripke, showrunner for \"The Boys,\" shared, \"There's no reason for us to risk the safety of our cast and crew for the sake of authenticity.\"\n\nA petition initiated by filmmaker Bandar Albuliwi on Change.org has garnered nearly 70,000 signatures, advocating for a ban on real guns and live ammo on film and TV sets. Albuliwi stated, \"We can no longer ignore the potential consequences of using real firearms on sets. It's time for a change.\"\n\nCalifornia State Senator Dave Cortese and New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham are pushing for legislative action. Cortese declared, \"We need stronger regulations to protect the lives of those working behind the scenes.\" Lujan Grisham added, \"New Mexico has a rich film industry, but safety must be our top priority.\"\n\nFilmmaker and activist Cameron Kasky, a survivor of the Parkland shooting, weighed in on the issue. \"The film industry needs to take a hard look at its safety standards,\" he urged. \"We've seen the devastating consequences of complacency.\"\n\nAdvances in visual effects technology have made it increasingly unnecessary to use real firearms for authenticity in production. Visual effects artists can easily create gun effects like muzzle flashes in post-production. Leslie Grossman echoed this sentiment, stating, \"There's no need to put lives at risk for a visual effect that can be achieved in post.\"\n\nHowever, concerns have been raised about on-set safety standards and oversight, particularly outside Los Angeles where many productions are filmed. Grossman highlighted a culture that often silences safety concerns, stressing, \"No story is worth risking lives for.\"\n\nAs the film industry grapples with this issue, it remains to be seen what measures will be taken to ensure the safety of cast and crew members. One thing is clear: the tragic events on the set of \"Rust\" have shone a spotlight on the need for change.\n\nEric Kripke weighed in on the issue, expressing his belief that \"the film industry can and should do better when it comes to safety. We owe it to our cast and crew to make sure they're working in a safe environment.\"\n\nCalifornia State Senator Dave Cortese added, \"We cannot afford to wait for another tragedy to occur. It's time for action.\"\n\nAs the debate continues, the film industry faces a pivotal moment in its history. Will it choose to prioritize safety and adapt to technological advancements, or cling to outdated practices that put lives at risk? The answer will undoubtedly shape the future of film and television production.\n\nMichelle Lujan Grisham emphasized, \"We cannot allow the pursuit of authenticity to overshadow the importance of safety. Lives are at stake.\"\n\nBandar Albuliwi, the filmmaker behind the Change.org petition, summed up the sentiment of many when he stated, \"It's time for the film industry to evolve and prioritize safety over authenticity.

As the world grapples with the implications of this geopolitical shift, one question looms large: How are extremist groups like the Taliban and al Qaeda using social media to disseminate their messages and recruit followers?\n\nAccording to reports, pro-al Qaeda and Taliban groups are increasingly active on Twitter, despite the platform's stated policies against violent extremist content. Joe Concha, media and politics columnist for The Hill and a Fox News contributor, shares his concerns: \"Twitter's failure to prevent the Taliban from using its platform for propaganda and recruitment is a serious issue that must be addressed.\"\n\nThe Taliban's presence on Twitter is not limited to grassroots supporters. Spokesmen, including Zabihullah Mujahid, who boasts nearly 320,000 followers, maintain active accounts. Mujahid has been accused of making threatening statements against the U.S. and its allies.\n\nWhen asked about the Taliban's presence on the platform, a Twitter spokesperson stated, \"Our top priority is keeping people safe and emphasizing enforcement of rules against the glorification of violence.\" However, critics argue that the Taliban's use of Twitter for propaganda and recruitment falls under this category.\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, The Washington Post defended the Taliban's use of social media, citing their 'strikingly sophisticated social media tactics.' In comparison, the paper noted, former President Donald Trump's Twitter account, which was suspended for violating platform rules against hate speech, does not pose the same threat.\n\nHowever, incidents of Taliban violence towards women and those associated with the U.S. starkly contrast with their seemingly benign social media presence. For instance, the Taliban have reportedly banned girls from attending school, and women are being forced to wear the burqa in public.\n\nDespite this, the Taliban's use of social media raises another troubling question: Why is Twitter allowing their presence while former President Donald Trump remains banned? Trump's account was suspended for inciting violence during the U.S. Capitol riots on January 6, 2021.\n\nConcha adds, \"Twitter's inconsistent application of its rules against violent extremist content is problematic and undermines the credibility of the platform as a whole.\" This inconsistency not only raises concerns about Twitter's commitment to keeping users safe but also poses a significant threat to national security.\n\nIn conclusion, as the Taliban continues to use Twitter to disseminate their messages and recruit followers, it is crucial that social media platforms take a more robust stance against extremist content. The safety and security of citizens both at home and abroad depend on it. As Joe Concha aptly puts it, \"It's time for Twitter to walk the talk and enforce its rules consistently and without bias.\"\n\n\"Twitter's inconsistent application of its rules against violent extremist content is problematic and undermines the credibility of the platform as a whole.\" - Joe Concha, Media and politics columnist for The Hill and a Fox News contributor.\n\n\"Our top priority is keeping people safe and emphasizing enforcement of rules against the glorification of violence.\" - Twitter spokesperson.\n\n\"It's time for Twitter to walk the talk and enforce its rules consistently and without bias.\" - Joe Concha, Media and politics columnist for The Hill and a Fox News contributor.\n\n\"Twitter's failure to prevent the Taliban from using its platform for propaganda and recruitment is a serious issue that must be addressed.\" - Joe Concha, Media and politics columnist for The Hill and a Fox News contributor.\n\n\"The Washington Post defended the Taliban's use of social media, citing their 'strikingly sophisticated social media tactics'.\" - The Washington Post.\n\n\"The Taliban's presence on Twitter is not limited to grassroots supporters.

Cybersecurity expert Lisa Donnan found herself stranded when the Colonial Pipeline, a major fuel supplier, fell victim to a cyber-attack. Speaking to the Guardian, Donnan emphasized the gravity of the situation: \"This is a stark reminder of the escalating cyber threats we face, and how vulnerable our critical infrastructure has become.\"\n\nThe Colonial Pipeline attack is not an isolated incident. In recent months, the US and the world have witnessed a surge in cyber-attacks targeting critical infrastructure and services. In May, JBS, the world's largest meat processor, was forced to shut down its operations after being hit by a ransomware attack. School districts and hospitals have also been affected, causing disruptions and putting essential services at risk.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken addressed these concerns during a press conference, stating, \"We're seeing an alarming trend of ransomware attacks against critical infrastructure and other sectors that are essential to our economic and national security.\"\n\nEric Green, the Senior director for Russia and Central Asia at the National Security Council, pointed the finger at Russia as a major player in the surge of ransomware attacks. President Biden plans to address this issue during a summit with Russian President Putin, scheduled for June 16.\n\nSteven Pifer, a former deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs and a Senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, echoed Green's sentiments: \"There's growing evidence that Russia's intelligence services and criminal gangs are collaborating in these attacks.\"\n\nIn response to the growing threats, there is a push for NATO to enhance its cyberdefense capabilities. According to NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, \"Cybersecurity is an essential aspect of our collective defense.\"\n\nExperts have reported a significant increase in ransomware attacks, with a 62% global rise since 2019 and a 158% spike in North America. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these vulnerabilities, as organizations rushed to digitize their operations and implement remote work arrangements.\n\nCybercriminals often face minimal consequences, making ransomware attacks a lucrative business. Cryptocurrencies, which facilitate anonymous ransom payments, have played a significant role in this trend.\n\nDespite being a major target for cyber-attacks and the biggest spender on cybersecurity, the US faces challenges in prosecuting cybercriminals and securing international cooperation. As Tony Blinken acknowledged, \"We need stronger international norms and mechanisms to hold those responsible for these attacks accountable.\"\n\nNotable cyber-attacks have exploited tools developed by the US National Security Agency (NSA), raising concerns about internal vulnerabilities. In 2017, the WannaCry ransomware attack, which infected over 200,000 computers in 150 countries, used a tool called EternalBlue, which was stolen from the NSA.\n\nDespite increased spending on cybersecurity, addressing these challenges requires a multifaceted approach. According to a report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the global cybersecurity market is projected to reach $248.3 billion by 2023. However, the report also highlights the need for stronger international cooperation, improved public-private partnerships, and a greater focus on cybersecurity education and workforce development.\n\nIn closing, Lisa Donnan's personal experience of the Colonial Pipeline attack serves as a stark reminder of the potential consequences of cyber-attacks on critical infrastructure. As the digital realm increasingly intertwines with the physical world, it is crucial that we invest in robust cyberdefenses and address the root causes of these threats. In the words of Tony Blinken, \"Cybersecurity is not just an IT issue; it's a national security issue.\""}

The Santa Fe County Sheriff's Department stated that the investigation into the incident remains open and active, with no charges filed as of yet.\n\nThe film industry prides itself on extensive safety protocols that have made incidents involving firearms an anomaly. \"Despite what happened on the 'Rust' set, it's important to remember that such incidents are extremely rare in film production,\" Biddiss added.\n\nIn the film industry, prop weapons can be actual firearms modified to fire blanks. While blanks are designed to minimize the risk, they still pose potential dangers. \"Firearms, even when used with blanks, can still cause serious injury or death if not handled properly,\" Biddiss warned.\n\nTo make automatic weapons safe for filming, restrictors and blank-firing adapters are used. Restrictors limit the number of rounds that can be fired in succession, while blank-firing adapters ensure that only blanks are discharged.\n\nThe death of actor Brandon Lee on the set of \"The Crow\" in 1993 serves as a grim reminder of the potential risks involved in film production. Lee was killed by a .44 Magnum revolver loaded with a live round instead of a blank.\n\nWeapons safety on film sets involves extensive training, weapons inspections, and adherence to strict protocols. The film's armorer, responsible for weapon safety, was among the witnesses interviewed by police in the aftermath of the incident on the \"Rust\" set.\n\n\"Film productions go to great lengths to ensure the safety of cast and crew members when handling firearms,\" Biddiss stated. \"But accidents can still happen, and it's a sobering reminder of the importance of vigilance and adherence to safety protocols.\"\n\nAs the investigation into the incident on the \"Rust\" set continues, the film community is left to grapple with the implications for the industry and the tragic loss of life.

The promotion, sent out via text message, included deals on firearms, optics, bags, and gun parts.\n\nThomas Bolsch, the owner of Saddle River Range, defended the sale, stating that it celebrated the Second Amendment and self-defense rights, not the loss of life. \"We believe in the Second Amendment and the right to self-defense,\" Bolsch told KPRC. \"We saw the verdict as a victory for those principles, and we wanted to share that excitement with our customers.\"\n\nHowever, the promotion has received mixed reactions from the public. Dr. James Dixon, president of the NAACP Houston Branch, expressed disappointment over the store capitalizing on a sensitive situation. \"This is a time when our country is deeply divided, and we need to be sensitive to the feelings of all communities,\" Dixon said. \"Promotions like this only serve to widen the divide.\"\n\nDespite criticism, Bolsch claims most customer feedback has been supportive and positive. \"Our customers understand that we're not glorifying violence, but rather celebrating the right to defend oneself,\" he said.\n\nThe broader context of protests against racial injustice following the shooting of Jacob Blake in Wisconsin added fuel to the controversy. Dixon emphasized the need for sensitivity in promotional messages. \"Businesses have a responsibility to consider the broader implications of their actions,\" he said.\n\nThe store's promotion has sparked a conversation about the intersection of business practices and societal issues. Some argue that businesses have a right to promote their products and services as they see fit, while others believe they have a responsibility to consider the potential impact on their community.\n\nBolsch stands by his message and would not change the promotion. \"We believe in the Second Amendment and the right to self-defense,\" he reiterated. \"That's what this sale is about.\"\n\nDespite the controversy, Saddle River Range is not alone in using current events to promote sales. Other gun stores and businesses have used similar tactics in the past, sparking debates about the ethics of such marketing strategies.\n\nAs the conversation continues, one thing is clear: the intersection of business practices and societal issues is a complex and nuanced issue that requires thoughtful consideration and dialogue."}

The decision came after last week's violent storming of the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters.\n\n\"Sadly, but with confidence and humility, I hereby give notice that I shall transmit to the Senate a resolution (H.Res. 24) that will impeach Donald John Trump, President of the United States, for high crimes and misdemeanors,\" Pelosi wrote in a letter to her Democratic colleagues.\n\nOn Tuesday, the House will vote on a resolution urging Vice President Mike Pence and Cabinet officials to invoke the 25th Amendment. If that fails, articles of impeachment could be voted on as early as Wednesday. The 25th Amendment allows the vice president and the Cabinet to remove a president deemed unfit.\n\nPelosi stated, \"The president's dangerous and seditious acts threaten our democratic institutions, our constitution, and our very democracy.

Speaking to CNN, Svetnoy recounted, \"Everything was fine, and we were just about to move on to the next setup when this happened.\"\n\nAlec Baldwin, portraying a character in the film, was rehearsing with a prop gun provided by the film's armorer, Hannah Gutierrez Reed, when the gun discharged. Witnesses reported that Baldwin was given the gun by assistant director Dave Halls, who announced it as a 'cold gun,' implying that it was safe and unloaded.\n\nHowever, the 9mm prop gun discharged, fatally wounding Hutchins, 42, and injuring Souza. In a statement to CNN, Halls said, \"I called out 'cold gun,' and I saw the muzzle rise. I didn't see a spark, and I didn't hear a click. I saw a misfire, and then I heard what sounded like a whip and then loud pops.\"\n\nA 911 call from the script supervisor on the set, obtained by CNN, reveals the initial confusion and chaos following the shooting:\n\nUnnamed script supervisor: \"I need an ambulance, please. We've had an accident on set. I need an ambulance right away. We've had a shooting.\"\n\nUnnamed 911 call man: \"Are you saying someone's been shot?\"\n\nUnnamed script supervisor: \"Yes, and we need an ambulance.\"\n\nHutchins was airlifted to the University of New Mexico Hospital but was later pronounced dead. Souza, who was treated and released from the hospital, described the scene in an interview with Deadline:\n\nJoel Souza: \"I was just trying to get out of the way, and fortunately, I was able to get out of the line of fire. I saw Halyna fall to the ground after being hit. It was a chaotic scene, and everyone was in a state of shock.\"\n\nInvestigators, including the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office, seized Baldwin's clothes and the prop gun among other items as evidence. The production company, Rust Movie Productions LLC, issued a statement expressing its intention to cooperate fully with the ongoing investigation:\n\nProduction company spokesperson: \"The entire Rust film crew is devastated by this tragic accident. We are cooperating fully with the Santa Fe authorities in their investigation and offer our full support to the officers, investigators, and all other agencies involved.\"\n\nOn January 19, 2023, Baldwin and armorer Hannah Gutierrez Reed were announced to be charged with involuntary manslaughter in relation to the incident. A spokesperson for the New Mexico First Judicial District Attorney's Office stated, \"When the evidence shows you have abandoned your duty to the public, then it's time to answer for your actions.\"\n\nHutchins is mourned as a rising talent in Hollywood, and her family has expressed support for the charges, emphasizing that no one is above the law.

Trump unfolded over more than 27 hours in the Senate chamber, producing a record of over 140,000 words. According to an analysis by The Washington Post, House impeachment managers accounted for approximately 91,000 words, while Trump's legal team contributed nearly 33,000 words.\n\nRep. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.), the lead impeachment manager, addressed the Senate for just over 26,000 words. Raskin stated, \"We have come to impeach Donald John Trump, not to convict him, but to impeach him, so that the Senate and the nation can consider whether Donald John Trump should ever again be permitted to hold public office.\"\n\nJoining Raskin were Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), Rep. David N. Cicilline (D-R.I.), Rep. Joe Neguse (D-Colo.), and Del. Stacey Plaskett (D-Virgin Islands). Each impeachment manager contributed significant words, with Cicilline speaking nearly 12,000 words and Neguse around 11,000. Plaskett, the only impeachment manager who is not a member of the House, spoke just under 10,000 words.\n\nTrump's legal team, consisting of attorneys David Schoen, Bruce L. Castor Jr., and Michael T. van der Veen, spoke a combined total of just under 33,000 words. Schoen, who represented Trump during the final days of the trial, stated, \"President Trump's actions on January 6 were the antithesis of an insurrection; they were lawful.\"\n\nUnlike the first impeachment trial, the speaking time in the second trial was more evenly distributed among speakers. Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) spoke 1,256 words, primarily on procedural motions. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), who presided over the trial, collectively spoke over 15,000 words.\n\nBoth sides relied heavily on video presentations during their opening arguments. The impeachment managers showed footage from the January 6 Capitol riots, while Trump's defense team presented clips from Trump's speeches, emphasizing his calls for peace.\n\nVideos, testimonials, and audio footage from the January 6 events were crucial elements of the House managers' strategy. Rep. David N. Cicilline shared, \"This is not a normal day at the Capitol. This is not a protest. This is not free speech. This is a violent insurrection.\"\n\nRep. Joe Neguse added, \"Donald Trump incited this mob to storm the Capitol, to assault and injure law enforcement officers, and to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power.\"\n\nSen. Adam Schiff, who led the impeachment managers during Trump's first trial, stated, \"The evidence is clear.

She was reported missing on September 11, ten days after Laundrie returned home alone to North Port, Florida.\n\nSince then, Laundrie has only communicated through a lawyer and has not provided any information to the police. Petito's family and law enforcement have urged the Laundrie family to provide any details they may have about the couple's whereabouts during the weeks leading up to Petito's disappearance.\n\nThe North Port Police Department named Laundrie as a person of interest in Petito's disappearance.

Kizer asserts she acted in self-defense when she shot Volar in 2018. Her trial is pending, and she currently faces multiple felony charges.\n\nRittenhouse, who was 17 at the time of the protest, was acquitted earlier this month after his defense team argued he acted in self-defense when he killed two men during the unrest. The jury agreed, and Rittenhouse was found not guilty on all charges.\n\nActivists and advocates for Kizer are urging similar consideration for her case. \"It's a double standard,\" said Jess Singh, a Kenosha resident and protestor. \"Both Chrystul and Kyle claimed they acted in self-defense. Why is one being treated differently?\"\n\nProtests were held in Kenosha following Rittenhouse's acquittal, aiming to bring attention to Kizer's case and the larger issue of sex trafficking in the community. The rallies echoed those that occurred during the Black Lives Matter protests last year.\n\nAn appeals court has granted Kizer the right to use the 'affirmative' defense in her trial, which argues her actions were a direct result of being trafficked. However, the State Supreme Court is currently reviewing whether she will be allowed to use this defense.\n\nKizer was released on bond in 2020 after community groups raised over $400,000 for her bail. In contrast, Rittenhouse's bond was set at $2 million, also funded by supporters. \"The disparities don't end with the trial itself,\" said Singh. \"The entire legal process is stacked against Chrystul.\"\n\nAdvocates argue that Kizer's case warrants special consideration due to her status as a victim of human trafficking. \"Chrystul is a survivor, not a criminal,\" said Singh. \"Her actions were a desperate attempt to save her own life.\"\n\nKizer's defense team will present evidence of her trafficking history and the abuse she suffered at the hands of Volar during the trial. If successful, this could lead to a reduced sentence or even an acquittal.\n\nThe contrasting outcomes of Kizer and Rittenhouse's cases have sparked intense debate and discussion about self-defense laws, the justice system, and the treatment of victims in the legal process.\n\nAs the legal battles for both Chrystul Kizer and Kyle Rittenhouse continue, advocates remain hopeful that justice will be served for all parties involved. \"It's about more than just these two cases,\" said Singh. \"It's about ensuring that survivors of trafficking and other forms of violence are treated with the respect and dignity they deserve.\"\n\nQuote from Jess Singh: \"It's a double standard.

This compares to the Federal Reserve's current monthly expansion of $120 billion.\n\nLagarde emphasized that the decision to reduce asset purchases is a 'recalibration' rather than tapering, echoing similar stances taken by other major central banks, such as the Bank of Japan, Bank of Canada, Bank of England, Reserve Bank of New Zealand, and Reserve Bank of Australia, which have already started tapering or ending their QE programs.\n\nThe PEPP will see a 'moderately lower' pace of net asset purchases, continuing at least until March 2022, with a balance level maintained at least until the end of 2023.

Central banks globally agree that QE programs need to end before interest rates can be hiked to avoid disrupting the yield curve.\n\nDespite the consensus on the need to start tapering among major central banks, the Federal Reserve is still expanding its balance sheet by $120 billion a month.\n\nLagarde reaffirmed the unanimous decision to recalibrate asset purchases amidst efforts to navigate exiting QE without destabilizing the Eurozone economy.

An additional 900,000 payments were made to low-income individuals in this category.\n\nThe third round of stimulus payments, authorized in March, offers up to $1,400 per person and is expected to reach 85% of households. Eligible families can also receive $1,400 per dependent, including for adult dependents over 17, with the amount phasing out at higher income levels.\n\nBesides the stimulus payments, the American Rescue Plan also significantly expands the child tax credit. Eligible parents will receive $3,600 for each child under 6 and $3,000 for each child under 18, with at least half being paid over the summer in periodic payments, starting July 15.\n\nThe child tax credit has been made fully refundable, potentially making 20 million more children eligible for the benefit, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. This means that even families with very low incomes can receive the full credit.\n\nThe IRS has been working to process and issue these payments as quickly as possible, using information from 2019 and 2020 tax returns. The agency encourages those who haven't received their payments yet to check the Get My Payment tool on IRS.gov for the most up-to-date information on their payment status.\n\nThese stimulus payments are part of the larger American Rescue Plan, which also includes provisions to provide financial relief to small businesses, extend unemployment benefits, and increase funding for vaccine distribution and COVID-19 testing and contact tracing.\n\nIn the coming months, the IRS will continue to process and issue stimulus payments, child tax credit payments, and other benefits authorized under the American Rescue Plan. The agency will provide updates on its website and through its social media channels as more information becomes available."}

People were running and screaming. I saw several injured people being taken away from the area.\"\n\nThe attack targeted the mother's memorial service for Zabihullah Mujahid, who has been a key spokesperson for the Taliban since their takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but ISIL-affiliated fighters have increased their attacks against the Taliban and expanded their presence closer to Kabul in recent months.\n\nThis explosion underscores the growing security challenges faced by the Taliban, as they struggle to maintain control and stability in the country. Following the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in late August, ISIS-K claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing that targeted American evacuation efforts, killing over 170 Afghans and 13 U.S. service members.\n\nBilal Karimi acknowledged the security challenges, stating, \"The Taliban are working to ensure the safety and security of all Afghans. We are taking all necessary measures to prevent such incidents.\"\n\nHowever, the attack is seen as undermining the Taliban's claim of enhanced security in Afghanistan, as the country continues to face instability and economic challenges under their rule.\n\nAdditionally, ISKP has been increasing its attacks against the Taliban and expanding its presence closer to Kabul. In August, ISKP claimed responsibility for an attack on a Taliban checkpoint near the capital city, killing several Taliban fighters.\n\nThe broader context of security and economic challenges facing Afghanistan under Taliban rule is further highlighted by the attack. Many Afghans are facing food shortages and economic instability, with the United Nations warning of a potential humanitarian crisis in the coming months.\n\nThe Taliban have pledged to provide security and stability to the Afghan people, but the recent attack in Kabul serves as a reminder of the ongoing security threats and challenges they face.\n\nBilal Karimi reiterated the Taliban's commitment to addressing these challenges, stating, \"We understand the concerns of the Afghan people, and we are working to address their needs and ensure their safety and security.\"\n\nMarco Puntin emphasized the importance of addressing the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, stating, \"The situation in Afghanistan is critical, and urgent action is needed to address the humanitarian needs of the Afghan people.\"\n\nAs the Taliban continue to navigate the complex security and economic challenges facing Afghanistan, the international community must work together to provide support and ensure the stability and security of the Afghan people.\n\nIn the aftermath of the attack, the Taliban have increased security measures in Kabul and launched investigations to identify the perpetrators. The international community, including the United Nations and the European Union, has condemned the attack and called for an end to the violence in Afghanistan.\n\nThe attack at the Eid Gah Mosque in Kabul serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing security challenges facing Afghanistan and the Taliban, as they work to establish stability and security in the country. The international community must continue to support the Afghan people and work with the Taliban to address these challenges and ensure a peaceful and prosperous future for Afghanistan.\n\nIn conclusion, the explosion outside the Eid Gah Mosque in Kabul during a memorial service for Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid's mother marked the first major attack in the city since late August. At least five civilians were killed, and four others were wounded. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but ISIL-affiliated fighters have increased their attacks against the Taliban and expanded their presence closer to Kabul. The attack underscores the growing security challenges faced by the Taliban and the broader context of security and economic challenges facing Afghanistan under their rule.

The stark contrast between the response to the Capitol breach and earlier Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests has sparked a national conversation about race, policing, and preparedness. Mark Anthony Neal, an African American studies professor at Duke University, posed an intriguing question: \"What if the protesters had been Black Lives Matter activists?\"\n\nMark Anthony Neal: \"The Capitol Police's response to the rioters, many of whom were white, was a far cry from how law enforcement handled mostly peaceful BLM protests over the summer. It raises important questions about race, privilege, and the role of law enforcement in American society.\"\n\nThe Capitol Police's handling of the riot has been widely criticized, with many questioning the preparedness and leadership of former Chief Steven Sund. In his resignation letter, Sund acknowledged the \"tragic events\" and stated that the department faced \"unprecedented challenges.\"\n\nSteven Sund: \"We were ill-prepared for the assault on the Capitol. Though we had intelligence about potential violence, we were unable to effectively respond.\"\n\nJeremy Pressman, an associate professor of political science and director of Middle East Studies at the University of Connecticut, believes the Capitol riot was a \"failure of law enforcement.\" Pressman asserts that the poorly prepared Capitol Police were unable to contain the chaos, resulting in the breach of the building.\n\nJeremy Pressman: \"The contrast between the response to the Capitol riot and BLM protests demonstrates a clear double standard when it comes to law enforcement and racial composition. It's unacceptable.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden has called for an independent commission to investigate the Capitol riot. In a statement, he expressed his belief that the commission would \"help ensure that such an assault on our Capitol and our Democracy cannot happen again.\"\n\nThe response to the Capitol riot has been compared to BLM protests, where law enforcement often clashed with demonstrators despite mostly peaceful protests. Brad Garrett, a retired FBI agent and ABC News contributor, believes the Capitol riot was a \"wake-up call\" for law enforcement.\n\nBrad Garrett: \"The events at the Capitol were a stark reminder of the importance of understanding community dynamics, preparing for various scenarios, and maintaining impartiality. The failure to do so can lead to disastrous consequences.\"\n\nDuring the George Floyd protests, law enforcement's response was often criticized for being disproportionate, leading to widespread unrest and calls for reform. The death of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May 2020 sparked protests across the country, many of which turned violent.\n\nThe Capitol riot has sparked a reconsideration of racism within law enforcement and American society. Neal emphasizes the need for a more nuanced understanding of the role of race in the context of protests and law enforcement responses.\n\nMark Anthony Neal: \"We cannot ignore the elephant in the room. Race has always been a factor in how law enforcement responds to protests. It's time we face this reality and work towards meaningful change.\"\n\nThe Michael Brown protests in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014, serve as an example of the disproportionate police response. The shooting of an unarmed Black teenager, Michael Brown, by a white police officer, Darren Wilson, led to widespread protests and unrest. The response from law enforcement was criticized for being heavy-handed and disproportionate.\n\nThe Capitol riot and its aftermath have highlighted the need for greater transparency, accountability, and reform within law enforcement. As the country moves forward, it's crucial to remember the lessons of the past and work towards a more equitable future for all.\n\nMark Anthony Neal: \"We cannot allow the events at the Capitol to be a one-off moment. We must continue the conversation about race, policing, and reform. The future of our democracy depends on it.\""}

The outcome of the trial, which centered on Trump's role in inciting the Capitol riot on January 6, marked a significant moment in American history but left many questioning the future of the Republican Party and the former president's political aspirations.\n\nDemocrats, who had briefly considered calling witnesses after new details emerged about Trump's behavior on January 6, ultimately decided against it due to a lack of bipartisan support. Jamie Gangel, a CNN reporter, shared her thoughts on the decision, stating, \"Democrats had the votes to call witnesses, but chose not to. They decided they didn't want to prolong the trial, and risk the possibility that it could turn into a partisan circus.\"\n\nThe trial served as a stark reminder of Trump's stronghold on the Republican Party. Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-WA), one of ten House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump, spoke out against her party's decision to acquit, saying, \"I believe the President of the United States broke his oath of office and incited a violent insurrection against the United States government. I cannot in good conscience vote to acquit.\"\n\nTrump's absence from Twitter, where he had previously wielded immense influence, has made him a much quieter political force. However, his influence and the events leading to the Capitol riot will continue to be subjects of public and legal scrutiny.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) criticized Trump's actions leading up to the riot but ultimately voted to acquit, citing the argument that the trial was unconstitutional for a former president. McConnell stated, \"There is no question, none at all, that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day.\"\n\nTrump's acquittal leaves open the possibility of him holding future office. Republican strategist Alex Conant shared his thoughts on the issue, stating, \"The Republican Party is still a pro-Trump party. He still has a hold over the base. As long as that's the case, it's not out of the question that he could run for office again.\"\n\nThe impeachment managers, led by Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD), presented an extensive case against Trump, using video footage to illustrate his role in inciting the riot. Raskin stated, \"The former President of the United States summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack. Everything that followed was his doing. None of this would have happened without him.\"\n\nThere are ongoing criminal investigations and pending cases related to the Capitol riot and Trump's efforts to influence election results. The Department of Justice is currently investigating potential crimes related to the riot, including sedition and obstruction of Congress.\n\nThe events leading up to the Capitol riot and Trump's role in them will continue to be subjects of public and legal scrutiny. The House select committee investigating the Capitol riot is expected to begin its work in the coming weeks, and it remains to be seen what new information will come to light.\n\nIn the aftermath of the trial, it is clear that the Republican Party remains deeply divided over the former president and his actions. As the country moves forward, the impact of the impeachment trial on American politics and the future of the Republican Party will continue to unfold."}

During his speech, he endorsed U.S. Rep. Ted Budd for a North Carolina U.S. Senate seat, praising him as a \"fighter.\"\n\n\"Ted Budd is going to be a tremendous senator for the great people of North Carolina,\" Trump said, adding, \"He's a fighter, and he's going to fight for you.\"\n\nBudd, who is seeking to replace retiring Republican Sen.

These incidents should not be viewed in isolation but rather as part of a larger trend, as terrorist groups and hostile nations like Iran and Syria are increasingly likely to launch attacks in multiple domains.\n\nTom Ridge, the former Republican governor of Pennsylvania and the first U.S. secretary of Homeland Security, emphasizes the urgency of addressing these threats: \"The Colonial Pipeline attack and the COVID-19 pandemic are clear indicators that our critical infrastructure is under siege from both cyber and biological threats.\"\n\nAccording to a recent report by Microsoft, a new wave of cyberattacks by the Russian-based group Nobelium has been targeting U.S. organizations. Nobelium is believed to have links to the Russian government and has previously been implicated in high-profile cyberattacks, such as the SolarWinds breach.\n\nTom Daschle, the former Democratic Senate Majority Leader, emphasizes the importance of recognizing the interconnectedness of cyber and biological threats: \"The Colonial Pipeline attack and the COVID-19 pandemic are not isolated incidents, but rather part of a larger trend of threats to our critical infrastructure.\"\n\nA forthcoming report by the Bipartisan Commission on Biodefense states that all U.S. critical infrastructure sectors are at risk of biological incidents. The report highlights the potential devastating impact of such incidents on public health, the economy, and national security.\n\nNone of the 16 U.S. critical infrastructure sectors has adequately planned for biological incidents. As Tom Ridge points out, \"The lack of planning and preparation for biological incidents is a major concern. We have seen this play out during the COVID-19 pandemic, where critical infrastructure sectors have struggled to adapt and respond effectively.\"\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the lack of preparedness of all critical infrastructure sectors for biological threats. As Tom Daschle explains, \"The pandemic has highlighted the need for better planning and preparation to protect critical infrastructure against biological threats. We cannot afford to wait for the next crisis to strike before taking action.\"\n\nThe 2014 avian influenza outbreak and the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the devastating impact of biological threats on the economy. The estimated economic impact of COVID-19 on the U.S. economy is $16 trillion.\n\nThe federal government and the private sector are seen as underprepared for dealing with biological incidents. According to Tom Ridge, \"The federal government and the private sector need to work together to develop comprehensive plans for addressing biological threats to critical infrastructure. This includes investing in research and development, improving data sharing and coordination, and increasing public awareness and education.\"\n\nAs Tom Daschle emphasizes, \"We cannot afford to ignore the threat of biological attacks to our critical infrastructure. The time for action is now.\"\n\nTom Ridge concludes, \"We have a responsibility to protect our critical infrastructure from both cyber and biological threats.

By working together, we can ensure that our critical infrastructure is resilient and able to withstand the challenges of the 21st century.\"\n\nTom Daschle adds, \"The Colonial Pipeline attack and the COVID-19 pandemic are wake-up calls. We must act now to strengthen our defenses against cyber and biological threats and ensure that our critical infrastructure is prepared for the challenges of the future.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack and the COVID-19 pandemic serve as stark reminders of the United States' vulnerabilities to cyber and biological threats. These incidents should not be viewed in isolation but rather as part of a larger trend, as terrorist groups and hostile nations are increasingly likely to launch attacks in multiple domains.

With winds reaching 150 mph, the hurricane brought devastation to the region, leaving more than 850,000 homes and businesses without power in Louisiana and Mississippi.\n\nIda, the ninth named storm of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season, intensified rapidly over warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico. Satellite imagery shows the storm's impact as it made landfall, with the storm's eye appearing as a dark circle amidst the swirling storm clouds.\n\nAs the storm moved inland, it weakened into a tropical storm. However, its impact was far from over. Over 16 inches of rain fell in parts of Louisiana, causing significant flooding. Satellite images before the storm showed Grand Isle, Louisiana, submerged due to heavy rains, offering a glimpse into the storm's destructive capabilities.\n\nDespite the devastation, New Orleans' flood-protection system, enhanced after Hurricane Katrina, prevented catastrophic flooding in the city. The system, which includes levees, floodwalls, and drainage pumps, worked to keep the city above water.\n\nOfficials had ordered evacuations along the coast, warning some areas may be uninhabitable for weeks. The extent of the damage is still being assessed, but it is clear that Hurricane Ida will leave a lasting impact on the Gulf Coast.\n\nHurricane Ida's rapid intensification was a reminder of the power of tropical storms in the Gulf of Mexico. Warm waters and favorable atmospheric conditions can fuel storms, making them more destructive. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) urges coastal residents to stay informed and take necessary precautions during hurricane season.\n\nAs the Gulf Coast begins to recover from Hurricane Ida, the focus turns to rebuilding and restoring power. Utilities are working to assess the damage and restore electricity as quickly and safely as possible. In the meantime, residents are encouraged to stay safe, follow evacuation orders, and check on their neighbors.

No serious safety concerns were identified.\n\nQuote 4 - Dr Mariângela Simão: \"The Sinopharm vaccine has met the muster for WHO Emergency Use Listing, demonstrating that it can effectively help protect people against COVID-19,\" stated Dr Simão.\n\nWHO's EUL is a significant milestone in the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It enables countries to make informed decisions about the use of vaccines in their populations and helps strengthen immunization systems.\n\nWHO continues to work with countries and partners to ensure that safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines reach the people who need them the most.\n\nQuote 5 - Dr Mariângela Simão: \"We will continue to work closely with Sinopharm and other vaccine manufacturers to ensure the timely and equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines,\" concluded Dr Simão.\n\nThe Sinopharm vaccine's addition to the list of WHO-approved COVID-19 vaccines is an important step forward in the global fight against the pandemic.\n\nBy working together, we can ensure that safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines reach people in all corners of the world, ultimately leading to an end to the pandemic."}

The intersection of 38th Street and Chicago Avenue, where Floyd lost his life in May 2020 after Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck, had transformed into a memorial and a movement's headquarters. Residents and activists had fortified the area with makeshift barriers, turning it into a symbol of resistance and memorial.\n\nJay Webb, the gardener and caretaker of George Floyd Square, shared his thoughts on the barricades' removal: \"It's a bittersweet moment. The community came together and built this as a symbol of unity and resistance. But it's important to remember that the fight for justice doesn't end here.\"\n\nOn April 20, 2021, Chauvin was convicted on two counts of murder and one count of manslaughter, receiving a sentence of 22.5 years in prison. The trial of the three other officers involved is forthcoming, with federal indictments handed down against all four. Prosecutors Jerry Blackwell and Steve Schleicher elicited significant testimony from witnesses like Charles McMillian and Darnella Frazier, who captured Floyd's final moments on video, highlighting Chauvin's actions as unacceptable.\n\nMedaria Arradondo, Minneapolis's first Black police chief, testified that Chauvin's actions didn't align with police ethics or values: \"We have a responsibility to ensure that the actions of a few do not define the thousands of officers who serve this community with honor and integrity.\"\n\nThe conviction of Chauvin brought mixed reactions, with some seeing it as justice and others as insufficient given broader systemic issues. Mike Freeman, the Hennepin County Attorney, and Keith Ellison, the Attorney General of Minnesota, both played crucial roles in the trial. Ellison's involvement was seen as a tactical move that brought credibility among progressives.\n\nMinneapolis Police Department Lieutenant Johnny Mercil commented on the significance of the conviction: \"It's a step in the right direction, but it doesn't change the fact that there's still a lot of work to be done to address the systemic issues within law enforcement.\" Richard Zimmerman, head of the Minneapolis Police Department's Homicide Unit, echoed Mercil's sentiments: \"The conviction of Derek Chauvin is a reminder that every officer must uphold the highest standards of conduct and professionalism.\""}

Rittenhouse, an 18-year-old from Antioch, Illinois, is charged with the fatal shooting of two men and wounding another during police brutality protests in Kenosha on Aug. 25, 2020.\n\nThe state's motion, obtained by the Chicago Sun-Times, argues that the evidence is relevant to demonstrate Rittenhouse's \"pattern of behavior\" and his \"pride in violence.\" Prosecutors want to introduce a video from July 1, 2020, showing Rittenhouse striking a teenage girl in Kenosha, as well as photos from January 2021, in which Rittenhouse is seen with members of the Proud Boys, making a white power symbol gesture.\n\nRittenhouse is accused of traveling to Kenosha in response to a call to protect businesses during protests. Black Lives Matter supporters view him as a white supremacist, while some conservatives see him as a symbol for gun rights. Rittenhouse has pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\nAccording to the motion, on July 1, 2020, Rittenhouse and other individuals associated with the Proud Boys \"engaged in violent clashes\" with counter-protesters in Kenosha. A video from that day shows Rittenhouse striking a 17-year-old girl in the head with a skateboard. The motion argues that this incident demonstrates Rittenhouse's willingness to use violence against others.\n\nThe motion also argues that Rittenhouse's association with the Proud Boys is relevant to the case, as it shows his \"pride in violence and affiliation with an extremist group known for engaging in violence.\" The Proud Boys are a right-wing organization that has been labeled as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\nDuring the protests in Kenosha, Rittenhouse allegedly shot and killed Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and wounded Gaige Grosskreutz, 26. Rittenhouse has claimed that he acted in self-defense.\n\nThe trial, which is scheduled to start on Nov. 1, is expected to be highly publicized and controversial. Rittenhouse's defense team has argued that the evidence should not be admitted, as it is not directly related to the charges against Rittenhouse. However, the prosecution argues that the evidence is necessary to provide a complete picture of Rittenhouse's actions and motivations during the protests.\n\nThe introduction of evidence related to Rittenhouse's past violent incident and his alleged association with the Proud Boys is likely to be a contentious issue during the trial. Some observers believe that the evidence will be used to paint Rittenhouse as a violent extremist, while others argue that it is irrelevant to the charges against him.\n\nRegardless of the outcome of the trial, the case is sure to be a flashpoint in the ongoing debate over police brutality, gun rights, and extremist groups in America.\n\nIn the coming days, the Chicago Sun-Times will continue to provide updates on the Kyle Rittenhouse trial and related developments. Stay tuned for further coverage."}

One such case involved a Facebook engineer who tracked down a woman after a vacation dispute.\n\nAccording to the authors, between January 2014 and August 2015, Facebook fired 52 employees for misusing user data. The incident with the engineer and the woman was just one of many reported in the book.\n\nThe engineer in question located the woman by accessing her Facebook data, which included her new hotel's location. The authors write, \"Facebook knew the engineer had gone too far, but it didn't report him to law enforcement.\"\n\nAnother instance involved an engineer who accessed a date's conversations, events, photos, and real-time location after she ceased responding to him. The engineer's actions were discovered during a routine audit.\n\nFacebook granted engineers extensive data access to streamline their work, relying on employee integrity to prevent misuse. A Facebook spokesperson said, \"We have extensive controls in place to prevent and detect misuse of data, and we have zero tolerance for employees who violate our policies.\"\n\nMost cases of misuse involved male engineers accessing women's profiles they were interested in. The authors write, \"Men were more likely to look up women's profiles than vice versa.\"\n\nThe book suggests that Facebook's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, favored data collection growth over privacy. According to Kang and Frenkel, \"Zuckerberg believed that if he could get enough people to share, he could build a powerful network that would eventually make money.\"\n\nZuckerberg became aware of these issues in September 2015, following a presentation by then-chief security officer Alex Stamos. Stamos proposed significantly reducing the number of employees who could access user data, encountering executive resistance.\n\nStamos said, \"There's an enormous amount of power in the tools we have, and we have to be very careful about how we wield that power.\" However, his proposals were met with resistance from executives who believed the restrictions would hinder their work.\n\nThe authors write, \"Zuckerberg and his lieutenants were more focused on growth than on privacy.\" They also note that Facebook's lax approach to data access led to the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018.\n\nIn a statement, a Facebook spokesperson said, \"We have significantly strengthened our data access controls since 2015 to prevent and detect this type of misuse. We've also taken steps to increase transparency and control over the information people share on Facebook.\"\n\nZuckerberg, in an interview with Kang and Frenkel, acknowledged the mistakes made in the past and promised to do better. He said, \"We've made a number of mistakes in the past. But I think we've learned a lot from those mistakes, and we're going to keep working to improve.\""}

This lack of transparency raised questions and sparked criticism.\n\nIn response to these allegations, CNN issued a statement defending Chris Cuomo, stating that he acted \"in accordance with the guidance provided by CNN's medical unit\" and \"as any person would if they were in his situation.\"\n\nChris Cuomo has not personally commented on the allegations, and CNN has not announced any plans for him to take a leave of absence or face disciplinary action.\n\nThe controversy comes at a time when Andrew Cuomo is facing mounting crises, including accusations of sexual harassment from multiple women and criticism over his administration's handling of COVID-19 in nursing homes.\n\nChris Cuomo's interviews with his brother during the pandemic have also drawn criticism for lacking rigorous journalistic scrutiny. Some observers have questioned whether Chris Cuomo went easy on his brother due to their familial relationship.\n\nAn Albany Times-Union report revealed that Andrew Cuomo and Health Commissioner Howard Zucker arranged prioritized testing for Chris Cuomo and his family. The report detailed that family members received multiple home visits for testing, with their samples fast-tracked for results.\n\nAt the time, tests were scarce for the general public, and many were struggling to obtain them due to limited supplies and capacity.\n\nIn response to the allegations, the governor's office denied favoritism, claiming assistance was also provided to the general public, including legislators and reporters.\n\nHowever, critics argue that the governor's office should not have been in a position to make such decisions in the first place, as they had a clear conflict of interest.\n\nThe controversy over Chris Cuomo's testing raises questions about transparency and ethics in journalism, particularly during a time of crisis.\n\nSome media watchdogs have called for Chris Cuomo to recuse himself from covering the Cuomo family and New York politics altogether.\n\nOthers argue that the media should not hold Chris Cuomo to a higher standard than other journalists, who may also have personal connections to people in power.\n\nUltimately, the controversy over Chris Cuomo's testing highlights the importance of transparency and ethical journalism, particularly in times of crisis.

Parler's suspension comes as social media platforms face increased scrutiny over their roles in the spread of misinformation and incitement to violence.\n\nJohn Matze maintains that Parler is not responsible for the actions of its users and argues for the importance of free speech. In a statement on Parler, he said, \"Parler will not be silenced and restrained by forces looking to limit the voices of ordinary Americans.\"\n\nDespite the challenges, Parler's userbase remains committed to the platform.

Black faces two counts of providing a dangerous weapon to someone under 18, resulting in death, with each count potentially carrying a three-year prison sentence.\n\nAnthony Cotton, Black's Waukesha criminal defense attorney, filed a motion to dismiss the charges, arguing that there has been a misinterpretation of the law. \"My client did not violate the law,\" Cotton stated during a virtual hearing in Racine County Circuit Court. \"The law only applies to hunting situations, and there was no hunting involved here.\"\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint, the rifle was purchased for Rittenhouse to use on private property and was stored in Kenosha by Black's stepfather. Rittenhouse used the rifle in August during the unrest in Kenosha to fatally shoot two protesters, Anthony Huber and Joseph Rosenbaum, and wound a third, Gaige Grosskreutz. Rittenhouse claimed self-defense.\n\nWisconsin law prohibits adults from providing firearms to minors, with certain exceptions for supervised activities. However, Cotton argues that the law's exceptions and specifications do not apply in this case. \"The law is clear that it does not apply to this situation,\" Cotton said. \"There was no hunting involved, and there was no supervision. My client did not violate the law.\"\n\nCotton also filed a separate motion challenging the charging of two counts for the same weapon transfer, citing double jeopardy concerns. Judge Bruce Schroeder indicated agreement on the multiplicity issue and will likely issue a ruling in writing by June.\n\nFederal authorities are reportedly considering charges against Black for straw purchasing the rifle, which could result in up to 10 years in prison. \"My client did not violate any federal laws,\" Cotton stated. \"He is a victim in this situation, not a criminal.\"\n\nRittenhouse's trial is scheduled to begin on November 1, 2021, in Kenosha County Circuit Court.\n\nCotton's motion to dismiss the charges comes as Rittenhouse's defense team is also challenging the constitutionality of Wisconsin's self-defense laws. In a motion filed earlier this month, Rittenhouse's attorneys, Mark Richards and Corey Chirafasi, argued that Wisconsin's self-defense laws violate the Second Amendment right to bear arms.\n\n\"The law as written and applied in this case infringes on our client's fundamental right to bear arms for lawful self-defense,\" Richards stated. \"We will continue to fight for Kyle's constitutional rights in the courtroom.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Black remains free on a $5,000 signature bond. His next court appearance is scheduled for May 26.\n\nIn a statement, Cotton reiterated his client's innocence. \"My client did not violate the law,\" Cotton said. \"He is a victim in this situation, not a criminal. We look forward to proving that in court.\"\n\nThe case has garnered national attention, with many viewing Rittenhouse as a symbol of Second Amendment rights and others as a trigger-happy vigilante. The outcome of the case could have significant implications for gun laws and self-defense in Wisconsin and beyond.\n\nAs the legal proceedings continue, both sides are gearing up for what promises to be a contentious and closely watched trial.\n\nCotton concluded, \"We will continue to fight for my client's rights and for the truth to come out in this case.\""}

The suspension came a week after Lindell's personal account was banned from the social media platform.\n\nLindell, a vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump, has long claimed that the presidential election was rigged. The MyPillow CEO's belief in election fraud led him to use the MyPillow account to spread his views and circumvent his personal suspension.\n\nCached tweets show that Lindell used the MyPillow account to post content that violated Twitter's rules, including accusations against Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey of being involved in election fraud.\n\nIn response to the suspension, Lindell expressed disbelief and accused Twitter of attempting to destroy him. He stated, \"They're going to try to destroy everybody they don't like. I'm not going to let them destroy me.\"\n\nTwitter's ban evasion policy prohibits suspended users from operating other accounts to circumvent the ban. The policy aims to prevent users from bypassing suspensions and continuing to violate Twitter's rules.\n\nSeveral retailers, including Kohl's, Bed Bath & Beyond, and J.C. Penney, have ceased selling MyPillow products due to slowing sales. The retailers' decisions came in response to Lindell's controversial statements and actions.\n\nDominion Voting Systems, a target of Lindell's election fraud claims, is considering litigation against the MyPillow CEO for defamation. Dominion is seeking damages for the harm caused to its reputation by Lindell's false claims.\n\nTwitter has banned over 70,000 accounts for spreading misinformation following the U.S. Capitol storming. The platform has taken action against several high-profile accounts, including that of former President Trump.\n\nTrump's account was suspended on January 8, 2021, for violating Twitter's rules regarding the risk of further incitement of violence. The suspension came after Trump's repeated calls to his supporters to march on the Capitol.\n\nLindell's suspension from Twitter marks a significant setback for the MyPillow CEO, who has used the platform to promote his brand and spread his political views.\n\nIn a statement, a Twitter spokesperson said, \"We took enforcement action on the @MyPillowUSA account today for violating the Twitter Rules, specifically for ban evasion.\"\n\nBan evasion occurs when a suspended user creates a new account to circumvent the ban and continue violating Twitter's rules. The policy aims to prevent users from bypassing suspensions and continuing to engage in harmful behavior.\n\nLindell's suspension from Twitter has received widespread attention, with many expressing support for the CEO's right to free speech. Others, however, criticized Lindell for spreading misinformation and contributing to the divisive political climate.\n\nThe MyPillow CEO's suspension from Twitter is just the latest in a series of high-profile suspensions and bans on the platform. The actions by Twitter and other social media companies have sparked debates about free speech, censorship, and the role of technology in shaping public discourse.\n\nAs the situation unfolds, it remains to be seen how Lindell will respond to the suspension and what impact it will have on his personal brand and business. One thing is clear, however: the controversy surrounding Lindell and Twitter is far from over."}

According to Nielsen Media Research, the show drew an average of 1.31 million viewers during the week of March 15, a stark contrast to its 2020 average of 1.8 million viewers. The ratings decline extends to the crucial demographic of adults aged 25-to-54, which is essential for advertisers.\n\nThe downward trend in viewership coincides with a series of scandals surrounding Chris Cuomo's brother, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. The Democratic governor has faced allegations of sexual harassment, verbal threats, and covering up nursing home COVID-19 deaths. A total of five women have accused Gov. Cuomo of unwanted advances, while the New York Attorney General's office is conducting an investigation into the nursing home deaths.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the Cuomo brothers has raised questions about CNN's decision to allow Chris Cuomo to conduct interviews with his brother during the pandemic. Critics argue that CNN's coverage of the scandals lacked impartiality and objectivity, potentially influencing public perception of the situation. CNN responded by announcing that Chris Cuomo would no longer cover his brother's scandals, citing a long-standing rule against coverage of family members.\n\nCNN's ratings decline occurs as it falls behind Fox News in the competitive cable news landscape. According to Nielsen, Fox News averaged 2.5 million viewers during the same week, while MSNBC drew an average of 1.4 million viewers. The ratings gap between the networks is particularly significant in the key demographic of adults aged 25-to-54, with Fox News attracting 415,000 viewers compared to CNN's 175,000 and MSNBC's 161,000.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the Cuomo brothers and CNN's handling of the situation has not gone unnoticed. Republican lawmakers and pundits have accused the network of a clear conflict of interest and called for Chris Cuomo's resignation. Some have even demanded that CNN terminate his contract.\n\nThe situation at CNN is further complicated by the fact that CNN executive vice president Allison Gollust has prior connections to Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Gollust reportedly helped draft a statement for the governor in response to allegations of nursing home COVID-19 deaths cover-up. CNN has maintained that Gollust's involvement in the statement did not impact the network's coverage of the situation.\n\nDespite the mounting pressure, Gov. Andrew Cuomo has refused to resign, insisting that he has the support of the majority of New Yorkers. However, bipartisan calls for his resignation continue to grow, with some Democrats joining the chorus.\n\nAs the situation unfolds, CNN faces a critical juncture.

With over half of its population living in coastal areas, the state's residents are all too familiar with the devastating impacts of these storms. However, as the 2021 hurricane season unfolds, scientists and experts are shedding new light on the critical role that Louisiana's wetlands play in mitigating the impacts of hurricanes.\n\nGerald Galloway, a recently retired engineering professor at the University of Maryland, explained, \"Wetlands act as a natural buffer against storms, absorbing storm surges and reducing wave height.\" He added, \"They are more effective against small to moderate storms, with their effectiveness diminishing in major events like Hurricane Ida.\"\n\nHugh J. Roberts, Chief Operating Officer at The Water Institute of the Gulf, emphasized, \"Wetlands' ability to dissipate storm energy is akin to a cyclist riding over gravel. More robust wetlands provide greater resistance.\" However, once these delicate ecosystems are overwhelmed by water, their ability to slow down waves diminishes significantly.\n\nPhilip B. Bedient, Director of the Center focused on severe storms and flooding at Rice University, weighed in, \"Wetlands play a crucial role in storm protection. They provide a first line of defense against storm surges.\" Ed Link, a researcher at the University of Maryland, agreed, adding, \"Wetlands not only protect against storms but also help in curbing erosion, preserving landscapes, and providing crucial habitat for wildlife and fisheries.\"\n\nAccording to Chuck Perrodin, spokesperson for the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, \"Louisiana's land loss problem has been ongoing since the 1930s, and current restoration efforts are only slowing down the loss, not reversing it.\"\n\nDespite the challenges, Louisiana has been investing heavily in restoring its natural barriers. Since 2007, the state has created or restored significant marshland and barrier island areas. Perrodin stated, \"These efforts are essential for protecting our communities from storms and safeguarding our economy.\"\n\nThe state's coastal protection and restoration plans include projects costing an estimated $50 billion, expected to prevent over $150 billion in damage over five decades.\n\nGalloway explained, \"Restoration of wetlands and barrier islands is a key strategy in Louisiana's storm defense efforts, especially after hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\" He added, \"These storms highlighted the importance of investing in coastal restoration and protection.\"\n\nRoberts continued, \"The Water Institute of the Gulf is committed to researching and implementing effective strategies for wetlands restoration and storm protection.\" He emphasized, \"Our work is supported by research and environmental groups, who recognize the vital role wetlands play in safeguarding our communities and the environment.\"\n\nBedient shared, \"Louisiana's wetlands are a critical component of the state's overall storm defense strategy. They are essential for reducing the impacts of hurricanes and protecting the state's coastal communities.\"\n\nPerrodin acknowledged, \"Restoring Louisiana's wetlands is a long-term effort, but it is essential for the state's future. We cannot afford to ignore this issue any longer.\" He added, \"The costs of inaction would be far greater than the investments we are making in restoration and protection.\"\n\nGalloway emphasized, \"Wetlands are a precious resource that must be protected and restored. They are not only essential for storm defense but also for maintaining the health and productivity of our coastal ecosystems.\"\n\nLink concluded, \"Louisiana's wetlands are a critical piece of the puzzle when it comes to effective storm defense. We must continue to invest in their restoration and protection if we are to safeguard our communities and the environment for future generations.\"\n\nAs the 2021 hurricane season unfolds, the importance of Louisiana's wetlands in storm defense cannot be overstated. These delicate ecosystems play a crucial role in reducing the impacts of hurricanes and protecting the state's communities and economy. The ongoing efforts to restore and protect these vital wetlands will continue to be a top priority for the state and its residents in the years to come.\n\nQuote from Gerald Galloway: \"Wetlands act as a natural buffer against storms, absorbing storm surges and reducing wave height.

It's a matter of systemic biases within the newsroom.\" Studies confirm that missing white individuals receive more and often more favorable media coverage than people of color, perpetuating a troubling cycle.\n\nSocial media and public engagement have the potential to challenge these biases by amplifying neglected cases. Recent coverage of Petito's case might indicate a shift toward more inclusive reporting on missing persons. Yet, without lasting changes in newsroom practices, the pattern of biased coverage is likely to recur. It's high time for media outlets to recognize the importance of inclusive storytelling and to challenge the deeply rooted biases that perpetuate 'missing white woman syndrome.'"}

However, the $1,400 checks fell short of the $2,000 promised by some Democratic leaders before and after the Senate runoff elections in Georgia.\n\nDuring the campaign trail, then-President-elect Biden, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) were among those who championed the cause of $2,000 stimulus payments. \"We're going to put money in the pockets of the American people. $2,000 stimulus checks,\" Biden tweeted on December 30, 2020.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan, however, only authorized $1,400 stimulus checks for individuals and $2,800 for married and joint filers. According to Schumer, \"We're going to deliver relief to the American people. We're going to deliver $1,400 checks to the vast majority of Americans.\"\n\nSome progressive members of the Democratic Party, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Rep. Cori Bush (D-MO), were quick to point out the discrepancy between the promised $2,000 and the delivered $1,400 checks. \"It's a step in the right direction, but not nearly enough,\" Ocasio-Cortez stated.\n\nProposals for providing $2,000 stimulus checks on a monthly basis until the end of the Covid-19 pandemic were met with resistance from both Democrats and Republicans. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) opposed the monthly checks, stating, \"We can't keep giving $2,000 checks every month.\"\n\nThe Biden administration argued that the combination of the second stimulus check of $600 and the third of $1,400 equals $2,000 in total stimulus payments. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki explained, \"The President supports getting relief to the American people as quickly as possible.\"\n\nBiden's acknowledgment of the hesitance of moderate Democrats regarding a $2,000 check was evident when he stated, \"I know some of my Democratic colleagues in the House and Senate prefer a larger number, but I believe this package does far more than any bill before it to help the American people.\"\n\nUnder the conditions laid out in the legislation, a family of four could receive a total of $5,600 in stimulus payments from the third stimulus check. While this is a significant amount, it falls short of the $10,400 a family of four would have received if the $2,000 checks had been approved.\n\nThe debate over the discrepancy between the promised and delivered stimulus checks raises questions about the political implications of unfulfilled campaign promises. Sanders weighed in, stating, \"We made a promise to the American people. We have a responsibility to keep that promise.\"\n\nSome argue that the Biden administration's focus on a stimulus package that could realistically be passed was the right choice, given the political realities of the moment. Manchin explained, \"We have to be realistic about what we can pass and what we can't.\"\n\nAs the dust settles on the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, it's worth examining the promises versus the reality of the stimulus checks. While the $1,400 checks provide much-needed relief, they fall short of the $2,000 promised by some Democratic leaders. The debate raises important questions about the role of promises in politics and the implications of unfulfilled campaign pledges. The readers are left to decide if the \"promise\" was kept.\n\n\"We made a promise to the American people. We have a responsibility to keep that promise.\" - Sen.

Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on January 20, 2021, was awash in the color purple. From Dr. Jill Biden's Ralph Lauren coat to Vice President Harris's purple suit and sari, this regal hue adorned many of the most prominent figures in attendance, including Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton, Laura Bush, Amy Klobuchar, and even former Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nGwendolyn Dubois Shaw, senior historian at the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery, noted, \"The use of the color purple at the inauguration is deeply symbolic, reflecting America's historical ties to monarchy and our collective longing for a sense of royalty and unity.\"\n\nBeyond a fashion statement, the color purple holds significant meaning. It represents royalty and nobility, a nod to the historical monarchies that have influenced American culture. Purple also symbolizes the Purple Heart, an honor bestowed upon military personnel wounded or killed in service.\n\nMoreover, purple signifies unity, blending the traditional red (Republican) and blue (Democratic) colors into a call for bipartisan harmony. Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel \"The Color Purple,\" themed around African American women's struggles, parallels the historic nature of Harris's inauguration as the first woman, the first Black person, and the first South Asian American to hold the position.\n\nGwendolyn Dubois Shaw emphasized, \"The choice of purple at the inauguration sends a powerful message beyond fashion. It symbolizes political unity and social values, offering a response to recent political division and conflict, and a call for national unity.\"\n\nHistorian Gwendolyn Dubois Shaw highlighted the deep-rooted significance of purple in American democracy and royalty. \"Purple has long held a special place in American culture and politics,\" she said. \"From the Purple Heart to the robes of Supreme Court justices, the color has represented honor, wisdom, and unity.\"\n\nThe inauguration's purple theme stands in stark contrast to the red hats symbolizing the previous administration, representing a clear call for change and a renewed commitment to national unity. As America moves forward, the symbolism of the color purple will continue to resonate, serving as a reminder of our shared history, values, and aspirations.\n\nGwendolyn Dubois Shaw concluded, \"The use of purple at the inauguration is a powerful reminder of our collective past, present, and future.

Bush administration in 2001. His appointment was seen as a welcome addition, bringing a judicious viewpoint and a tradition of pragmatic internationalism to the table. Powell's strategic philosophy, known as the Powell Doctrine, would leave a lasting impact on U.S. foreign policy.\n\nThe Powell Doctrine emphasized the cautious use of U.S. military force. According to Richard J. Pierce Jr., a scholar at the George Washington University, \"The Powell Doctrine called for overwhelming force, clear objectives, a reasonable chance of success, a defined exit strategy, and strong allied support.\"\n\nSeth Jones, a military expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, explains, \"The Powell Doctrine was a strategic philosophy aimed at minimizing U.S. casualties and maximizing the likelihood of success in military interventions.\"\n\nRetired Marine Gen. Anthony Zinni, former head of U.S. Central Command, recalls, \"Colin Powell believed that military action should be a last resort and that diplomacy and economic measures should always be exhausted first.\"\n\nHowever, the Bush administration's unilateral actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, which lacked clear objectives and exit plans, contrasted sharply with the Powell Doctrine. Then-Senator Chuck Hagel, a Vietnam veteran, expressed his concerns, stating, \"We went into Iraq without clear objectives, without a defined exit strategy, and without sufficient allied support.\"\n\nDonald Rumsfeld, the Defense Secretary at the time, held a different perspective. He aimed to overcome the perceived limitations and self-criticism that followed the Vietnam War, and believed that a more assertive approach was necessary. Rumsfeld argued, \"We cannot allow the past to dictate our actions in the present.\"\n\nThe recent U.S. military engagements and withdrawals, particularly from Afghanistan, reflect a renewed interest in Powellian restraint. As Pierce notes, \"The Powell Doctrine's emphasis on clear objectives, defined exit strategies, and allied support is becoming increasingly relevant in today's complex security environment.\"\n\nCritics argue that adherence to the Powell Doctrine could have prevented the costly and protracted conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Jones asserts, \"If the Powell Doctrine had been followed more closely, we might have avoided the quagmires in Iraq and Afghanistan.\"\n\nThe Powell Doctrine was influenced by Powell's Vietnam War experience. Zinni recalls, \"Colin Powell's experience in Vietnam shaped his views on military engagement. He believed that military action should be a last resort and that diplomacy and economic measures should always be exhausted first.\"\n\nThe debate over military action often split between those with Vietnam War experience, who were more cautious, and those without, who were more aggressive. Powell's warnings and principles, particularly the 'Pottery Barn' rule – \"If you break it, you own it\" – may now be gaining renewed relevance amid reflections on recent U.S. military interventions. As Pierce concludes, \"The Powell Doctrine serves as a reminder of the importance of careful consideration before engaging in military action.\""}

The agreement was solidified through a letter of agreement between U.S. and UAE officials, detailing the sale's terms.\n\nThe specifics of the deal, including cost and technical specifications, were established, but the first delivery date, potentially in 2027, remains unconfirmed. The sale is valued at approximately $23.37 billion and encompasses aircraft, drones, and a wide array of munitions.\n\nFuture negotiations could adjust the financial details of the agreement, particularly with Lockheed Martin and General Atomics, the manufacturers of the F-35 and MQ-9, respectively. The Biden administration's stance on the deal is unclear, though it has expressed intentions to review it carefully.\n\nAntony Blinken, Biden's nominee for Secretary of State, emphasized the need to maintain Israel's qualitative military edge when considering the sale during his confirmation hearing. This concern stems from Israel's longstanding agreement with the U.S. to ensure its military superiority in the region.\n\nThe U.S. Senate failed to block the sale in December, with votes showing a partisan split favoring the deal. Senator Bob Menendez (D-NJ), the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, criticized the sale, arguing that it could harm U.S. efforts to de-escalate tensions in the Middle East.\n\nRequests for comments from the Departments of State and Defense went unanswered. The F-35 sale to the UAE was one of several major defense deals finalized during the waning days of the Trump administration, including a deal to sell advanced weapons to Taiwan.\n\nThe F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is a multirole, fifth-generation combat aircraft that provides enhanced survivability and improved lethality. It is designed to conduct a range of ground-attack and air-to-air missions. The MQ-9 Reaper is an unmanned aerial vehicle used for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions, as well as for precision strike missions. The UAE currently operates a fleet of Predator drones, and the acquisition of the MQ-9 Reaper represents a significant upgrade in capabilities."}

This move comes as the administration increases pressure on tech companies to combat the spread of misinformation more effectively.\n\nWhite House Communications Director, Kate Bedingfield, emphasized the importance of holding social media companies accountable for their role in disseminating false information. During a press briefing, she stated, \"The President believes that accountability is essential when it comes to social media companies, and that they have a responsibility to address misinformation on their platforms.\"\n\nThe debate over Section 230 has intensified as the administration pushes tech giants to take a more active stance against misinformation. President Joe Biden himself has weighed in on the issue, acknowledging the collective effort needed to combat false information. \"We can't just rely on content creators to be responsible,\" he said during a recent press conference. \"It's a collective effort.\"\n\nBoth Biden and his predecessor, Donald Trump, have criticized Section 230, albeit for different reasons. Trump sought to alter its application through executive orders, which were deemed unconstitutional by legal experts and FCC officials. In contrast, Biden's concerns revolve around the need for greater accountability from social media companies.\n\nDespite bipartisan agreement on the need to regulate Big Tech, Congress holds the power to amend Section 230. However, the complexities of the issue and the potential for unintended consequences have made legislative action challenging.\n\nTensions between the White House and Facebook have risen in recent days, with Biden publicly criticizing the platform for not doing enough to stop the spread of misinformation. In response to a question about Facebook's role in the COVID-19 vaccine misinformation crisis, the President stated, \"They're killing people.\" He later retracted the statement, acknowledging that it was not an accurate characterization.\n\nSenior officials are now in direct contact with Facebook as tensions continue to escalate. The discussions center around the platform's handling of misinformation, particularly regarding vaccines. According to a report by the Center for Countering Digital Hate, Facebook is responsible for 60% of anti-vaccine content on social media.\n\nIn a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki urged the tech giant to address the issue, stating, \"The American people deserve transparency from Facebook about how it is ensuring the safety of its users, particularly as we work to increase vaccinations and save lives.\"\n\nAs the debate over Section 230 and social media accountability continues, it remains to be seen how the White House and tech companies will navigate this complex issue. One thing is certain: the pressure on social media platforms to combat misinformation shows no signs of abating."}

Once a key instigator of the May Day protests and a member of the Chicago Seven, Davis claimed that activism had failed and introduced the concept of divine leadership through Guru Maharaj Ji as a solution to global issues like war, poverty, and racism.\n\nFrank Joyce, a fellow 1960s activist, expressed his disillusionment, stating, \"It was a shock to see Rennie, a man who had been at the forefront of political activism, embrace a spiritual leader.\"\n\nDavis's transition to spiritual advocacy led to mixed reactions among the activist community. Jay Craven, an activist and filmmaker, felt betrayed by Davis's sudden change of heart, stating, \"Rennie's involvement with Guru Maharaj Ji and the Divine Light Mission felt like a betrayal to those of us who had fought alongside him in the streets.\"\n\nHowever, not all reactions were negative. Ted Morgan, a journalist who covered the antiwar movement extensively, observed, \"Davis's newfound spirituality was intriguing to many. They saw it as a new approach to addressing the root causes of social issues.\"\n\nDavis's involvement with Guru Maharaj Ji's Divine Light Mission marked a significant shift from his previous political work to a focus on personal and global transformation through spirituality. Stephen A. Kent, a sociologist who studied the Divine Light Mission, explained, \"Davis believed that inner transformation was essential to bring about societal transformation, and that spiritual enlightenment could lead to a 'new humanity'.\"\n\nThroughout the 1970s, many former activists turned to mystical religions and inner change as a means to effect social change. Davis was not alone in his quest for spiritual enlightenment, as other prominent activists, such as Allen Ginsberg and Timothy Leary, also explored spiritual and New Age practices during this time.\n\nDespite the controversies and shifts in focus, Davis remained proud of his political activism and continued to promote a vision of a transformational revolution that combined inward and outward focus. In his later years, Davis devoted himself to teaching meditation and building a 'new humanity' movement with his third wife, Ma Devi.\n\nDavis passed away in 2021 from lymphoma, still advocating for a transformational revolution in his book 'The New Humanity'. His legacy continues to inspire those who believe that personal and spiritual growth are essential to creating a more peaceful and just world. Reflecting on Davis's life and work, Jay Craven shared, \"Rennie's journey shows us that transformation is a lifelong process, and that even the most radical activists can evolve and grow in unexpected ways.\""}

Alec Baldwin, the film's leading actor, fatally shot cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and wounded director Joel Souza during a rehearsal with a prop firearm.\n\nMamie Mitchell, the script supervisor on the set, recounted the chaotic scene, stating, \"I ran out and saw chair dollys [sic] and coffee cups and breakfast burritos all over the ground. People were crying, screaming. I saw Halyna lying on the ground, her head in a pool of blood.\"\n\nBefore the shooting, a camera crew had walked off the set in protest of safety conditions. \"Safety was an ongoing issue since the beginning of filming,\" said Joel Souza, the film's director. \"There were concerns about working conditions, accommodations, and gun safety specifically.\"\n\nAssistant director Dave Halls, who handed Baldwin the gun, mistakenly declared it as a \"cold gun,\" indicating it was safe for use. However, the weapon was loaded with a live round, which ultimately led to the fatal incident.\n\nThe Santa Fe-area District Attorney, Mary Carmack-Altwies, confirmed that the investigation into the incident would focus on gun safety protocols. \"The question is how did a live round get into that gun?\" she stated.\n\nHalyna Hutchins' husband, Matthew Hutchins, expressed his grief and called for increased safety measures in the film industry. \"Our hearts go out to the family of Halyna Hutchins and to Joel Souza and all involved in the incident on 'Rust,'\" he said.\n\nLiz Pecos, President of IATSE Local 480, the union representing the film's set workers, emphasized the importance of implementing proper safety measures. \"This is a wake-up call for the industry,\" she stated. \"We need stricter regulations and more resources dedicated to ensuring the safety of all crew members on set.\"\n\nPrevious accidental discharges of firearms on set had raised concerns among crew members. \"There were instances where weapons were accidentally discharged during rehearsals,\" Joel Souza shared. \"But we were always assured that proper safety protocols were in place.\"\n\nThe film's armorer, Hannah Gutierrez, had recently assumed her role and expressed initial nervousness about her readiness. \"I felt I was set up for failure from the beginning,\" she stated in an interview. \"I wasn't given enough time or resources to properly prepare for the job.\"\n\nFollowing the incident, production on \"Rust\" was halted, with the film industry expressing collective grief and calling for better safety measures. \"This tragedy underscores the importance of adhering to strict safety protocols on film sets,\" stated a spokesperson for the International Film & Television Alliance.\n\nThe incident has reignited discussions around on-set gun safety protocols and comparisons have been drawn to past on-set shootings, such as the fatal shooting of Brittany Murphy in 2009 and the injury of Harrison Ford in 1995.\n\nAs the investigation into the \"Rust\" incident continues, the film industry awaits the outcome with a renewed focus on implementing stronger safety measures.

Ransomware attacks, in which hackers seize control of data or systems and demand payment for their return, surged in 2020, costing victims in the United States nearly $350 million, a 311% increase from the previous year, according to a report by Cybersecurity Ventures.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray highlighted the alarming trend, stating, \"The volume of ransomware payments has tripled over the last year.\" In an interview with Reuters, Wray added, \"It's a huge enterprise for organized crime, and it's growing.\"\n\nExperts attribute the surge in attacks to the increased use of virtual private networks (VPNs) and the vulnerabilities that come with remote work. John Hammond, a cybersecurity researcher at Huntress, explained, \"Ransomware attacks are becoming more successful due to the shift to remote work. Attackers are finding vulnerabilities in home networks, and VPNs are an easy target.\"\n\nIsrael Barak, the Chief Information Security Officer at Cybereason, agreed, \"Remote work has expanded the attack surface, making it easier for hackers to breach networks and deploy ransomware.\"\n\nThe consequences of these attacks can be severe. In May 2021, the Colonial Pipeline, a major fuel supplier to the East Coast, was forced to shut down after a ransomware attack. The breach of the company's virtual private network was attributed to the attack.\n\nRahul Telang, a professor of information systems at Carnegie Mellon, explained, \"Corporate and government security measures are less effective when devices are used outside of controlled networks.\"\n\nJoseph Carson, the Chief Security Scientist at Thycotic, added, \"The rise of cryptocurrency facilitates ransomware attacks by making payments easier and less traceable.\"\n\nThe threat of ransomware attacks has not gone unnoticed by the Biden administration. In a letter to corporate executives, Anne Neuberger, the Cybersecurity Adviser at the National Security Council, emphasized the need for improved cybersecurity measures, stating, \"Ransomware poses a grave threat to public health and safety, economic security, and national security.\"\n\nThe House homeland security committee has advanced multiple bills aimed at enhancing cybersecurity. John Katko, the committee's ranking Republican, said, \"These bills will help bolster our cybersecurity defenses and protect against the growing threat of ransomware attacks.\"\n\nChristopher Wray weighed in on the legislative efforts, \"Congress is taking important steps to address the ransomware threat, and we're encouraged by their efforts.\"\n\nThe FBI director also urged individuals and organizations to take steps to protect themselves against ransomware attacks. Wray advised, \"Ensure your software is up to date, use strong passwords, and be wary of phishing emails and other social engineering tactics.\"\n\nJohn Hammond offered additional advice, \"Implement multi-factor authentication, use a reputable VPN, and invest in cybersecurity training for your employees.\"\n\nIsrael Barak emphasized the importance of incident response planning, \"Have a plan in place for responding to a ransomware attack, and practice it regularly.\"\n\nRahul Telang warned, \"Ransomware attacks are not going away anytime soon. Organizations need to invest in robust cybersecurity measures to protect themselves and their customers.\"\n\nAs the threat of ransomware continues to evolve, it's clear that individuals and organizations must remain vigilant and proactive in their cybersecurity efforts. By following best practices and staying informed about the latest threats, we can all help reduce the impact of ransomware attacks and protect against the financial and reputational damage they can cause."}

Howard missed the majority of the 2020 Super Bowl-winning season due to a devastating Achilles rupture. However, the injury coincided with a significant personal milestone – the birth of his daughter, Caliana Mia Howard.\n\n\"It was a tough pill to swallow, missing the season and not being able to contribute to the team,\" Howard said during a recent interview. \"But having my daughter, Caliana, during that time really helped me get through it.\"\n\nHoward's injury came during a Week 5 matchup against the Los Angeles Chargers. He described the moment as feeling like a \"kick\" on his leg.\n\n\"I was just trying to make a play, and then all of a sudden, I felt this strange sensation in my leg,\" Howard recalled. \"I knew something was wrong, but I didn't realize it was an Achilles rupture until the doctors told me.\"\n\nDespite the setback, Howard had been having the best start to a season in his career before getting hurt. He had caught 13 passes for 191 yards and two touchdowns in the first five games.\n\n\"It was frustrating to have that kind of start and then get injured,\" Howard admitted. \"But I tried to stay positive and focus on my recovery.\"\n\nChanel Sideboard, Howard's girlfriend, shared her perspective on the situation.\n\n\"It was a difficult time for both of us,\" Sideboard said. \"But O.J. remained strong, and having our daughter gave us something to focus on other than the injury.\"\n\nHoward comes from a large family in Prattville, Ala., where children are always present.

These individuals often lacked the necessary direct deposit information for the IRS to distribute the payments electronically.\n\nTo help eligible individuals claim their missed payments, the Treasury Department is tasked with creating online tools and outreach efforts. The IRS launched an online non-filer tool last year for those who did not file a tax return in 2018 or 2019. However, as of last fall, IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig reported that 8 million eligible people had not used the portal.\n\n\"The IRS Non-Filer Sign-Up Tool has been available since May 2020, and I encourage anyone who hasn't received a payment and hasn't filed a tax return for 2019 to use it,\" Rettig said in a statement at the time.\n\nSamantha Jacoby, senior tax legal analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, praised the administration's focus on assisting low-income individuals who missed payments.\n\n\"This is a significant step forward in ensuring that millions of low-income families who were left out of the first round of stimulus checks will finally receive the financial assistance they need during this crisis,\" Jacoby said in a statement.\n\nThe executive order is part of Biden's broader efforts to provide financial relief during the pandemic. The American Rescue Plan Act, signed into law in March, includes provisions for a third round of stimulus checks worth up to $1,400 for eligible individuals.\n\nHowever, the number of Americans who missed out on stimulus checks could be even higher than 8 million. A report from the Government Accountability Office found that as many as 16 million people could have been eligible for the first round of payments but did not receive them.\n\nIn a statement, the White House emphasized the importance of ensuring all entitled Americans receive their stimulus checks.\n\n\"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose significant economic challenges for the American people, and the President remains committed to ensuring that every eligible American receives the financial assistance they are entitled to,\" the statement read.\n\nThe Treasury Department did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on the details of the executive order."}

The U.S. Senate vote was 57 to convict and 43 to acquit, falling short of the two-thirds needed for conviction.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) expressed disappointment over the outcome, implying that Republican senators prioritized their loyalty to Trump over the country's wellbeing. \"The Senate voted to let President Trump off the hook,\" Schumer said. \"Each senator who voted to acquit President Trump bears responsibility for that failure.\"\n\nLead House impeachment manager Jamie Raskin (D-MD) argued during the trial that Trump had incited the violence on January 6 through his false claims about election fraud. \"This was an attack on the rule of law,\" Raskin stated during closing arguments.\n\nOne of Trump's lawyers, Michael van der Veen, denied the incitement charge, claiming Trump's speech was protected under the First Amendment and dismissing the trial as political theatre. \"President Trump did not incite this attack,\" van der Veen asserted.\n\nRepublican Representative Jaime Herrera Beutler, one of ten House Republicans who voted for impeachment, criticized her colleagues who voted to acquit. \"The evidence is compelling,\" Herrera Beutler stated in a statement. \"President Trump's actions on January 6th were a betrayal of his oath of office, and a betrayal to the American people.\"\n\nPro-Trump Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) celebrated the acquittal, tweeting, \"Justice has been served!\"\n\nTrump himself labeled the trial as \"the greatest witch hunt in the history of our Country.\" In a statement, he expressed gratitude to the senators who \"stood up against the Witch Hunt.\"\n\nThe trial, lasting five days, was the fastest presidential impeachment trial in U.S. history. Democrats argued that Trump's actions on January 6 had threatened American democracy, while Republicans maintained that the trial was politically motivated.\n\nThe outcome of the trial further highlighted the deep divisions within the Republican Party. Pro-Trump lawmakers praised the acquittal, while those advocating for accountability expressed frustration and disappointment.\n\nFollowing the acquittal, Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY), the Minority Leader, released a statement acknowledging that Trump had been \"practically and morally responsible\" for the January 6 attack. However, McConnell voted to acquit, citing constitutional concerns.\n\nSchumer concluded, \"President Trump's actions on January 6th were a betrayal of his oath of office, and a betrayal to the American people.

This is a sad day for the United States Senate, for the United States Congress, and for the United States of America.\"\n\nThe acquittal of Donald Trump in his second impeachment trial marks a significant moment in U.S. political history. The divisions within the Republican Party, as well as the continued debate over the significance of the events of January 6, are likely to persist."}

In August 2021, California became the first state in the nation to introduce mandatory vaccinations for healthcare workers and school attendance requirements.\n\nCalifornia has also partnered with over 830 faith-based and community organizations to improve vaccination equity and outreach. \"Our state's diverse communities have been hit hardest by this pandemic, and it's essential that we work together to ensure everyone has access to the resources they need to stay safe and healthy,\" said Governor Newsom.\n\nAs the Omicron variant continues to spread, the state has updated its guidance to include universal indoor mask mandates regardless of vaccination status and updated mega event and travel advisories. \"The science is clear: vaccines and boosters are our best defense against this virus,\" added Governor Newsom. \"COVID-19 vaccines and boosters are free for all Californians, regardless of insurance or immigration status. I urge all eligible Californians to get vaccinated and receive booster shots as soon as possible.\"\n\nGovernor Newsom's message was echoed by California State Public Health Officer and Director Dr. Tomás J. Aragón: \"Vaccines and boosters are the most effective tools we have to protect ourselves, our loved ones, and our communities from COVID-19. I encourage everyone who is eligible to get vaccinated and boosted as soon as possible. Together, we can continue to slow the spread of this virus and save lives.\""}

Lindsey Graham (R-SC) has vowed to remove the legal protections that shield tech companies like Twitter from lawsuits, following the permanent ban of former President Donald Trump's account.\n\nGraham expressed his determination during an interview on Fox News Sunday, criticizing Twitter's decision to silence Trump's voice, comparing it to the Ayatollah's ability to tweet despite being a foreign leader known for human rights abuses.\n\n\"Twitter is making a judgment that they're smarter than the United States government as to who should be allowed to speak and who shouldn't,\" Graham said during the interview. \"I find that amazing.\"\n\nGraham went on to call out \"Big Tech\" for having \"absolute immunity from being sued,\" a protection provided by Congress through Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. He advocated for the repeal of this section to place tech companies on the same legal footing as other companies.\n\nTwitter banned Trump's account on January 8, 2021, citing two tweets that violated its policies against glorifying violence. One of Trump's tweets announced he would not attend Joe Biden's inauguration, which Twitter interpreted as potentially encouraging violent acts. The other tweet, which contained the phrase \"American Patriots,\" was claimed by Twitter to be support for those committing violent acts at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nTwitter also mentioned concerns about future armed protests and a proposed attack on the U.S. Capitol and state capitol buildings as reasons for the ban. Trump's account was locked following the riot at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, which some attribute to his rhetoric.\n\nTrump's tweets read as follows:\n\n  1. \"I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th.\"\n  2. \"Statements made about the election, the violence, and the safety and security of the Capitol were reckless, chaotic, harmful, and dangerous. They must be addressed.\"\n\nTwitter's decision was met with controversy, with some arguing that the former president's words were protected under the First Amendment, while others believed the platform was within its rights to enforce its own policies.\n\nGraham's stance on Section 230 is not new, as he introduced the Ending Support for Internet Censorship Act in 2019, which aimed to repeal the legal shield. He has long argued that tech companies should be held accountable for the content they allow on their platforms and that the current legal framework provides them with too much power and immunity."}

The payments, which follow the initial round from the CARES Act in March 2020, aim to provide financial relief to millions of Americans affected by the ongoing pandemic.\n\nMark Steber, the chief tax information officer at Jackson Hewitt, shared his insights on the rollout, \"The IRS has begun processing the second round of Economic Impact Payments. Direct deposits have started and will continue into the week, while paper checks began mailing on December 30 for those without bank information on file.\"\n\nMany recipients are eagerly awaiting the arrival of their checks but are uncertain about the exact timeline due to the IRS' \"Get My Payment\" website being temporarily offline. Steber reassured, \"The Get My Payment tool is expected to resume operation next week, also tracking both the first and second stimulus payments.\"\n\nThe first round of stimulus checks, authorized under the CARES Act, faced various issues, most notably delayed payments for those without bank account information on file. This time around, the IRS will distribute funds using the same methods - direct deposit, paper check, and prepaid debit card - based on the information available from the 2019 tax return or from recipients who received certain government benefits or used the Non-Filers tool by November 21, 2020.\n\nAutomatic payments will be made to approximately 160 million people who are eligible, according to IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig. The payments are not taxable and recipients are advised to keep IRS Notice 1444 for any additional amounts due on their 2020 tax return.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked a vote to increase the stimulus checks to $2,000, as requested by President Trump, which could complicate the situation for some recipients. Steber acknowledged, \"The second stimulus allows more people to be eligible than the first round, including mixed-status households previously denied under the CARES Act.\"\n\nMark Steber, Jackson Hewitt: \"The IRS has begun processing the second round of Economic Impact Payments. Direct deposits have started and will continue into the week, while paper checks began mailing on December 30 for those without bank information on file.\"\n\nSteber further elaborated on the eligibility criteria, \"Eligible individuals will receive $600, while families will receive an additional $600 for each qualifying child. Eligibility is based on adjusted gross income of $75,000 or less for individuals and $150,000 or less for married couples filing jointly. The payments phase out for individuals with income above these thresholds and are completely phased out for single filers with incomes exceeding $87,000 and $174,000 for married filing jointly.\"\n\nDespite the initial uncertainty, the IRS and the Treasury Department are working diligently to distribute the payments as quickly as possible. Recipients are encouraged to check the Get My Payment tool next week for updates on the status of their payments.\n\nMark Steber, Jackson Hewitt: \"The Get My Payment tool is expected to resume operation next week, also tracking both the first and second stimulus payments.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the second round of stimulus checks marks a significant step towards providing financial assistance to millions of Americans impacted by the ongoing pandemic.

Rodgers sought an exemption from the NFL's COVID-19 protocols based on his antibody levels but was denied.\n\nThe NFL-NFL Players Association (NFLPA) COVID-19 protocols outline that one could be considered fully vaccinated with one shot, provided specific antibody levels are met. According to sources, Rodgers has not received any COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\"Aaron Rodgers asked for an exemption based on a positive test for COVID-19 antibodies, but the NFL, NFLPA, and infectious disease consultant all denied it,\" Rapoport reported on Thursday.\n\nRodgers' non-vaccinated status subjects him to various restrictions, including daily testing and mandatory mask-wearing.\n\nPackers head coach Matt LaFleur declined to comment on Rodgers' vaccination status during a Thursday press conference, directing questions to Rodgers himself.\n\n\"I don't really have any updates on that,\" LaFleur said. \"Obviously, we'll have Jordan Love ready to go, and we'll move forward with that.\"\n\nRodgers cannot rejoin the team until Nov. 13, the day before their Week 10 game against the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nGarafolo reported that Rodgers underwent homeopathic treatment to raise his antibody levels, which the NFL, NFLPA, and infectious disease consultant did not recognize as valid protection.\n\n\"Aaron Rodgers has been undergoing homeopathic treatments to try to boost his antibody levels, but those are not recognized by the NFL, NFLPA, or infectious disease consultants as valid protection,\" Garafolo tweeted on Thursday.\n\nThe news comes as a shock to Packers fans and the NFL community, as Rodgers had previously downplayed the severity of COVID-19 and his need for vaccination.\n\n\"I've been immunized,\" Rodgers told Pat McAfee during an interview on his podcast in August. \"I've had COVID, I've had it before. I currently don't have it. I'm ready to try to continue to spread the facts about immunity and what's going on in the world.\"\n\nIn a statement released Thursday, Rodgers said he was \"disappointed\" by the positive test result but would follow the league's protocols.\n\n\"I'm disappointed for my teammates, for our organization, and for our fans,\" Rodgers said. \"I'm going to get back to work and prepare to play as soon as I'm cleared to do so.\"\n\nThe Packers will face the Chiefs on Sunday at Arrowhead Stadium without their star quarterback.

Amanda Chase Suspended from Facebook for Praising Capitol Rioters, Alleges Silencing of Trump Supporters\n\nVirginia State Sen. Amanda Chase (R-Chesterfield), a vocal supporter of President Donald Trump and self-proclaimed \"Trump in heels,\" was suspended from Facebook for seven days and had live video capabilities restricted for 60 days, following her praise of the rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol and unfounded accusations of left-wing involvement.\n\nChase's suspension comes as part of a broader crackdown on social media accounts inciting violence, with President Trump's permanent suspension from Twitter and Facebook following the Capitol riots on January 6. In a statement, Facebook flagged several of Chase's posts as \"False information,\" including claims about antifa infiltration among Trump supporters.\n\nThe Virginia State Senate's Democratic Caucus swiftly called for Chase's resignation, accusing her of empowering a failed coup d'etat. \"Senator Chase's actions were not only a disgrace to the Virginia Senate but a threat to our democracy,\" said Sen. Dick Saslaw (D-Fairfax), the Senate Democratic leader.\n\nChase, however, dismissed the criticism from Virginia Democrats and accused them of \"committing treason\" by easing voting restrictions. In response to her suspension, she claimed that the action was part of a concerted effort by the \"liberal left\" to silence Trump supporters.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Capitol riots, Chase called for President Trump to declare martial law to prevent his removal from office. Her controversial statements have long been a source of contention within her own party, with the Senate Republican Caucus, which she left in 2019, declining to comment on the situation.\n\nChase's Facebook account, which boasts over 45,000 followers, has been a platform for her incendiary rhetoric. In the days leading up to the Capitol riots, she posted a series of messages supporting Trump and expressing her belief in the need for a \"revolution.\" On January 6, she shared a video on Facebook Live of herself at the Capitol grounds, where she could be heard cheering on the pro-Trump mob.\n\nFollowing the violence at the Capitol, Chase continued to defend the rioters, referring to them as \"patriots\" and insisting that they were acting in the name of democracy. In a post on her Facebook page, she wrote, \"I support the right to peaceably assemble and protest our election results. I was there to support my President and my fellow Americans.\"\n\nChase's actions have drawn widespread condemnation, not only from Democratic officials but also from within her own party. State Sen. Siobhan Dunnavant (R-Henrico), a close ally of Chase, issued a statement distancing herself from the senator's comments. \"I unequivocally condemn the violence that transpired at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021,\" she said.\n\nDespite the backlash, Chase remains unapologetic. In a statement to The Washington Post, she doubled down on her support for the president and her belief in the need for action to address what she perceives as election fraud. \"I will continue to fight for transparency and accountability in our election process,\" she said.\n\nChase's suspension from Facebook is just the latest in a series of consequences she has faced for her incendiary statements. In October 2020, she was stripped of her committee assignments following her participation in a protest against Governor Ralph Northam's COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nAs the fallout from the Capitol riots continues, it remains to be seen how Chase's fellow Republicans will respond to her actions. Some have already distanced themselves from her, while others have remained silent. Regardless of the outcome, one thing is clear: Amanda Chase's inflammatory rhetoric and support for the Capitol rioters have brought her unprecedented attention, both within Virginia and beyond.\n\nIn the days following her Facebook suspension, Chase took to other social media platforms, including Parler, to continue her messages of support for Trump and her criticisms of the Democratic party. Her actions have raised concerns about the potential for further violence and the role social media platforms play in shaping public discourse.\n\nAs the nation grapples with the aftermath of the Capitol riots and the fallout from the 2020 election, the situation in Virginia serves as a reminder of the deep divisions that continue to plague American politics. For Amanda Chase and her supporters, the battle for control of the narrative is far from over.\n\nIn conclusion, the suspension of Virginia State Sen. Amanda Chase's Facebook account for seven days and the restriction of her live video capabilities for 60 days follows her praise of Capitol rioters and unfounded accusations of left-wing involvement. Democrats have called for her resignation, while she alleges a silencing of Trump supporters. Facebook flagged several of her posts as false information. Chase has been a controversial figure within her party, known for her inflammatory rhetoric and calls for martial law. The Senate Republican Caucus, which she left in 2019, declined to comment on the situation. The suspension is just the latest consequence Chase has faced for her incendiary statements. The aftermath of the Capitol riots continues to raise concerns about the potential for further violence and the role social media platforms play in shaping public discourse."}

The company, however, did not specify the cause of the problem.\n\nThe disruption was not related to malware, Colonial Pipeline said in a statement, adding that its network functionality had returned to normal.\n\nThe issue affected Colonial Pipeline's shipping nomination system, which in turn impacted shippers' ability to enter and update delivery nominations, the company said.\n\nThird-party company Transport4 (T4), which operates the shipping nomination system for Colonial Pipeline, reported that its application was functioning normally for all customers and carriers.\n\nThe incident follows a recent ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline that significantly disrupted fuel delivery in the southeast United States. About 6,000 gas stations in the region were still without fuel as a result of the earlier disruption.\n\nGasoline prices have risen to the highest in seven years, partly due to the hack and the onset of the Memorial Day weekend, the busiest U.S. holiday travel period.\n\nThe Colonial Pipeline system, which transports about 2.5 million barrels of gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and other petroleum products daily, was hit by the ransomware attack on May 7. The company shut down its entire system to contain the attack and restore it from backups.\n\nColonial Pipeline restarted some pipeline segments earlier this month, but it took longer than expected for the company to return to normal operations. The pipeline's return to service was delayed due to logistical challenges in getting fuel to where it was needed, the company said.\n\nCybersecurity experts warned that the Colonial Pipeline attack was likely to embolden other hackers to target critical infrastructure, including energy and water systems.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Energy said it was monitoring the situation closely and was in contact with Colonial Pipeline to provide any assistance needed.\n\nThe Colonial Pipeline attack was the most significant cyber attack on a U.S. energy company to date and highlighted the vulnerabilities of the country's critical infrastructure to cyber threats.\n\nColonial Pipeline said it was working to improve its cybersecurity defenses and was investing in new technologies to better protect its systems. The company did not disclose the ransom demand or whether it had paid any ransom to the hackers.\n\nThe incident underscored the importance of robust cybersecurity defenses for critical infrastructure operators and the need for greater collaboration between the public and private sectors to prevent and respond to cyber attacks."}

The prosecution's team, led by a diverse and deep roster of lawyers, stands in stark contrast to the defense's solitary figure, with Assistant Attorney General Erin Eldridge, Jerry Blackwell, Matthew Frank, and Steve Schleicher spearheading the effort to prove that Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer, is guilty of the second-degree murder and manslaughter of George Floyd.\n\nJoseph Daly, an emeritus professor at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law in St. Paul, Minnesota, noted, \"The prosecution's team is significant because it shows the resources and commitment to ensuring a fair and thorough trial in a high-profile case.\"\n\nTen more lawyers are working behind the scenes, many of whom are volunteering their services. This large number of prosecutors is seen as evidence of the trial's significance but carries the risk of preventing jurors from forming a personal connection with the legal team.\n\nIn his opening statement, Jerry Blackwell, a prominent Black civil rights attorney, addressed the racial tensions inherent in the case and utilized his ability to simplify legal jargon, stating, \"The use of force here was not justified. It was not reasonable. It was not necessary. It was not called for under the law.\"\n\nAssistant Attorney General Erin Eldridge, who was chosen to question younger witnesses, utilized cultural perceptions of women as more empathetic, especially towards children. Speaking to the media, Eldridge shared, \"Children are particularly vulnerable witnesses, and I bring a unique perspective as a woman and a mother.\"\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz appointed Attorney General Keith Ellison to oversee the prosecution, highlighting the high stakes of the trial. John Stiles, spokesman for Attorney General Ellison, stated, \"We have a responsibility to seek justice for George Floyd and his family.

Despite Nelson's solitary position, he can consult with 11 other attorneys from the association's legal team.\n\nSue McGraugh, a professor at St. Louis University School of Law, addressed the disparity in courtroom support between the prosecution and defense, stating, \"It's not uncommon for high-profile cases to have larger teams on the prosecution side, but it's important to remember that the defendant is entitled to a fair trial as well.\"\n\nJonathan Simon, a professor at the University of California Berkeley School of Law, noted, \"The prosecution's team size underscores the significance of this case, but it also raises questions about the resources available to defendants in similar situations.\"\n\nAs the trial progresses, both sides will present their evidence and arguments, with the prosecution's deep and diverse team facing off against the defense's solo act. The outcome of this landmark case will have far-reaching implications for police reform, racial justice, and the legal system as a whole."}

The airport, which was closed following the chaos that ensued after the Taliban's arrival in the capital city, is now nearly fully operational after repairs, Qatari and Taliban officials announced.\n\nU.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation Zalmay Khalilzad played a pivotal role in pressuring the Taliban to allow the departures. According to Khalilzad, \"The Taliban have shown flexibility and professionalism in facilitating the departure of those who wish to leave, including U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents.\"\n\nNational Security Council spokesperson Emily Horne confirmed that the U.S. had facilitated the safe departure of its citizens and lawful permanent residents.

U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin urged the Taliban to facilitate the departures, stating, \"We call on the Taliban to allow these flights to depart as soon as possible, and to ensure the safety and security of those seeking to leave.\"\n\nRecent Taliban actions have raised concerns among the international community. The Taliban announced an interim government, but the appointment of their new interim interior minister, Sirajuddin Haqqani, has been met with resistance as he is on the U.S.'s blacklist. Additionally, the Taliban have cracked down on protests and have shown little regard for the rights of journalists.\n\nInternational reactions to the Taliban's takeover and subsequent actions vary. European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell called on the Taliban to form an inclusive government and respect human rights, while the United Nations Security Council is considering imposing new sanctions on the Taliban.\n\nFormer Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, who fled the country amidst the chaos, has denied allegations that he fled with millions in cash. Ghani, who is currently in the United Arab Emirates, has called for a U.N. investigation into the claims.\n\nZalmay Khalilzad: \"The Taliban have shown flexibility and professionalism in facilitating the departure of those who wish to leave, including U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents.\"\n\nEmily Horne: \"The U.S. is committed to ensuring the safe and orderly departure of its citizens and lawful permanent residents, as well as those of our allies and partners.\"\n\nMutlaq al-Qahtani: \"We welcome the Taliban's cooperation in facilitating these departures, and we look forward to continuing our work with them to ensure the smooth operation of Kabul airport for all legitimate travelers.\"\n\nQari Yousef Ahmadi: \"We understand the concerns of the international community, and we are committed to working with them to ensure the safe and orderly departure of foreign nationals and Afghans with valid travel documents.\"\n\nLloyd Austin: \"We call on the Taliban to allow these flights to depart as soon as possible, and to ensure the safety and security of those seeking to leave.\"\n\nJosep Borrell: \"We call on the Taliban to form an inclusive government that reflects the diversity of the Afghan population and respects the human rights of all Afghans.\""}

The senator said his daughters asked to go on the trip, and he believed they would be safer there than in Texas amid the power outages and water shortages caused by the storm.\n\n\"I was trying to be a dad,\" Cruz told reporters upon his return to Texas on Monday. \"I think it was obviously a mistake. And in hindsight, I wouldn't have done it.\"\n\nAllen West, chair of the Texas Republican Party, did not defend Cruz's actions. \"We're focused on the needs of Texans,\" West told the AP. \"The focus right now needs to be on the response and the recovery efforts.\"\n\nOver 7 million Texans were advised to boil water before drinking due to infrastructure damage from the storm. The crisis prompted widespread criticism of the state government's response and Cruz's absence.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Jen Psaki weighed in on the controversy during a briefing Monday. \"The American people have been through a lot over the past year, and they expect their elected officials to be there for them, not abandoning them during crises,\" Psaki said.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, also commented on Cruz's actions on Twitter, writing, \"Texans can't even drink their water. Their leaders are abandoning them. But hey, at least Ted Cruz and his family will be getting some sun.\"\n\nCruz returned to Texas early Sunday, citing the need to focus on the state's crisis. However, his office contacted the Houston Police Department about his return, according to Jodi Silva, a department spokesperson. It's unclear if this was a typical procedure for the senator.\n\n\"We don't have any specific information regarding Senator Cruz's return,\" Silva told the AP. \"We typically don't provide details on security matters or individuals' travel plans.\"\n\nThe controversy may affect Cruz's political future, including his potential 2024 presidential run. Some Republicans expressed disappointment with Cruz's decision to leave the state during the crisis.\n\n\"Senator Cruz should have stayed in Texas to help lead the response efforts,\" Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller said in a statement. \"I understand wanting to be a good dad, but being a good dad also means being a good senator.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Texas residents continued to suffer from the storm's aftermath, with power outages and water shortages persisting in some areas. Gov. Greg Abbott declared a state of disaster in 112 counties, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) sent additional resources to the state.\n\nDespite the challenges, some Texans remained hopeful that their leaders would address their needs. \"We just need help,\" said Maria Gonzalez, a Houston resident who spent hours waiting in line for bottled water. \"We need our leaders to step up and do what's right.\"\n\nCruz, for his part, vowed to work toward a solution. \"I'm going to roll up my sleeves, and I'm going to help Texans rebuild,\" he told reporters Monday. \"That's what I've always done, and that's what I'll continue to do.\""}

Daniel Cohan, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at Rice University, commented on the findings:\n\n\"When the power grid failed, it was not just a single cause. It was a combination of factors – freezing temperatures, lack of winterization, and natural gas supply issues,\" Cohan said.\n\nThe report also revealed that most natural gas production and processing facilities were not protected from load shedding, leading to a decline in supply. Ramanan Krishnamoorti, the chief energy officer at the University of Houston, emphasized the importance of winterizing equipment:\n\n\"The key takeaway from the report is the need for winterization. We need to ensure that our power generators, as well as our natural gas infrastructure, are adequately prepared for extreme weather events,\" Krishnamoorti said.\n\nFERC has offered 28 recommendations, focusing on winterizing equipment and conducting annual winterization training. However, a similar report was issued in 2011, but most recommendations were not implemented by power providers.\n\n\"It's crucial that these recommendations are taken seriously and acted upon to prevent another catastrophic event like this from happening again,\" Cohan added.\n\nThe Texas power grid's improvement requires making economic incentives for energy producers to enhance reliability. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) is working with the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to implement legislated mandates and improve grid reliability, in response to the report's findings.\n\nERCOT President and CEO Bill Magness stated, \"We're working on a comprehensive set of improvements to make sure we're better prepared for future extreme weather events.\"\n\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's full report and recommendations are available on their website. The report underscores the importance of preparing for extreme weather events, particularly in Texas, where the power grid is under constant pressure due to the state's rapid population growth and increasing energy demand."}

The urgency of these efforts was underscored by the May 2021 cyberattack on Colonial Pipeline, which temporarily disrupted fuel supplies along the East Coast.\n\nKimberly Denbow, Managing Director of Security and Operations at the American Gas Association, emphasized, \"The cybersecurity threat landscape is constantly evolving, and it's essential that we remain vigilant to protect our critical energy infrastructure.\"\n\nImproving cybersecurity for pipeline infrastructure, however, faces several challenges. The expanding attack surface, complex legacy networks, and the need for better visibility into OT systems pose significant hurdles. \"Our systems were not designed with cybersecurity in mind,\" admitted Melissa Ruiz, Spokesperson for Kinder Morgan. \"It's a challenge to retrofit these older systems with the necessary security features.\"\n\nThe aftermath of the Colonial Pipeline attack served as a wake-up call for the need to bolster pipeline cybersecurity. \"The incident demonstrated the potential consequences of a successful cyberattack on pipeline operations,\" Denbow noted. \"It's crucial that we implement effective measures to mitigate these risks.\"\n\nExperts and regulators alike are advocating for minimum cybersecurity standards for pipeline operators. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has been at the forefront of these efforts, with FERC Chairman Richard Glick emphasizing the need for mandatory cybersecurity requirements. \"Ensuring the security of our nation's critical energy infrastructure is a shared responsibility,\" he stated.\n\nHowever, the lack of current standards raises concerns about potential ineffective or burdensome regulations stemming from a hurried policy response. \"It's important that any new regulations are practical and effective,\" Denbow emphasized. \"We don't want to create unnecessary burdens for our members.\"\n\nPipeline operators are willing to comply with guidelines such as those from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), but they seek more government protection against state-sponsored cyberattacks. \"Private sector efforts alone are not enough to protect against sophisticated, state-sponsored attacks,\" Ruiz pointed out.\n\nIn response to these concerns, the Biden administration has issued directives imposing minimum cybersecurity requirements on pipeline operators. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is also considering long-term rulemaking for pipeline cybersecurity, with more stakeholder involvement to ensure a balanced approach.\n\nDespite these efforts, a significant portion of pipeline operators have been found to have inadequate cybersecurity practices, with weaknesses such as insecure passwords and poor network segmentation. \"These vulnerabilities can be exploited by cybercriminals to cause significant disruptions,\" Denbow warned.\n\nLegacy OT systems and increasing network connectivity have heightened vulnerabilities within pipeline systems. \"It's essential that we invest in modernizing our infrastructure and implementing robust cybersecurity measures,\" Ruiz concluded. \"The safety and security of our communities depend on it.\"\n\nOverall, the collaboration between government and industry to fortify U.S. oil and natural gas pipelines against cyberattacks is a critical step towards safeguarding the nation's energy infrastructure. The challenges posed by expanding vulnerabilities, complex legacy networks, and the need for better visibility into OT systems necessitate a balanced and practical approach to cybersecurity standards and regulations."}

The statement, signed by all eight members, denounced the violent assault on the U.S. Congress, the Capitol building, and the Constitutional process.\n\nThe Joint Chiefs described the events of that day as an affront to the democratic process and the rule of law, emphasizing that the rights of freedom of speech and assembly do not justify violence, sedition, or insurrection.\n\nThe military leaders warned service members against impeding the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden on January 20, 2021. They reminded them that any act to disrupt the Constitutional process is against the law.\n\nChair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Army Gen. Mark Milley, and the other chiefs felt compelled to address the issue partly because some veterans and possibly active-duty troops were allegedly involved in the Capitol attack.\n\nThe statement reaffirmed the military's commitment to maintaining the apolitical nature of the armed services. Historically, the Joint Chiefs tend to speak out on highly egregious matters that threaten the integrity of the military or the nation.\n\nThe Joint Chiefs' condemnation of the Capitol riot represents a significant departure from the military's historically restrained stance on political matters.

However, the severity of the Capitol riot, which resulted in the deaths of five individuals and injured dozens more, compelled the Joint Chiefs to issue this extraordinary statement.\n\nThe statement comes as President Donald Trump continues to spread false claims about the November 2020 election and its outcome. Some of his supporters have used these claims as justification for their involvement in the Capitol riot.\n\nThe Joint Chiefs' stance against the Capitol insurrection is a clear message to military personnel that they must uphold their oath to support and defend the Constitution, even in the face of political turmoil.\n\nThe statement also serves as a reminder to the American public that the military's role is to ensure the security and stability of the nation, regardless of political developments.\n\nThe Joint Chiefs' unprecedented statement sends a strong message to military personnel and the American public that the events of January 6, 2021, are not in line with the values and principles that the United States Armed Forces uphold. It also underscores the importance of maintaining the apolitical nature of the military in times of political uncertainty."}

The sighting suggests that Baldwin and his family are staying in the New England area as they navigate the fallout from the tragic shooting incident on the set of Baldwin's film, 'Rust.'\n\nThe sighting comes on the heels of the fatal shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on October 21, 2021, during the filming of 'Rust' in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The tragic incident also injured director Joel Souza.\n\nBaldwin, a versatile actor with a career spanning over three decades, has been no stranger to controversy. His quick temper and outspoken nature have often landed him in the headlines. However, the latest incident on the set of 'Rust' has left him devastated, leading him to express his condolences to Hutchins' family and fully cooperate with police investigations.\n\nRecent articles on social media have suggested that Baldwin was told the gun he used on the set of 'Rust' was safe before it accidentally fired, resulting in Hutchins' death and injuring Souza. Baldwin has shared these articles on his Twitter account, adding fuel to the ongoing investigation.\n\nNo charges have been filed against Baldwin as Santa Fe police continue to investigate the incident. The New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator concluded that Hutchins died as a result of a gunshot wound to the chest.\n\nBaldwin's presence in Vermont indicates a desire to be away from the spotlight and potentially avoid harassment. However, even in a low-profile location, the paparazzi were able to find and photograph the actor, further adding to the media frenzy surrounding the incident.\n\nThe tragedy on the 'Rust' set has sparked discussions around safety protocols on film sets and Baldwin's involvement. Several industry professionals have come forward to share their experiences with gun safety on set and emphasize the importance of adhering to established guidelines.\n\nAccording to the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE), the union that represents film crew members, the production of 'Rust' had a safety coordinator on set. However, the circumstances surrounding the incident have raised questions about the adequacy of the safety measures in place.\n\nBaldwin's representatives issued a statement following the incident, stating, \"There were no words or actions that I could have prevented that would have stopped Joel Souza from being injured or Halyna Hutchins from being killed by the misfired prop gun.\"\n\nDespite the controversy, Baldwin's career has not been entirely derailed. In 2022, he is set to appear in the Apple TV+ series 'The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,' alongside Samuel L. Jackson and Dominique Fishback.\n\nBaldwin's role as Jack Donaghy on SNL earned him three Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series. The character's sharp wit and political satire resonated with audiences for over seven seasons.\n\nThe 'Rust' incident is not Baldwin's first brush with tragedy on set. In 2019, Baldwin was involved in an altercation with a production staff member on the set of 'Mother's Day.' The incident led to Baldwin being charged with misdemeanor harassment.\n\nAs the investigations into the 'Rust' set tragedy continue, it remains to be seen what the future holds for Baldwin's career. Regardless, the actor's past successes and the circumstances surrounding the incident have left an indelible mark on the entertainment industry."}

This costly error, caused by a poorly designed user interface in Citibank's Flexcube software, has sent shockwaves through the financial industry.\n\nIn a recent ruling, a New York judge sided with the creditors, citing 'human error' and pointing to the software's instruction manual and Citibank's 'six eyes process.' The six eyes process is a double-check system, where transactions are reviewed by multiple people to prevent errors, but it apparently failed to catch this significant blunder.\n\nThe incident underscores a design defect in the Flexcube software, which led to the massive financial loss. This unfortunate incident is an example of the broader issue of design debt, where poor user experience (UX) design leads to costly errors over time.\n\nDesign debt is a term used to describe the long-term consequences of neglecting UX design, leading to inefficiencies, user frustration, and ultimately, costly mistakes. Improving employee UX design is identified as a significant opportunity for businesses to reduce errors and enhance productivity.\n\nAccording to recent studies, about half of design teams currently work on employee-facing software, a number that is expected to grow as businesses increasingly recognize the importance of UX in the workplace.\n\nCitigroup is known for its investment in consumer-facing UX but may have neglected employee-facing software like Flexcube. This oversight could potentially cost the company dearly in the long run, as inefficient software can lead to employee frustration, slower processing times, and increased error rates.\n\nThe error with Flexcube could prompt other software vendors to prioritize UX improvements to avoid similar consequences. As the financial industry becomes increasingly digitized, ensuring that employees have an intuitive and user-friendly experience is crucial.\n\nBad UX has led to other major mistakes in the past. For instance, the USS John McCain accident, the Hawaii missile test warning, and the Three Mile Island meltdown are all examples of how poor design can have catastrophic consequences.\n\nImproving UX is crucial for better business results. Higher employee satisfaction, quicker training, increased market share, and the avoidance of costly mistakes are just a few of the benefits that come with investing in UX design.\n\nAs we move forward, it is essential for businesses to recognize the importance of UX design, not just for consumer-facing applications but also for employee-facing software. By prioritizing UX improvements, companies can reduce errors, enhance productivity, and create a more efficient and effective work environment."}

Brady admitted, \"I didn't really consider what could happen if I dropped it.\"\n\nJames Corden, amused by the story, asked, \"And what if you had dropped it?\" Brady joked, \"It would have been a disaster. I mean, it's a pretty sharp trophy. It could have sunk to the bottom.\"\n\nFortunately, the trophy was successfully caught by tight end Cam Brate, averting the catastrophe. Brady also shared that his 8-year-old daughter, Vivi, was the only one who voiced concern. \"She was the only one who was like, 'Dad, don't throw it!'\" Brady recalled with a laugh.\n\nThe incident served as a reminder for Brady of the meaningfulness of material items and their replaceability. \"You know, it's just a trophy. It's something that's meaningful, but it's replaceable,\" Brady reflected.\n\nAs the conversation turned to his impressive career, Brady's wife, Gisele, made headlines when she hinted at retirement during the parade. \"What more do you have to prove?\" she reportedly asked Brady. With a career that includes more Super Bowl wins than any other player in NFL history and a reputation as the greatest quarterback to ever play, Brady has much to consider.\n\nDespite the hints at retirement, Brady expressed his reluctance to stop playing. \"It's like running on a treadmill,\" he said. \"You don't want to get off. You just want to keep going.\"\n\nThroughout his career, Brady has proven his resilience and determination on the field. His impulsive Lombardi Trophy toss and reflections on his career serve as a testament to his unwavering passion for the game."}

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered an additional 1,000 US troops into Afghanistan, bringing the total to 6,000, to manage the evacuation.\n\nAustin said in a statement: \"I have authorized the Department of Defense to send approximately 1,000 additional troops to Afghanistan to support the safe and orderly drawdown of civilian personnel from the US Embassy in Kabul and other consular facilities.\"\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken described the evacuation as \"deliberate, orderly,\" and added: \"This is a complex operation, and it will take time.

A closer look at the past of \"Rust\" assistant director, Dave Halls, reveals a pattern of disregard for safety measures, leading to multiple injuries and even a fatality on the set of the 2019 film \"Freedom's Path.\"\n\nQuinton Rodriguez, a first assistant camera operator on \"Freedom's Path,\" shared his firsthand account of Halls' neglect of safety protocols.\n\n\"Dave Halls had a history of cutting corners when it came to safety,\" Rodriguez recalled. \"On 'Freedom's Path,' he didn't use a recommended crash pad for Carol Sutton during a scene, and she ended up getting injured.\"\n\nActress Carol Sutton, who passed away at age 76 in 2021, was injured after falling over during a scene due to inadequate safety measures.

(AP) – Motorists in over a dozen U.S. states faced gas station shortages following a cyberattack on Colonial Pipeline, which provides approximately 45% of the East Coast's gasoline. The pipeline, which was shut down on May 7, has restarted operations but is expected to take \"several days\" for fuel deliveries to normalize.\n\nAround 70% of gas stations in North Carolina and about half in Virginia, South Carolina, and Georgia were without fuel as of May 10. According to Stephen Brich, Highways Commissioner of Virginia, conservation strategies have been announced due to the pipeline shutdown's effects. Brich stated, \"We're asking Virginians to conserve gasoline and other petroleum products whenever possible.\"\n\nU.S. officials do not believe the Russian government was behind the attack but suspect the criminals are based in Russia. The cyberattack involved ransomware from a group known as DarkSide. Colonial Pipeline paid the ransom to restore operations, according to multiple reports.\n\nDr. Chris Holstege, Medical Director at the Blue Ridge Poison Center at UVA Health in Charlottesville, Virginia, emphasized the importance of avoiding panic-buying. Holstege said, \"We're urging people not to hoard gasoline, as this can exacerbate the situation and potentially lead to safety issues.\"\n\nGovernor Roy Cooper of North Carolina declared a state of emergency on May 10 and urged residents to avoid panic-buying. Cooper stated, \"North Carolina is working closely with Colonial Pipeline and the federal government to ensure a swift resolution to this issue.\"\n\nSydney Marshall, General Manager of South Georgia Motorsports Park and Orlando Speed World Dragway in Savannah, Georgia, was forced to postpone events due to the gas shortage. Marshall shared, \"It's disappointing to have to postpone our events, but the safety and well-being of our fans and staff is our top priority.\"\n\nThe East Coast, which relies on the pipeline for 45% of its gasoline, experienced delays rather than shortages. However, officials expect gas station supplies to recover in a couple of weeks, assuming no further panic-buying.\n\nVirginia and North Carolina have declared states of emergency, while other governors have urged against hoarding. In Georgia, Governor Brian Kemp stated, \"Georgians should continue to buy gas as they normally would, but only what they need for the week.\"\n\nThe gas shortage has affected various aspects of daily life, including emergency services and entertainment venues. Emergency responders in some areas have reported delays due to a decrease in available fuel, while entertainment venues have had to postpone events.\n\nAccording to the American Automobile Association (AAA), the average price of gasoline in the U.S. increased by approximately 10 cents per gallon since the pipeline shutdown. The national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline was $2.97 as of May 10, according to AAA.\n\nAAA Spokesperson Montrae Waiters urged motorists to avoid panic-buying and only purchase the fuel they need for the week. Waiters stated, \"The situation should improve in the coming days, so there's no need to stockpile gasoline.\"\n\nAs the East Coast works to recover from the gas shortage, officials and industry experts emphasize the importance of remaining calm and avoiding panic-buying. The situation is expected to improve in the coming weeks as fuel deliveries normalize."}

The inauguration took place under heavy security, with law enforcement agencies on high alert for potential threats from far-right extremist groups and militias.\n\nGen. Daniel Hokanson, the chief of the National Guard Bureau, said in a statement, \"The National Guard is proud to support and protect the constitutional process and the right of the American people to peacefully assembly and express their views.\" He added, \"Our troops are postured and prepared to respond to any situation that may arise.\"\n\nSecurity concerns were heightened following the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, which left five people dead and over 100 officers injured. Law enforcement agencies monitored social media platforms for any signs of planned protests or potential threats.\n\nDespite the heavy security presence and the closure of the National Mall, there were only a few scattered arrests, and no major protests took place. Over 25,000 troops and police were deployed in and around Washington, D.C., to maintain order.\n\nFederal agents were also wary of online chatter and possible infiltration attempts from extremist groups. The FBI vetted all 25,000 National Guard members in an unprecedented security effort, according to a law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.\n\nThe National Mall, which has traditionally been the site of large inaugural crowds, was closed to the public, and extensive checkpoints were set up around the city.\n\nQAnon followers, known for their conspiracy theories, expressed disappointment online as their predictions of mass arrests of political elites and other dramatic events did not materialize.\n\nTwelve National Guard members were removed from their duties due to extremist statements or ties to right-wing militias, according to military officials.\n\nGen. Hokanson said, \"We will not tolerate any acts of violence, destruction or disrespect to the American people, their communities, or their institutions.\" He added, \"Those who violate the law will be held accountable.\"\n\nBiden's inauguration marked a return to normalcy after a tumultuous few weeks that saw the violent attack on the Capitol and chaos in the final days of the Trump administration. But security in Washington, D.C., is expected to remain heightened for several days post-inauguration, as law enforcement agencies continue to monitor for any potential threats.\n\nGen. Hokanson said, \"The National Guard will continue to work closely with our federal, state and local partners to ensure the safety and security of the American people and their institutions.\"\n\nAs Biden took the oath of office, surrounded by a small crowd of family members and elected officials, the heavy security presence was a stark reminder of the challenges facing the new administration. But for the moment, the streets of Washington, D.C., were quiet, and the peaceful transfer of power continued.\n\nOne law enforcement official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, \"We were prepared for the worst, but it looks like it's going to be a relatively quiet day.\" He added, \"We'll continue to monitor the situation closely, but for now, we're just relieved that everything has gone smoothly.\"\n\nBiden's inauguration marks the beginning of a new chapter in American history, one that will be shaped by the challenges and opportunities of the coming days, weeks, and months. And while the heavy security presence was a reminder of the divisions that still exist in the country, it was also a testament to the resilience and determination of the American people to come together and move forward.\n\nGen. Hokanson said, \"The National Guard stands ready to support the American people and their institutions in times of need. We are committed to upholding the Constitution and protecting the rule of law.\" He added, \"We will continue to work closely with our partners to ensure the safety and security of all Americans.\""}

This incident, which occurred during a global economic recovery, is causing significant disruptions to global supply chains.\n\nChris Nicholson, CEO of Pathmind, a leading artificial intelligence company, shared his concerns, \"The Suez Canal blockage demonstrates how interconnected our global economy is, and the potential cascading effects of a single event.\"\n\nThe Suez Canal is crucial for the movement of goods between Europe and Asia, with more than 1.2 billion tons of cargo passing through it annually. The blockage, which has halted shipping traffic since March 23, highlights the fragility of global supply chains that are often built on complex and vulnerable structures.\n\nLukas Kinigadner, CEO and co-founder of Anyline, a technology company specializing in real-time data capture, emphasized, \"The Suez Canal crisis underscores the importance of companies having crisis management plans and being prepared for unforeseen disruptions.\"\n\nThe immediate consequences of the crisis are evident in various industries. Paul Hong, Distinguished University Professor of global supply chain management and Asian studies at The University of Toledo's College of Business and Innovation, explained, \"The oil market has seen jumps in prices due to the Suez Canal blockage. Additionally, the worsening shortages of computer chips, which were already a concern due to the pandemic, will likely be exacerbated.\"\n\nDavid Paulson, global vice president at Avnet, a leading global technology solutions provider, added, \"The disruption to the shipping industry could result in prolonged supply chain disruptions for various industries, particularly those reliant on goods from Asia.\"\n\nBrett Rose, national retail expert and founder and CEO of United National Consumer Suppliers, shared his perspective, \"The Suez Canal blockage is a reminder of the importance of supply chain visibility and agility to manage unexpected disruptions effectively.\"\n\nPierre Subeh, business expert and chief operating officer at marketing technology firm X Network, agreed, \"Decision-making agility and team involvement are crucial for navigating crises and finding solutions.\"\n\nThe current crisis may push companies towards considering onshoring and nearshoring to reduce supply chain complexity and risks. David Macknin, principal at risk assessment and management firm ChicagoRisk, commented, \"The Suez Canal crisis could prompt companies to rethink their supply chain strategies, including considering onshoring and nearshoring to mitigate risks.\"\n\nThe prolonged blockage of the Suez Canal could lead to shortages of finished goods in Europe, according to Paul Hong. He added, \"European companies reliant on goods from Asia might face challenges in meeting customer demands.\"\n\nThe shipping container shortage, which has been a concern for some time, is expected to worsen due to the Suez Canal crisis. David Paulson stated, \"The disrupted shipping traffic could contribute to a further worsening of the container shortage, potentially leading to increased costs and delays for businesses.\"\n\nChris Nicholson underlined the importance of trade credit insurance to protect against losses from supply chain disruptions. He explained, \"Trade credit insurance can help companies mitigate financial losses due to supply chain disruptions, such as those caused by the Suez Canal crisis.\"\n\nThe Suez Canal crisis serves as a reminder of the interconnectedness of the global economy. Lukas Kinigadner emphasized, \"Global events like the Suez Canal crisis can have far-reaching consequences, highlighting the need for companies to be prepared and agile in managing supply chain disruptions.\"\n\nThe crisis also illustrates the importance of contingency planning. Paul Hong advised, \"Businesses should have contingency plans in place to address potential supply chain disruptions, such as identifying alternative shipping routes or suppliers.\"\n\nThe Suez Canal crisis underscores the need for effective communication within supply chain networks. Brett Rose emphasized, \"Clear and timely communication is essential for managing supply chain disruptions effectively.\"\n\nCompanies can leverage technology to enhance their supply chain resilience. Pierre Subeh shared, \"Investing in technologies like real-time data analytics and automation can help companies better anticipate and respond to supply chain disruptions.\"\n\nThe Suez Canal crisis is a reminder that disruptions are an inherent part of global supply chains. David Macknin advised, \"Companies should be prepared for disruptions and have strategies in place to minimize their impact.\"\n\nThe Suez Canal crisis may lead to long-term changes in supply chain strategies. Paul Hong predicted, \"The crisis could accelerate trends like onshoring and nearshoring as companies seek to reduce their reliance on long and complex supply chains.\""}

Bush, passed away on Tuesday at the age of 88.\n\nRumsfeld served as Defense Secretary twice – first from 1975 to 1977 under Ford and later from 2001 to 2006 under Bush. His second term was marked by the controversial invasion of Iraq, which took place in March 2003.\n\nAt the time, Rumsfeld justified the invasion by claiming Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction (WMDs), which were later found to be non-existent. This revelation, along with other controversial decisions made during his tenure, led to significant international and domestic controversy.\n\nOne of the most infamous episodes during Rumsfeld's tenure was the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal, which came to light in 2004. The scandal involved the physical and sexual abuse of detainees held at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, leading to widespread international condemnation.\n\nRumsfeld also authorized harsh interrogation techniques for detainees at Guantánamo Bay and other facilities, drawing further criticism from human rights organizations and foreign governments.\n\nDespite his close alliance with Vice President Dick Cheney, Rumsfeld faced intense criticism for his handling of the Iraq war. President Bush replaced Rumsfeld in November 2006, citing diminishing support for the conflict.\n\nCritics argue that Rumsfeld's strategic errors in Iraq and Afghanistan contributed to the protracted nature of these conflicts. His management style and decisions were also blamed for the instability and violence in post-invasion Iraq.\n\nBeyond his government roles, Rumsfeld was a successful businessman, serving in various capacities including as a Navy pilot and U.S. NATO ambassador. He was born on June 9, 1932, in Evanston, Illinois, and graduated from Princeton University in 1954.\n\nRumsfeld began his political career in the 1960s, serving as a congressional liaison for the Department of Defense under President Lyndon B. Johnson. He went on to become a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Illinois from 1963 to 1969.\n\nRumsfeld's military career began in 1957 when he joined the U.S. Navy and became a fighter pilot. He flew 130 combat missions during the Vietnam War and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.\n\nIn the 1990s, Rumsfeld served as the U.S. Ambassador to NATO. He was also the chief executive officer of General Instrument Corporation from 1990 to 1993 and served on the board of directors of several other companies.\n\nDespite his controversial tenure as Defense Secretary, Rumsfeld will be remembered for his significant contributions to U.S. politics and military strategy. He is survived by his wife, Joyce, and their four children."}

However, the sheriff noted that the cause of the crash cannot be disclosed due to privacy issues requested by Woods' team.\n\n\"The investigation has concluded, as far as we're concerned,\" Villanueva told PEOPLE in an exclusive interview. \"But we can't release any information without consent from all parties involved.\"\n\nThe crash occurred on the border of Rolling Hills Estates and Rancho Palos Verdes in California. Woods' car hit a sign, sheared through a tree, and landed in the brush with major damage. Earlier reports stated that Woods had no recollection of driving or how the crash happened, based on a search warrant affidavit for his vehicle's black box.\n\nVillanueva's traffic collision investigator, Deputy Johann Schloegl, noted in the affidavit that a witness reported Woods was unconscious initially at the crash scene. However, Woods was conscious when deputies arrived, and he was transported to a local hospital for emergency surgery for significant injuries to his right lower extremity.\n\nVillanueva confirmed that officials have reached out to Woods and his personnel about waiving privacy to release the investigation information. \"We've contacted his team multiple times, but we haven't heard back,\" he said.\n\nA source close to Woods told PEOPLE that the golfer is focused on his recovery, feeling lucky to be alive, and appreciates the access to great medical care. \"He's doing well and is in good spirits,\" the source said. \"He's taking it one day at a time and is grateful for all the support he's received.\"\n\nWoods confirmed on social media that he is back home continuing his recovery and has reunited with his children. \"I want to thank everyone for the huge outpouring of support and love I've received over the past few weeks,\" Woods wrote on Twitter. \"It truly means so much to me and my family. I will be recovering at home and working on getting back to golf soon.\"\n\nVillanueva emphasized the importance of respecting Woods' privacy during this time. \"We understand that this is a difficult time for Tiger and his family, and we want to give them the space they need to focus on his recovery,\" Villanueva said. \"We will continue to respect their privacy and will not be releasing any further information at this time.\"\n\nThe cause of the crash may remain a mystery, but one thing is clear: Woods' focus is on healing and getting back to the sport he loves. \"He's a fighter, and he's going to come back stronger than ever,\" the source said. \"That's the Tiger we all know and love.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the golf community continues to rally around Woods. The Masters Tournament, which Woods has won five times, announced that it will dedicate a chair in Augusta National's Champions Locker Room in his honor. \"Tiger Woods is synonymous with golf, and he will always be a part of the Masters Tournament and the Augusta National Golf Club,\" tournament chairman Fred Ridley said in a statement. \"We look forward to his return to competitive golf.\"\n\nAs Woods continues his recovery, golf fans around the world will be hoping for a speedy and full recovery for their beloved champion. \"He's an inspiration to us all, and we can't wait to see him back on the course,\" the source said."}

This historically bipartisan move came as a surprise, especially considering the conservative leanings of some of these Senators' home states and their initial hesitance. Senators Richard Burr, Bill Cassidy, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Mitt Romney, Ben Sasse, and Patrick J. Toomey defied their party and voted to convict Trump on the charge of incitement of insurrection.\n\nSen. Bill Cassidy: \"The evidence presented and the constitutional questions raised during this trial have weighed heavily on me. I was not sent to Washington to hide behind procedural rules. I was sent by the people of Louisiana to represent their interests and values. I cannot in good conscience vote to acquit.\"\n\nSenator Bill Cassidy's vote was notably significant, given his conservative background and initial reluctance. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) also criticized Trump for his role in the Capitol attack but argued the constitutionality of convicting a former president negated the possibility of conviction. McConnell stated, \"The Constitution gives the Senate the power to convict and disqualify former officers. But that power does not mean it is always in the Senate's best interest to exercise it.\"\n\nSen. Mitt Romney: \"I believe impeachment is a matter of solemn import. Presidents don't get a free pass to incite violence against other Americans because they disagree with political outcomes. Impeachment isn't a remedy for policy differences.\"\n\nDemocrats decided against calling witnesses during the trial, a move criticized by some as backing down from fully presenting their case. Rep. Jamie Herrera Beutler (R-WA), who voted to impeach Trump in the House, testified before the Senate about a conversation between Trump and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) on January 6, in which Trump allegedly told McCarthy, \"Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are.\"\n\nLead House impeachment manager Jamie Raskin: \"We have demonstrated that the President's conduct was a direct and deadly threat to the constitutional order. We have met our burden of proof. The evidence is clear.\"\n\nThe Republicans' primary rationale for acquittal was the argued unconstitutionality of the trial proceedings. Many legal scholars, however, disagreed. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) argued, \"The Constitution does not grant Congress the power to impeach a former President and disqualify him from holding future office.\"\n\nRep. David N. Cicilline: \"A former President of the United States incited a violent insurrection against the United States government. That's not just a policy disagreement. That's not a matter of partisanship. That's a matter of fact.\"\n\nPost-vote comments from McConnell and others underscored Trump's responsibility for the Capitol attack, despite their votes against conviction. McConnell stated, \"There is no question—none—that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day.\"\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski: \"I believe President Trump's actions leading up to the Jan. 6th riot were a clear betrayal of his Oath of Office and duty to the nation. We know that the President's actions since the riot have again demonstrated an lack of commitment to preserving the institutions of our democracy.\"\n\nThe impeachment trial highlighted deep divisions within both parties and the broader political climate in the United States. There is anticipation for further investigations into the January 6 attack, akin to a 9/11 commission-style inquiry, and potential criminal liabilities for Trump and his associates. The acquittal signifies a missed opportunity for a more thorough examination and accountability for the events leading to and occurring on January 6."}

The pipeline, which carries nearly half of the East Coast's fuel supply, is once again delivering millions of gallons of gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel each hour.\n\nThe pipeline now services all its markets, including states from Texas to New Jersey. However, the resumption of operations has not immediately alleviated the widespread fuel shortages plaguing the affected regions.\n\nIn Washington D.C., up to 80% of gas stations remain without fuel, causing panic buying and long lines at the pumps. The shortages have forced some businesses to close and disrupted essential services.\n\nThe cyberattack, which forced the shutdown of about 5,500 miles of pipeline, had far-reaching consequences beyond the East Coast. The ensuing fuel shortages led to price spikes and long lines at gas stations as far west as Indiana and as north as Pennsylvania.\n\nColonial Pipeline carries a critical role in the U.S. energy infrastructure, transporting approximately 100 million gallons of fuel daily. The pipeline's disruption highlighted the vulnerabilities of the nation's energy infrastructure to cyber threats.\n\nOperations at Colonial Pipeline restarted on Wednesday evening, but not immediately at full capacity. The company is taking a phased approach to bringing its systems back online, prioritizing the delivery of fuel to the most critical markets and infrastructure.\n\nColonial Pipeline has reportedly paid nearly $5 million in ransom to the cybercriminals behind the attack, according to an anonymous U.S. official. The company has not confirmed the payment but has acknowledged that it was the victim of a ransomware attack.\n\nThe cyberattack was coordinated by a group known as DarkSide, which is believed to be a Russian-speaking criminal organization. DarkSide is known for deploying ransomware that encrypts victims' data and demands payment in exchange for the decryption key.\n\nThe Department of Energy led the federal response to the cyberattack, in coordination with the FBI, Homeland Security, and the Department of Defense. The federal agencies are working to assess the extent of the damage and provide assistance to affected states and industries.\n\nColonial Pipeline has committed to investing in resources to maintain safe and reliable operations in the wake of the cyberattack. The company is working to bolster its cybersecurity defenses and implement additional measures to protect against future attacks. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of securing critical infrastructure against cyber threats."}

The ACLU views this action as a prime example of Facebook's misuse of its content moderation power.\n\nWhile acknowledging the initial 24-hour suspension of Trump's account following the January 6 Capitol riots, the ACLU criticizes the indefinite ban due to the lack of precedence in Facebook's policies. The Oversight Board, an independent body established by Facebook to make binding decisions on content appeals, agreed with the initial suspension but denounced the indefinite ban.\n\nThe ACLU raises concerns over Facebook's significant control over public discourse and the inconsistencies in its content moderation policies. The organization emphasizes the importance of political speech, especially from political figures, and advocates for the least restrictive measures against such individuals.\n\nFacebook's Oversight Board has been criticized for its limited power and Facebook's failure to fully cooperate with it. The ACLU calls for a more transparent process in dealing with violations by political leaders and the preservation of rule-violating content for historical record.\n\nThe ambiguous and broad standards used by Facebook to moderate content are problematic, potentially affecting peaceful protests and other forms of expression. These standards can be overly restrictive, infringing on the rights of individuals to express their opinions and participate in public discourse.\n\nThe ACLU positions itself against outright bans for political figures, suggesting that individual offending statements be targeted instead. This approach allows for the protection of free speech while ensuring accountability for harmful content.\n\nClearer guidelines and processes from Facebook regarding the suspension or removal of political figures' accounts are essential. The ACLU encourages Facebook to consider context more effectively when assessing potential harm from posts, especially those from influential users. By doing so, Facebook can uphold its community standards while respecting the rights of its users."}

According to the latest data from the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), approximately half of parents of 12-17 year-olds report that their teenager has received a COVID-19 vaccine. This number stands in contrast to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data, which indicates that about 60% of teenagers aged 12-17 have been fully vaccinated.\n\nThe situation is similar for children between the ages of 5 and 11. KFF reports that about 16% of parents in this age group have vaccinated their child, with an additional 13% planning to do so 'right away.' These figures reflect a slower pace of vaccination compared to older age groups, leaving many pediatricians and public health officials concerned about the potential for future outbreaks.\n\nOne of the key reasons for the hesitancy among parents is the safety and potential side effects of the COVID-19 vaccines for their children. Three in ten parents of both teens and younger children express that they will 'definitely not' get their child vaccinated for COVID-19. These numbers are particularly high among certain demographic groups, including Hispanic, Black, and lower-income parents, who also express more concern over access barriers to vaccinating their children.\n\nDespite these concerns, pediatricians remain the most trusted source of vaccine information for parents. However, fewer than half of parents have discussed COVID-19 vaccinations with their child's healthcare provider. Schools, on the other hand, are increasingly becoming a source of information and encouragement for vaccinations. About half of parents report that their child's school provided information or encouraged COVID-19 vaccination. Parents who report their school encouraged COVID-19 vaccination are more likely to have vaccinated children.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant negative impact on parents and families, affecting mental health, financial stability, and children's education, especially among lower-income and minority groups. As the country continues to grapple with vaccine hesitancy and concerns, it is essential to address the root causes of these issues and work to build trust in the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines for children. Pediatricians, schools, community leaders, and public health officials can all play a role in fostering open dialogue and accurate information to help ensure that as many children as possible receive the protection offered by COVID-19 vaccines."}

Though disappointed by Harry's decision to quit royal duties, Philip reportedly understood his grandson's frustrations with the media, according to Gyles Brandreth, a biographer of the late prince.\n\n\"Prince Philip was saddened by Prince Harry's decision to step back from his royal duties, but he could sympathize with his grandson's struggles with the media,\" Brandreth shared. \"However, he strongly disapproved of Harry and Meghan's interview with Oprah Winfrey, which he saw as an unnecessary display of personal grievances.\"\n\nAlthough Philip was hospitalized when the interview aired, he was not upset about the timing. Instead, he expressed concern over the public airing of their personal issues, according to sources close to the royal family.\n\nDespite his disappointment, Philip remained proud of Harry's military service and his appointment as Captain General of the Royal Marines. \"The Duke respected Harry's commitment to duty and was particularly proud of his time in the military,\" Brandreth said.\n\nPrince Harry returned to the U.K. for Philip's funeral without Meghan, who remained in California due to her pregnancy. Their absence sparked speculation about the state of their relationship with the royal family.\n\nThe decision for Harry and Meghan to step back from senior royal duties was a mutual agreement between the Queen, Prince Charles, and Prince William, according to insiders. The couple expressed their desire for independent careers and philanthropy, which led to the separation.\n\nThe interview with Oprah Winfrey aired grievances against the royal family, including accusations of racism and neglect. The upcoming funeral service for Philip at St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, will undoubtedly spotlight Harry's interactions with the royal family, potentially shedding more light on the ongoing tension.\n\nObservers are curious about the potential for reconciliation between Harry and the royal family, especially with his brother, Prince William. According to Brandreth, \"Prince Philip believed in the importance of not focusing on oneself and advised his family against seeking popularity. This advice may serve as a guiding principle for the healing process within the royal family.\"\n\nBrandreth continued, \"Despite the challenges, Prince Philip's legacy will continue to shape the British monarchy and serve as a reminder of the importance of family, duty, and respect for tradition.\""}

According to de Oliveira, \"neglecting the HIV population during the COVID-19 pandemic could lead to devastating consequences, including increased mortality and the emergence of concerning coronavirus variants\" (de Oliveira, 2021).\n\nFailure to provide COVID-19 vaccines to nations with high HIV prevalence risks greater danger. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that 38 million people globally are living with HIV, and more than two-thirds of them reside in Sub-Saharan Africa (WHO, 2021). De Oliveira emphasizes that, \"if we don't address the COVID-19 vaccination rollout in these countries, we could not only be risking the lives of those living with HIV, but potentially contributing to the emergence of new coronavirus variants\" (de Oliveira, 2021).\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused drug shortages and treatment challenges for those with HIV. According to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the pandemic has disrupted the global HIV response, leading to an estimated 1.5 million fewer people receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in 2020 compared to 2019 (UNAIDS, 2021). De Oliveira states, \"the COVID-19 pandemic has put significant strain on healthcare systems, making it difficult to ensure a consistent supply of essential medications for people living with HIV\" (de Oliveira, 2021).\n\nPeople with HIV are 30-50% more likely to die from COVID-19, with a greater risk in those with advanced HIV (CDC, 2020). De Oliveira warns, \"given the increased risk of severe illness and death for people living with HIV, it is crucial that we prioritize their access to COVID-19 vaccines and treatments\" (de Oliveira, 2021).\n\nProlonged infections in immunocompromised individuals, like those with advanced HIV, can lead to concerning coronavirus variants. De Oliveira explains, \"the longer SARS-CoV-2 circulates in a population, the higher the likelihood of mutations occurring. This is particularly concerning in individuals with weakened immune systems due to HIV\" (de Oliveira, 2021).\n\nSub-Saharan Africa is significantly affected due to high HIV prevalence and insufficient ART coverage. UNAIDS reports that 25.7 million people in the region live with HIV, and only 63% of them have access to ART (UNAIDS, 2021). De Oliveira asserts, \"it's essential that we don't forget about the HIV crisis in Sub-Saharan Africa, especially as the region has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic\" (de Oliveira, 2021).\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic disruptions have strained healthcare, reduced HIV testing, and affected prevention programs. The WHO reports that HIV testing has decreased by 50% in some African countries during the pandemic (WHO, 2021). De Oliveira laments, \"the COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruptions to healthcare systems and prevention programs in Sub-Saharan Africa, putting the gains made in the fight against HIV at risk\" (de Oliveira, 2021).\n\nAfrica lags in COVID-19 vaccine access, with less than 7% fully vaccinated compared to the global 40%. According to the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, only 6.6% of the continent's population has been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 as of October 2021 (Africa CDC, 2021). De Oliveira urges, \"we need to redouble our efforts to ensure that vaccines reach those most in need, both in terms of HIV and COVID-19\" (de Oliveira, 2021).\n\nThe COVAX initiative, aimed at distributing two billion vaccine doses by the end of 2021, is falling short of its goal. As of October 2021, COVAX had distributed just over one billion doses (GAVI, 2021). De Oliveira calls for action, stating, \"it's crucial that we come together as a global community to address the interconnected crises of COVID-19 and HIV, particularly in regions like Sub-Saharan Africa\" (de Oliveira, 2021).\n\nQuote from Tulio de Oliveira: \"Neglecting the HIV population during the COVID-19 pandemic could lead to devastating consequences, including increased mortality and the emergence of new coronavirus variants.\"\n\n\"The longer SARS-CoV-2 circulates in a population, the higher the likelihood of mutations occurring.

Chansley's attorney, Albert Watkins, made the announcement on Thursday.\n\nAlbert Watkins, Chansley's lawyer: \"Mr. Chansley is prepared to testify truthfully about his actions on January 6, 2021, at the U.S. Capitol, including but not limited to, his presence at the Capitol, his interactions with law enforcement, and his conversations with others regarding the events of that day.\"\n\nChansley, who was dressed in face paint, no shirt, and a fur hat adorned with horns during the insurrection, has become a recognizable figure in the aftermath of the violent events that transpired on January 6, 2021. He is a self-proclaimed leader in the QAnon conspiracy theory movement.\n\nDespite his willingness to testify, Chansley, who faces multiple charges, including civil disorder and obstruction, feels betrayed by Trump after not receiving a pardon for his actions during the insurrection. In an interview with 60 Minutes, Chansley expressed his disappointment: \"I thought he'd come through for us.\"\n\nChansley and other rioters claim they were incited by Trump to participate in the riot. In his statement to the FBI, Chansley admitted his role in the events: \"I came to D.C. at the request of the 45th President of the United States.\" However, prosecutors argue that Chansley led a group into the Senate chamber and left a threatening note for Vice President Mike Pence, which read, \"It's Only A Matter Of Time, Justice Is Coming.\"\n\nWatkins maintains that Chansley did not intend to threaten anyone: \"Mr. Chansley's intent was not to threaten Vice President Pence, nor was it to incite or encourage violence. Instead, Mr. Chansley intended to engage peacefully with his fellow Americans and to express his grievances regarding the election results.\"\n\nChansley called the FBI to admit his involvement in the riot on January 16, 2021. During the call, Chansley referred to Pence as a \"child-trafficking traitor,\" reflecting the baseless conspiracy theories that have fueled the actions of some rioters.\n\nThe arraignment for Chansley and other rioters is scheduled for February 16, 2021, in Washington, D.C. If convicted, Chansley could face up to 20 years in prison.\n\nAs the impeachment trial proceeds, Chansley's testimony could potentially shed light on the motivations and actions of those who stormed the Capitol on January 6, 2021. However, it remains to be seen how much impact his testimony will have on the outcome of the trial."}

The decision comes in the wake of legal and regulatory scrutiny, including a $5 billion fine from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and a $650 million class-action lawsuit in Illinois.\n\nAbout one-third of Facebook users have facial recognition features enabled, which allows the platform to suggest tags for photos based on users' facial features.

It sets a powerful precedent for other tech companies to follow.\"\n\nDigital rights advocates, including Fight for the Future, have long argued that all facial recognition technology should be banned due to privacy concerns and inaccuracy issues, particularly for marginalized communities.\n\nFacebook's database of identified photos is one of the largest in the world. With the discontinuation of the facial recognition system, users will now be required to manually tag photos going forward.\n\nQuote from Caitlin Seeley George: \"While the discontinuation of Facebook's facial recognition feature is a positive step, it's important to remember that other companies and governments continue to use this invasive technology. We must remain vigilant and demand stronger privacy protections across the board.\"\n\nMeta, Facebook's parent company, is pivoting towards a new public image amidst these changes, focusing on its virtual reality and metaverse initiatives. The move away from facial recognition may be seen as part of this rebranding effort.\n\nSeveral U.S. cities and states, including San Francisco, Boston, and New York, have passed laws limiting the use of facial recognition software. Companies like IBM and Amazon have also distanced themselves from facial recognition technology in response to public pressure and regulatory scrutiny.\n\nCriticism of facial recognition technology extends beyond Facebook and reaches other tech companies and governments. In 2019, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) released a report detailing numerous cases of racial and gender bias in facial recognition systems.\n\nApple's Face ID includes safeguards to prevent misuse, such as requiring a user's attention and the use of a passcode after multiple failed attempts. However, users concerned about privacy can opt for a PIN instead.\n\nQuote from Caitlin Seeley George: \"Apple's approach to facial recognition is a step in the right direction, but it's not enough. We need stronger privacy protections and regulations to ensure that facial recognition technology is used ethically and responsibly.\"\n\nFacial recognition technology has been used in various applications, from security and law enforcement to marketing and social media. Critics argue that the technology can be used to invade privacy, facilitate discrimination, and infringe upon civil liberties.\n\nThe debate over facial recognition technology and its implications for privacy and civil liberties is far from over. As the technology continues to evolve, it's crucial that we engage in an ongoing dialogue about its ethical use and potential consequences.\n\nIn a world where technology is becoming increasingly integrated into our daily lives, it's essential that we prioritize privacy and autonomy. The discontinuation of Facebook's facial recognition system is a step in the right direction, but it's just the beginning of the conversation. We must remain vigilant and demand stronger privacy protections and regulations to ensure that technology is used ethically and responsibly."}

Michael Pearce, Senior U.S. Economist at Capital Economics, commented, \"Retail sales have bounced back sharply in March, driven by the continued rollout of the vaccine and the latest round of fiscal stimulus.\"\n\nThis increase followed a 2.7% decline in February and represented the best month for retail sales since May 2020. The spending boost was largely attributed to the third round of stimulus checks from the American Rescue Plan Act. First-time filings for unemployment insurance for the week ended April 10 fell to 576,000, the lowest since the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic. The unemployment rate has decreased from a pandemic peak of 14.7% to its current 6%.\n\nSpending was broad-based across sectors with significant gains in sporting goods, clothing, and the bar and restaurant industry. Pearce added, \"The reopening of the economy has led to a strong pickup in spending on services such as eating out and travel, while consumer durables have also benefited from the continued strength of the housing market.\"\n\nDespite the stimulus-fueled spending, a larger portion of the checks is being saved compared to the first round of stimulus. Inflationary pressures are becoming evident, with a notable year-over-year consumer price index rise of 2.6% in March. Pearce cautioned, \"However, the rapid rebound in demand could lead to upward pressure on prices, particularly in sectors where supply chains have been disrupted.\"\n\nConsumption growth is expected to continue rebounding rapidly in the second quarter. The labor market shows signs of improvement, with a significant addition of 916,000 nonfarm payrolls in March. Pearce concluded, \"The economic recovery is gaining momentum, but there are still risks on the horizon, including rising inflation and the possibility of slower progress in vaccine rollouts.\""}

The Ever Given, a 200,000-ton vessel, was refloated six days after becoming stuck on March 23, causing a major disruption in international shipping.\n\nThe incident held up an estimated $9 billion in global trade per day and left 422 vessels waiting to pass through the Suez Canal. Rabie hopes for a compensation agreement soon but did not specify who might be liable to pay.\n\nAly Awamy, a mechanic with the Mashhour Dredger, which played a crucial role in the rescue operation, described the challenges faced in freeing the ship. \"It was an extremely difficult operation,\" Awamy said. \"The ship was wedged tightly, and we had to work against the clock to prevent further damage.\"\n\nMohammed Sayed, head dredger of the Mashhour Dredger, added, \"We worked around the clock to remove the sand and mud that had accumulated around the ship's hull. It was a dangerous operation, and we had to be very careful not to cause any further damage.\"\n\nYoussef Naghi, another dredger involved in the operation, echoed their sentiments. \"We knew that every minute counted, and we couldn't afford any mistakes,\" he said. \"It was a team effort, and we all worked together to get the job done.\"\n\nAn investigation into the incident is underway, examining potential human and technical errors that may have contributed to the grounding of the Ever Given. Brian Schneider, senior director of the insurance division of Fitch Ratings, estimated that insurance industry losses from the incident would be in the low hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nThe complex ownership and management structure of the Ever Given adds to the challenge of determining responsibility. The vessel is operated by Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement and owned by Shoei Kisen. Spokespersons for both companies have confirmed that they are in discussions about compensation but have not provided specifics.\n\nBernhard Schulte Shipmanagement released a statement saying, \"We are committed to working with all parties involved to reach a fair and equitable solution. Our focus remains on ensuring the safe and efficient operation of the Ever Given and minimizing any disruption to global supply chains.\"\n\nShoei Kisen has also issued a statement, \"We deeply regret the incident and are cooperating fully with the authorities and all parties involved to resolve the situation as soon as possible. We will work diligently to minimize the impact on our customers and the global supply chain.\"\n\nThe Suez Canal is a crucial shipping route, linking Europe and Asia, and any disruption to its operations can have far-reaching consequences for the global economy. The SCA's call for compensation highlights the significant financial impact of the Ever Given incident and underscores the importance of maintaining the safe and efficient operation of the canal."}

The lawyers contended that Trump's speech was protected by the First Amendment, and the impeachment lacked due process and was unconstitutional since Trump is no longer in office.\n\nBruce Castor, one of Trump's lawyers, stated during the trial, \"President Trump's conduct on January 6 did not involve criminal acts, let alone high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\" Castor further emphasized, \"There is no factual or legal basis for impeaching a former President.\"\n\nDavid Schoen added, \"The First Amendment protects political hyperbole and the rhetorical give-and-take of the political marketplace.

Schumer stated, \"The trial will provide the opportunity for the full and fair consideration of the factual, legal, and constitutional issues at stake.\"\n\nDespite the ongoing trial, Trump has continued to make statements regarding the impeachment process. In a statement on Tuesday, he claimed, \"It is a continuation of the greatest Witch Hunt in American History.\"\n\nTrump's lawyers condemned the House Democrats' impeachment efforts as political theater and dangerous to democracy. Castor stated, \"This Article of Impeachment is an affront to the Constitution, an affront to the American people, and an affront to the legislative process.\"\n\nSchoen added, \"It is an affront to the traditions of the United States Senate, and an affront to the very institution of impeachment itself.\"\n\nAs the trial progresses, it remains to be seen how the Senate will rule on the constitutionality of impeaching a former president and whether witnesses will be called to testify.
