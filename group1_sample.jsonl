Manning, a two-time Super Bowl winner and brother of Peyton Manning, retired from football last year and has since kept a low profile compared to his sibling. However, that doesn't mean he isn't passionate about the game. When asked about the current NFL playoffs, Manning is excited about the Drew Brees vs. Tom Brady matchup in the NFC Divisional round. He also mentions his old teammate Victor Cruz and their involvement with Stella Stadium Bites, a Super Bowl food ideas initiative. As for his post-football plans, Manning is keen to stay involved in the sport and is open to coaching opportunities in the future."}
