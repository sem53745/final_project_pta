This Sunday, January 17, the New Orleans Saints take on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the NFC's Divisional round. But it's not about these NFL franchises so much as who is leading them now and what they have accomplished. In short, the buzz is about two legendary quarterbacks squaring off.\n\nThe Saints' Drew Brees, the all-time leader in passing yards (80,358) and completions (7,142), will take on longtime New England Patriots QB and new Bucs leader, Tom Brady, who sits second in both all-time passing yards and completions (with 79,204 and 6,778).\n\nLike most of us, longtime News York Giants quarterback Eli Manning says he'll be tuned in for the big face-off too. The four-time NFL Pro Bowler, who spent his entire career with the Giants, won two Super Bowls with them—Super Bowls XLII and XLVI, both against Tom Brady and the Patriots.\n\nSince retiring after the 2019 season, Manning has kept a mostly quiet profile, especially if you compare his activity to that of his very outgoing brother, former Denver Broncos quarterback and fellow two-time Super Bowl champ Peyton Manning. Over the years, Eli Manning has been involved in his share of charity work and has sat on the previous administration's President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. He's also been a brand ambassador for such well-known names as Citizen Watch Co., Toyota and NFLShop.com.\n\nRelated Article: Jerome Bettis says NFL still a running back's game\n\nAnd with the annual march to the NFL's biggest game, you'll likely see Manning take to his old stomping ground at MetLife Stadium, along with former Giants teammate Victor Cruz, to talk Super Bowl game day food ideas for Stella Stadium Bites, a partnership involving beer mega brand Stella Artois and food kit maker Blue Apron APRN .\n\nEarlier today, I spoke with the 15-year NFL veteran about his thoughts on the NFC Playoffs, his past rivalry with Tom Brady and the Patriots, and what it's like to be part of the Manning Family football dynasty.\n\nAndy Frye: This weekend the buzz is on the Saints-Bucs game, with Tom Brady versus Drew Brees. You've played against both these guys, so what's your take?\n\nEli Manning: It's a great matchup and they've already faced each other twice this season, but both quarterbacks are playing great football right now. Even with his injury, Drew has come back and played great last week. And Tom is doing the same. They both have all their weapons and have come back healthy. Both defenses are playing well, and so it will be interesting how it plays out.\n\nIt's amazing what both those guys are doing at 40-plus years old, still playing at such a high level.\n\nRelated Article: Why NY Giants' Zak DeOssie Left Football For Wall Street\n\nAF: You beat Brady twice in the Super Bowl. What was your mindset like in those games, and how did you lead your team to beat the Patriots?\n\nManning: Well, it's really easy to beat them. You just have to have Michael Strahan, Justin Tuck, Osi Umenyiora and Jason Pierre-Paul on the defensive line—guys like that—making a bunch of sacks, and it shouldn't be a problem at all."}

Andrew Cuomo's feet to the fire for his handling of the coronavirus in the early months of the pandemic, when the Democratic governor regularly appeared on his brother's CNN program for friendly interviews.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James said that the state Department of Health underreported COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes by as much as 50%, according to a report released Thursday.\n\nCuomo famously directed nursing homes in the Empire State to accept patients who had or were suspected of having COVID-19. The decision created an onslaught of COVID-19 cases that infected thousands of elderly patients and resulted in hundreds of deaths among the state's most vulnerable population. He eventually reversed the decision – but thousands had died from COVID-19 in New York nursing homes before Cuomo reversed course.\n\nNY UNDERCOUNTED NURSING HOME CORONAVIRUS DEATHS BY AS MUCH AS 50%, STATE AG SAYS\n\nAround the same time, Cuomo made regular appearances on \"Cuomo Prime Time,\" a CNN program hosted by his younger brother, Chris. The siblings conducted a series of playful on-air conversations masquerading as interviews as Americans wanted answers from the elder Cuomo amid the nursing home scandal.\n\nInstead, the CNN host joked around with his brother about things such as who is their mother's favorite child. Days after Cuomo signed an executive order on May 11 stopping hospitals from sending infected patients back to nursing homes and ramping up testing for staff, he appeared on his brother's show for a 25-minute sit-down that made no mention of the nursing home death toll.\n\nThere was only one mention of nursing homes during the entire interview, which was when Andrew Cuomo was boasting about the state's increased coronavirus testing capabilities and listed nursing homes and prisons among the sites that they had been administered.\n\nCNN'S CHRIS CUOMO DOES PROP COMEDY WITH NY GOV. ANDREW CUOMO, FAILS TO ASK ABOUT NURSING-HOME CONTROVERSY\n\nDuring one infamous segment, the Cuomo brothers turned to physical comedy after the CNN anchor played a clip of the governor taking a coronavirus test where a nurse placed a cotton swab up his nostril.\n\n\"Is it true that this was the swab that the nurse was actually using on you?\" the primetime host asked his brother while holding a cartoonishly oversized cotton swab.\n\nHe then quickly followed by presenting him an even larger cotton swab, asking the governor if that was the one the nurse used on him.\n\nCornell Law School professor and media critic William A. Jacobson blasted CNN following the prop comedy routine by the Cuomo siblings.\n\nCNN'S CHRIS CUOMO FINALLY ASKS BROTHER SOFTBALL QUESTION ON NY NURSING HOME CONTROVERSY\n\n\"CNN's coverage of Andrew Cuomo has been consistent with much of the media, focus on the glowing verbiage and ignore the catastrophic mishandling of nursing homes that led to thousands of deaths,\" Jacobson told Fox News at the time.\n\n\"This problem is compounded by a serious conflict of interest arising from the relationship between Chris Cuomo, one of CNN's highest-profile news personalities, and his brother the Governor,\" Jacobson added. \"Chris Cuomo should not be allowed to cover or comment on air about his brother, and CNN should appoint someone to monitor and review coverage of Andrew Cuomo to prevent this conflict of interest from bleeding over to other news coverage.\"\n\nDespite widespread criticism, CNN continued to allow the Cuomo brothers to chat on air. In June, CNN's Cuomo finally mentioned the nursing home controversy to his brother after ignoring it during at least 10 on-air interviews since the scandal began.\n\n\"Nursing homes. People died there, they didn't have to, it was mismanaged and the operators have been given immunity. What do you have to say about that?\" the CNN anchor asked after months of ignoring the topic.\n\n\"Several statements that are not correct, but that's OK. It's your show, you say whatever you want to say,\" Gov. Cuomo jokingly reacted.\n\nGOV. ANDREW CUOMO GETS A PASS FROM CNN ON NURSING HOME POLICY CONTROVERSY\n\nThe governor then called the nursing home deaths \"the most tragic situation\" and pointed to how there were nursing home deaths \"all across the country\" and said \"we have to figure out how to do it better the next time\" before the next virus wave occurs."}

The President committed to the American people that he would confront this unprecedented challenge with the full strength and capabilities of the federal government. Each day since taking office, the President has done just that – mobilizing a whole-of-government, wartime effort to defeat COVID-19. And, he has brought all Americans, including public and private sector leaders, together and asked them to do their part.\n\nThe results are clear: America is starting to look like America again, and entering a summer of joy and freedom.\n\n300 Million Shots in 150 Days\n\nWhen President Biden took office, about 5% of adult Americans had gotten vaccinated. At the pace the U.S. was vaccinating in January, it would have taken 336 days to get to 300 million shots in arms. And, inadequate vaccine supply, vaccinators, and places to get vaccinated severely limited Americans' access to vaccines.\n\nThanks to the Biden Administration's whole-of-government effort to stand up a first-of-its-kind, best-in-class nationwide vaccination program, today, more than 175 million Americans have gotten at least one COVID-19 vaccine shot.\n\n65% of adult Americans have at least one shot, and 55% of adults are fully vaccinated.\n\n87% of seniors and 74% of adults age 40 and over have at least one shot.\n\n15 states and Washington, D.C., have gotten at least 70% of adults one shot.\n\n26 states and D.C. have fully vaccinated 50% or more of adults.\n\nImportantly, this progress on vaccinations has brought COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths down to their lowest levels since the start of the pandemic last year. It's curbed the spread of the virus, saved tens of thousands of lives, and allowed tens of millions of Americans to get back to living their life.\n\nThis is a direct result of the Biden Administration's whole-of-government, wartime effort that focused on:\n\nSecuring enough supply for all Americans and getting it out the door as quickly as possible. When President Biden took office, there was not enough vaccine supply for all Americans, and states were not getting the supply allocation and delivery timeline information they requested and needed to be successful. Thanks to the President's aggressive actions, the Biden Administration secured enough supply for all Americans, dramatically increased supply to states, and gave states more visibility into allocation numbers to allow for better planning to get shots into arms much faster. This allowed the President to make all adults eligible for vaccination in mid-April – months ahead of expectations – and has positioned the U.S. to help lead the global efforts to vaccinate the world."}

But the House is poised to return this week as lawmakers itch to respond to Trump, who encouraged his supporters to march on the Capitol as Vice President Pence and lawmakers were formally tallying Biden's Electoral College win.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) laid out the path forward for Democrats in a \"Dear Colleague\" letter on Sunday night.\n\n\"In protecting our Constitution and our Democracy, we will act with urgency, because this President represents an imminent threat to both,\" Pelosi wrote. \"As the days go by, the horror of the ongoing assault on our democracy perpetrated by this President is intensified and so is the immediate need for action.\"\n\nPelosi, who was personally targeted by some members of the pro-Trump mob in Wednesday's insurrection, said Democrats will try to adopt Maryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin's 25th Amendment resolution on Monday by unanimous consent — a gambit sure to be blocked by Trump's conservative allies.\n\nIf that fails, Democrats will bring it to the floor on Tuesday as they try to push for Pence, who was also a target for the rioters, to respond within 24 hours. Democrats, and some Republicans, are supportive of Pence invoking the 25th Amendment, which would allow the VP and a majority of the Cabinet to sideline Trump.\n\nPelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) called Pence to discuss the issue late last week, where Schumer said they were put on hold for more than 20 minutes. They ultimately didn't connect with Pence.\n\nPelosi didn't say in her letter when the House would vote on impeaching Trump, but aides are expecting a vote as soon as Wednesday, likely on a single article. Language drafted by Reps. Raskin, David Cicilline (R.I.) and Ted Lieu (Calif.) charges Trump with high crimes and misdemeanors for \"willfully inciting violence against the Government of the United States.\"\n\nTrump would be the first president to be impeached more than once.\n\nAs of late Sunday afternoon Cicilline said he had 210 co-sponsors.\n\nIf the House votes to impeach Trump — which would mark the second time of his presidency — when Democrats would send the articles to the Senate is unclear, and could have implications for how quickly Congress can act on Biden's agenda.\n\nOutgoing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) warned in a memo to lawmakers over the weekend that an impeachment trial is unlikely to start before Biden is sworn in, meaning a trial could bog down the ability to confirm Biden's Cabinet and take up other early legislation.\n\nBiden hasn't weighed in on the impeachment talk publicly, saying that it was a decision for Congress.\n\n\"What the Congress decides to do is for them to decide, but I'm going to have to — and they're going to have to be ready to hit the ground running,\" Biden said. \"Because when [Vice President-elect Kamala Harris] and I are sworn in we're going to be introducing immediately significant pieces of legislation to deal with the virus, to deal with the economy and deal with economic growth.\"\n\nHe added that the quickest way to get Trump out of office was for him to be sworn in on Jan. 20.\n\nDemocrats will control the Senate after the 20th but they would still need significant support from Republicans to vote to convict Trump. Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) has said he is open to articles of impeachment from the House."}

The vows that we have framed in our room are just the two of us in our backyard with the Archbishop of Canterbury.\"\n\nThe duchess didn't elaborate on the private service, but many people deduced that it wasn't legally binding because of the absence of witnesses.\n\nWelby, who led the couple in their public vows on May 19, 2018, has now shed more light on events.\n\n\"The legal wedding was on the Saturday.

We not only see what has been, we see what can be,\" she said in brief remarks outside the Lincoln Memorial. \"We are bold, fearless and ambitious. We are undaunted in our belief that we shall overcome, that we will rise up.\"\n\nFor Harris, the day was steeped in history and significance in more ways than one. She was escorted to the podium by Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman, the officer who single-handedly took on a mob of Trump supporters as they tried to breach the Senate floor during the Capitol insurrection, and she was sworn in by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the first woman of color on the court, on a Bible that once belonged to former Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. She wore a deep purple dress and coat created by two emerging Black designers.\n\nHer rise is historic in any context, another moment when a stubborn boundary falls away, expanding the idea of what's possible in American politics. But it's particularly meaningful because Harris takes office at a moment when Americans are grappling over institutional racism and confronting a pandemic that has disproportionately devastated Black and brown communities.\n\nThose close to Harris say she'll bring an important — and often missing — perspective to the debates on how to overcome the many hurdles facing the new administration.\n\n\"In many folks' lifetimes, we experienced a segregated United States,\" said Lateefah Simon, a civil rights advocate and longtime Harris friend and mentee. \"You will now have a Black woman who will walk into the White House not as a guest but as a second in command of the free world.\"\n\nHarris — the child of immigrants, a stepmother of two and the wife of a Jewish man — \"carries an intersectional story of so many Americans who are never seen and heard.\"\n\nLater during the procession to the vice presidential office building, she was led by her alma mater Howard University's marching band and walked while holding the hand of her grandniece and alongside her husband, stepchildren, sister, brother-in-law and nieces.\n\nShe then quickly got to work, presiding as Senate president for the first time to swear in three new Democratic senators: Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff of Georgia and Alex Padilla of California, Harris' replacement."}

By Friday night, more than 1,900 people had expressed interest in joining.\n\nGrant, 41, estimates the number of protesters Saturday afternoon was closer to 150, which dwindled to 100 as inclement weather dampened enthusiasm.

The proceedings moved at lightning speed, with lawmakers voting just one week after violent pro-Trump loyalists stormed the U.S. Capitol, egged on by the president's calls for them to \"fight like hell\" against the election results.\n\nTen Republicans fled Trump, joining Democrats who said he needed to be held accountable and warned ominously of a \"clear and present danger\" if Congress should leave him unchecked before Democrat Joe Biden's inauguration Jan. 20.\n\nTrump is the only U.S. president to be twice impeached. It was the most bipartisan presidential impeachment in modern times, more so than against Bill Clinton in 1998.\n\nThe Capitol insurrection stunned and angered lawmakers, who were sent scrambling for safety as the mob descended, and it revealed the fragility of the nation's history of peaceful transfers of power. The riot also forced a reckoning among some Republicans, who have stood by Trump throughout his presidency and largely allowed him to spread false attacks against the integrity of the 2020 election.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi invoked Abraham Lincoln and the Bible, imploring lawmakers to uphold their oath to defend the Constitution from all enemies, foreign \"and domestic.\"\n\nShe said of Trump: \"He must go, he is a clear and present danger to the nation that we all love.\"\n\nHoled up at the White House, watching the proceedings on TV, Trump later released a video statement in which he made no mention at all of the impeachment but appealed to his supporters to refrain from any further violence or disruption of Biden's inauguration.\n\n\"Like all of you, I was shocked and deeply saddened by the calamity at the Capitol last week,\" he said, his first condemnation of the attack. He appealed for unity \"to move forward\" and said, \"Mob violence goes against everything I believe in and everything our movement stands for. ...

Here are three more he can break on Sunday:\n\nRecords Tom Brady can break at Super Bowl 55\n\nMost NFL championships\n\nBrady is already the player with the most Super Bowl rings (six), but if you include the pre-Super Bowl era then he's currently tied with three others — Fuzzy Thurston (Colts/Packers), Forrest Gregg (Packers/Cowboys) and Herb Adderly (Packers/Cowboys) — for the most NFL championships.\n\nInterestingly, the other three men did it with two teams each while all of Brady's titles came with the Patriots. If he wins on Sunday, he'll not only take sole possession of first place but he'll also get to add a second team that he's done it with.\n\nMost touchdown passes in a single Super Bowl\n\nThis is one of the few QB records Brady hasn't yet claimed, although it's once again on the table — especially with Sunday's game expected to be a shootout between the Bucs star and his counterpart, Patrick Mahomes of the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nBrady's personal best is four touchdown passes at Super Bowl XLIX, which places him in a tie for third place with Terry Bradshaw, Doug Williams and Troy Aikman. In second place is Joe Montana, who connected for five TD passes at Super Bowl XXIV.\n\nMontana's successor, Steve Young, currently holds the record with an astonishing six TD passes in Super Bowl XXIX.\n\nMost interceptions\n\nThis is really just a product of playing in so many Super Bowls, and it's obviously not something Brady will be striving for.\n\nBrady's thrown six interceptions in the nine games he's appeared in, which puts him in fourth place all time (tied with former Vikings pivot Fran Tarkenton). The leader is John Elway, who has eight INTs to his name (five games), while Craig Morton and Jim Kelly each had seven picks (in two and four games, respectively).\n\nThe fact that he's played nearly double the number of games as Elway yet still trails in this department is a testament to Brady's dominance on the grandest stage."}

In March 2020, he offered another woman $1,200 for sex, saying he would up the payment to $5,000 \"if the kids are in the room,\" the feds said.\n\nWhen chatting with someone online who admitted to sexually assaulting a baby, Griffin reassured the assailant, saying, \"You need to promise me that you will always understand what you're doing is right, OK?\" Chats show him calling young girls and babies explicit names like \"little slut,\" \"little whore,\" and \"little b—h.\"\n\nHe also sent $4,000 via Venmo to a family member of the 9-year-old he is accused of assaulting as part of an \"apparent pay-off,\" according to the feds.\n\n3 Griffin attempted to lure at least four girls, ages 16, 14, 13 and 9, to his Vermont ski house, prosecutors said. John Griffin/Twitter\n\nProsecutors said in their complaint that Griffin, of Stamford, Connecticut, attempted to lure at least four girls, ages 16, 14, 13 and 9, to his Vermont ski house for \"training sessions\" on such things as \"spanking\" and \"c–k worship,\" reportedly saying a \"woman is a woman regardless of her age.\""}

So that was not a concern at the time. So therefore, obviously no field sobriety test and no DRE,\" the sheriff added.\n\nBut former detective Jonathan Cherney, who walked the scene after the crash, also said the evidence suggests it was \"like a classic case of falling asleep behind the wheel\" because \"the road curves and his vehicle goes straight.\"\n\nIf Woods had been looking at his phone momentarily, investigators would expect to see evidence that he braked or tried to steer out of the median long before the wreck.\n\n\"Impaired people have a tendency of crashing, so if you have a situation like this one, where you have a single-vehicle crash, with out-of-the-ordinary-type circumstances, that should trigger the first responder to inquire further and to explore impairment as a possible cause of the collision,\" Cherney told the outlet.\n\nThe accident reconstructionist agreed that the fact that Woods twice told deputies he couldn't remember driving at all \"absolutely\" is a clue suggesting impairment.\n\n\"I do know significant head injuries can cause people to not know what happened or forget what happened,\" Cherney said. \"The fact that he doesn't remember driving at all is also indicative and consistent with the objective symptom of impaired driving.\"\n\nHowever, it is now too late to get access to Woods' blood and medical reports at the hospital without his cooperation or a search warrant, according to the report.\n\nTo get a warrant, police would need to convince a judge it is necessary and show probable cause that a crime had been committed — which would be \"difficult,\" Chris Taylor, managing attorney at Taylor & Taylor, a DUI defense specialist in Southern California, told USA Today Sport.\n\nThe sheriff's department eventually executed a search warrant to obtain the \"black box\" data from the SUV that could show how fast Woods was traveling, plus any braking or steering activity prior to impact.\n\nThe department has not released any of the findings.\n\nDuring emergency surgery at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Woods had a rod inserted into his tibia and pins and screws in his foot and ankle. Three days later, he was transferred to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and underwent follow-up procedures."}

Small numbers of U.S. special forces and CIA agents soon slip into Afghanistan to help direct the bombing campaign and organise Afghan opposition forces. the Taliban would swiftly be toppled, however, with no major U.S. combat deployment on the ground.\n\nNov. 13, 2001 - U.S.-backed Northern Alliance forces enter Kabul as the Taliban withdraw south. Within a month, Taliban leaders have fled from southern Afghanistan into Pakistan.\n\nDecember 2001 - U.S. forces bomb the Tora Bora cave complex in eastern Afghanistan where bin Laden is reported to be hiding, but he slips over the border into Pakistan, where he disappears.\n\nMay 2, 2003 - U.S. officials declare an end to major combat operations in Afghanistan. Under President George W. Bush, the U.S. focus turns to preparing for the invasion of Iraq, which required a diversion of U.S. troops, equipment, and intelligence collection from Afghanistan. That allows the Taliban to slowly regroup, at first in the south and east.\n\n2006-2008 - With U.S. forces mainly fighting a surge campaign in Iraq, only a much smaller contingent is deployed in Afghanistan. The Taliban launch major advances threatening to recapture swaths of territory, especially in the south. In response, an enlarged NATO mission brings thousands more troops, notably British forces, hundreds of whom are killed in intense battles against the Taliban in Helmand province."}

EPA\n\n\"Global trade is at worldwide highs right now. Cargo is moving through the Suez Canal at record rates,\" said Salvatore Mercogliano, a maritime historian at Campbell University in North Carolina, at the time.\n\n\"In many ways, the Suez Canal is the only game in town in terms of these really large vessels going through and because it's such a substantial shortcut between Europe and Asia,\" he said.\n\nDrone footage captures efforts to free Ever Given in Suez Canal\n\nAbout 12 per cent of global trade — $10bn to $12bn a day — goes through the canal.\n\nThat year saw daily transit records broken, with 87 ships crossing the waterway on September 29. In November 2021, the canal authority recorded its highest monthly revenue of $571.3 million.\n\nWith such successes, it is perhaps even more important to review the lessons learnt to avoid a scenario similar to the Ever Given grounding in the future.\n\nA long history\n\nOpened on November 17, 1869, the canal recently celebrated 152 years in existence. During that time, 1.4 million ships carrying 24.7 billion tonnes of cargo navigated the waterway, paying fees of $147.1bn.\n\nThere have been other instances of ships running aground and blocking the canal, but none for as long as the Ever Given. Russian oil tanker Tropic Brilliance got stuck for three days in 2004 and the Hong Kong-flagged Okal King Dor blocked transit for eight hours in 2006.\n\n\"[The Ever Given grounding] was a one-off incident, which did cause a drastic disruption to trade. But if we look realistically over the past century of the operation of the canal, there have hardly been any incidents,\" said Ranjith Raja, oil research manager at Refinitiv.\n\nIn 2015, President Abdel Fattah El Sisi inaugurated the New Suez Canal, a second lane along part of the 193-kilometre waterway to allow for more ships to pass. The canal was also widened and deepened in other stretches.\n\nFurther canal expansion a necessity\n\nThe Ever Given ran aground during a sandstorm and strong winds in the southern stretch of the waterway, the longest single-lane portion.\n\n\"The most important thing is to create more two-lane segments in the canal,\" said Mohamed El Wakeel, vice dean of the College of Maritime Transport and Technology at the Arab Academy for Science, Technology and Transport.\n\nIn May, the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) announced plans to widen and deepen the 30km stretch of waterway between the city of Suez and the Bitter Lake area by 2023.\n\nTwo-directional traffic in the canal lane further north will also be extended by 10km to a total length of 82km.\n\nContainer ships aren't getting any smaller\n\nThe Ever Given is one of the largest container ships ever built, nearly as long as the Empire State Building is tall. It is right at the maximum length allowed for transit in the Suez Canal.\n\nWhile its grounding brought into question whether such vessels are too big to safely operate in many ports and canals, it did not deter the construction of ultra-large ships.\n\n\"In the midst of Ever Given being stuck in the Suez, Ever Green, the ship's parent company, ordered vessels even larger than Ever Given at that same time,\" said Mr Mercogliano.\n\nAs long as major passages can accommodate these larger vessels, shipping companies will continue to build them, and vice versa. In May, the Panama Canal Authority increased the maximum length of ships allowed to pass through the waterway from 367 to 370 metres.\n\n\"From a trade perspective, it makes sense to have bigger vessels, which are capable of carrying more cargo and makes the overall cost of trade significantly lower,\" said Mr Raja.\n\nThe 'Ever Given', one of the world's largest container ships, sails in the Suez Canal after authorities agreed to a settlement with the vessel's owner and insurers."}

It was recorded as 8 minutes, 46 seconds in an initial criminal complaint — a figure that became symbolic to many in the weeks after Floyd's death — before a math error was corrected to make it 7:46. But filings since then, citing time-stamped police body-camera video, now make it at least nine minutes.\n\nThe fact that the figure has evolved probably won't matter at Chauvin's trial, which begins Monday with jury selection. One former prosecutor says it's common for such details to be fine-tuned as prosecutors build a case. A support group for victims of police violence says the discrepancies won't have any impact.\n\n\"He was obviously on there enough time to think about what he was doing. He heard the man pleading that he couldn't breathe,\" said Toshira Garraway, founder of Families Supporting Families Against Police Violence. \"If it was two minutes or if it was five minutes or if it was 10 minutes, he was fully aware ... Once he said, 'I cannot breathe' ... he was supposed to remove his knee.\"\n\nFloyd died May 25. He had been handcuffed and was pleading that he couldn't breathe, but Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd's neck even after he stopped moving and speaking.\n\nChauvin is charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter. Three other officers — Thomas Lane, J. Kueng and Tou Thao — are charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter and are scheduled for trial in August.\n\nThe narrative in the initial complaint filed May 29 by the Hennepin County Attorney's Office says Chauvin held his knee to Floyd's neck for 8 minutes, 46 seconds. But the time stamps cited in that charging document indicate it was actually 7 minutes, 46 seconds.\n\nThe Associated Press began asking about the error the day after the initial charges were filed, but prosecutors repeatedly declined to address it. The 8:46 detail was repeated in an amended complaint filed days later by the Attorney General's Office.\n\nIn the weeks that followed Floyd's death, some demonstrators staged \"die-ins\" that lasted 8 minutes, 46 seconds, some lawmakers knelt for that amount of time in the U.S. Senate, and mourners at a memorial service for Floyd stood in silence for 8:46 to reflect on the final moments of his life.\n\nIn mid-June, prosecutors acknowledged the one-minute error, but said it would have no impact on the case.\n\nDocuments filed by prosecutors in September and October changed the timing yet again. These documents contain the most detailed picture of what happened, citing time stamps from Lane, Keung and Thao's body camera videos.\n\nThe documents don't list an exact time for when Chauvin began kneeling on Floyd, but instead provide a narrative for when Floyd was first pressed to the ground. Time stamps on video from Lane's body camera — recorded in 24-hour-clock format — show that began at some point from 20:19:14 to 20:19:45, meaning from 14 to 45 seconds after 8:19 p.m.\n\nBut the documents cite a clear moment when Chauvin removed his knee, when a stretcher was ready to take Floyd away. Lane's body camera time-stamp read 20:28:45."}
{"id": "articles-cleaned-truncated/news-2021-01-01-2021-12-31-kabulairportattack/art-028", "text": "Remarks by President Biden on Afghanistan\n\nGood afternoon. I want to speak today to the unfolding situation in Afghanistan: the developments that have taken place in the last week and the steps we're taking to address the rapidly evolving events.\n\nMy national security team and I have been closely monitoring the situation on the ground in Afghanistan and moving quickly to execute the plans we had put in place to respond to every constituency, including — and contingency — including the rapid collapse we're seeing now.\n\nI'll speak more in a moment about the specific steps we're taking, but I want to remind everyone how we got here and what America's interests are in Afghanistan.\n\nWe went to Afghanistan almost 20 years ago with clear goals: get those who attacked us on September 11th, 2001, and make sure al Qaeda could not use Afghanistan as a base from which to attack us again.\n\nWe did that. We severely degraded al Qaeda in Afghanistan. We never gave up the hunt for Osama bin Laden, and we got him. That was a decade ago.\n\nOur mission in Afghanistan was never supposed to have been nation building. It was never supposed to be creating a unified, centralized democracy.\n\nOur only vital national interest in Afghanistan remains today what it has always been: preventing a terrorist attack on American homeland.\n\nI've argued for many years that our mission should be narrowly focused on counterterrorism — not counterinsurgency or nation building. That's why I opposed the surge when it was proposed in 2009 when I was Vice President.\n\nAnd that's why, as President, I am adamant that we focus on the threats we face today in 2021 — not yesterday's threats.\n\nToday, the terrorist threat has metastasized well beyond Afghanistan: al Shabaab in Somalia, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, al-Nusra in Syria, ISIS attempting to create a caliphate in Syria and Iraq and establishing affiliates in multiple countries in Africa and Asia. These threats warrant our attention and our resources.\n\nWe conduct effective counterterrorism missions against terrorist groups in multiple countries where we don't have a permanent military presence.\n\nIf necessary, we will do the same in Afghanistan. We've developed counterterrorism over-the-horizon capability that will allow us to keep our eyes firmly fixed on any direct threats to the United States in the region and to act quickly and decisively if needed.\n\nWhen I came into office, I inherited a deal that President Trump negotiated with the Taliban. Under his agreement, U.S. forces would be out of Afghanistan by May 1, 2021 — just a little over three months after I took office.\n\nU.S. forces had already drawn down during the Trump administration from roughly 15,500 American forces to 2,500 troops in country, and the Taliban was at its strongest militarily since 2001.\n\nThe choice I had to make, as your President, was either to follow through on that agreement or be prepared to go back to fighting the Taliban in the middle of the spring fighting season.\n\nThere would have been no ceasefire after May 1. There was no agreement protecting our forces after May 1. There was no status quo of stability without American casualties after May 1.\n\nThere was only the cold reality of either following through on the agreement to withdraw our forces or escalating the conflict and sending thousands more American troops back into combat in Afghanistan, lurching into the third decade of conflict.\n\nI stand squarely behind my decision. After 20 years, I've learned the hard way that there was never a good time to withdraw U.S. forces.\n\nThat's why we were still there. We were clear-eyed about the risks. We planned for every contingency.\n\nBut I always promised the American people that I will be straight with you. The truth is: This did unfold more quickly than we had anticipated.\n\nSo what's happened? Afghanistan political leaders gave up and fled the country. The Afghan military collapsed, sometimes without trying to fight.\n\nIf anything, the developments of the past week reinforced that ending U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan now was the right decision.\n\nAmerican troops cannot and should not be fighting in a war and dying in a war that Afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves. We spent over a trillion dollars. We trained and equipped an Afghan military force of some 300,000 strong — incredibly well equipped — a force larger in size than the militaries of many of our NATO allies.\n\nWe gave them every tool they could need. We paid their salaries, provided for the maintenance of their air force — something the Taliban doesn't have. Taliban does not have an air force. We provided close air support.\n\nWe gave them every chance to determine their own future. What we could not provide them was the will to fight for that future.\n\nThere's some very brave and capable Afghan special forces units and soldiers, but if Afghanistan is unable to mount any real resistance to the Taliban now, there is no chance that 1 year — 1 more year, 5 more years, or 20 more years of U.S. military boots on the ground would've made any difference.\n\nAnd here's what I believe to my core: It is wrong to order American troops to step up when Afghanistan's own armed forces would not. If the political leaders of Afghanistan were unable to come together for the good of their people, unable to negotiate for the future of their country when the chips were down, they would never have done so while U.S. troops remained in Afghanistan bearing the brunt of the fighting for them.\n\nAnd our true strategic competitors — China and Russia — would love nothing more than the United States to continue to funnel billions of dollars in resources and attention into stabilizing Afghanistan indefinitely.\n\nWhen I hosted President Ghani and Chairman Abdullah at the White House in June and again when I spoke by phone to Ghani in July, we had very frank conversations. We talked about how Afghanistan should prepare to fight their civil wars after the U.S. military departed, to clean up the corruption in government so the government could function for the Afghan people. We talked extensively about the need for Afghan leaders to unite politically.\n\nThey failed to do any of that.\n\nI also urged them to engage in diplomacy, to seek a political settlement with the Taliban. This advice was flatly refused. Mr. Ghani insisted the Afghan forces would fight, but obviously he was wrong.\n\nSo I'm left again to ask of those who argue that we should stay: How many more generations of America's daughters and sons would you have me send to fight Afghans — Afghanistan's civil war when Afghan troops will not? How many more lives — American lives — is it worth? How many endless rows of headstones at Arlington National Cemetery?\n\nI'm clear on my answer: I will not repeat the mistakes we've made in the past — the mistake of staying and fighting indefinitely in a conflict that is not in the national interest of the United States, of doubling down on a civil war in a foreign country, of attempting to remake a country through the endless military deployments of U.S. forces.\n\nThose are the mistakes we cannot continue to repeat, because we have significant vital interests in the world that we cannot afford to ignore.\n\nI also want to acknowledge how painful this is to so many of us. The scenes we're seeing in Afghanistan, they're gut-wrenching, particularly for our veterans, our diplomats, humanitarian workers, for anyone who has spent time on the ground working to support the Afghan people."}

Security around the airport was crumbling, and the future of my Afghan colleagues was increasingly uncertain. They had received Taliban threats in the past, and both have young families for whom they fear the most.\n\nReaching the airport would be the most difficult part, and it was something we decided we had to do together.\n\nWe hadn't seen each other since the Taliban took over the capital, and the reunion — after so much anxiety, fear and change — was emotional. On a dusty gravel road lined by concrete barriers outside the airport, we embraced. It was one of the first moments of joy and relief in a long time. Everyone was in tears.\n\nNext, we had to make a run for the military side of the airport, a part of the city quickly becoming the most dangerous.\n\nThe night before, Taliban fighters had stormed a crowd waiting outside the terminal, beating men, women and children attempting to flee the country. By morning, the militants had set up checkpoints and deployed dozens of fighters to block roads leading to the airport. One of those checkpoints was a just a few hundred yards from the compound where I was staying.\n\n\"Why do you want to leave the country? What are you, traitors?\" the militants screamed at a crowd forming beside one of the main airport entrances, known as Abbey gate, in a scene witnessed by Washington Post reporter Aziz Tassal.

Our chances of making it through the gate safely and then onto the plane were slim. But the crowds at the airport were growing by the day, and the Taliban was becoming more brutal. We decided it was worth a shot.\n\nWe were traveling with eight small children, the youngest not even a year old, and were most concerned about their safety. Two nights before, Tassal and his young daughter were beaten by Taliban fighters as they waited on the civilian side of the airport for a flight that never materialized. That experience, my colleagues later said, only hardened their resolve to escape, but it left their families terrified of returning to the scene.\n\n\"I will never forget how they beat my small daughter,\" Tassal said, showing me the dark blue bruise on her side. \"They will never change. My country is gone forever.\"\n\nIt was possible that we could experience a repeat of that night. But I felt that if I was with the group — the only Post employee left in the country with an American passport — we would be more likely to get inside the base. And if we rented armored cars, we would be partially protected from an attack if the road was breached."}

AP Photo/Darron Cummings\n\nIn the seventh episode of the Tom Brady documentary, \"Man in the Arena,\" the 44-year-old quarterback's family receives some focus while the story of the 2016 Patriots is recounted.\n\nInterwoven with details about one of New England's most celebrated championships—culminating with the comeback from a 28-3 deficit in Super Bowl LI — Brady's three older sisters chronicle both his career and growth off the field from their unique perspective.\n\nMaureen, Julie, and Nancy Brady joined their brother to be interviewed for the episode, discussing the team's on-field success simultaneous to the more personal story of their mother battling cancer.\n\nHere are a few takeaways from Episode 7, titled, \"Surrender\":\n\nThe Brady family view of \"Deflategate\"\n\nAfter receiving coverage in the previous episode, the \"Deflategate\" controversy was once again back in the documentary as Brady's 2016 four-game suspension was discussed.\n\nIn Brady's view, the entire subplot was \"a lot about who had power and authority.\"\n\n\"What it started out as vs. what it became were two totally different things,\" he explained.\n\nBrady's siblings shared that view, noting that accusations drifted over time as the initial reports of discrepancies in the pressure of footballs were seemingly disproven by the ideal gas law.\n\n\"A lot of people were waiting for that moment to kind of dig in,\" said Nancy. \"It was vicious.\"\n\nUltimately, Brady believed that it wasn't productive to continuously defend his actions.\n\n\"I don't need to defend myself,\" he said. \"I've defended myself for a long time. I said what I had to say multiple times, in front of a lot of different people, in court, in public. I felt I had given them what they needed to make the right decision, but I feel like they had their mind made up.\"\n\n\"I realized I wasn't going to win,\" Brady said of the protracted court procedure. \"It's hard to beat 31 billionaires in court. I thought we gave it a great fight but in the end just dealing with the results of what the New York circuit judge decided. I decided to put that behind me and then move on to the next year.\"\n\nBrady's response to his mother having cancer\n\nWhile the 2016 season was ultimately a happy memory for Patriots fans, it was a difficult time for the Brady family. When asked what came to mind about the year, Maureen became emotional.\n\n\"That was a hard year,\" she recalled. \"That was a really hard year. We had a lot going on with my mom and Tommy.\"\n\nGalynn Brady was diagnosed with breast cancer and myeloma in 2016. She immediately began to receive treatment, which eventually meant a difficult period of chemotherapy.\n\nBrady offered an introspective recollection from that time.\n\n\"I tried to remain poised and say, 'Don't worry, mom, we're going to get through it,'\" said Brady. \"And then I automatically — maybe it's a little bit of a toughening up that I've had, but maybe I'm not the most empathetic or sympathetic — I'm trying to solve it.\n\n\"I'm saying, 'Mom, come on, this is what we've got to do, we've got to send you to this person, or this person,'\" Brady continued. \"We're going to fix this.\"\n\nHandling the 2016 suspension\n\nHaving to serve a four-game suspension at the outset of the 2016 season provided a stark change of pace for Brady.\n\n\"It was the first September that I'd had off since my eighth-grade year,\" Brady recalled. \"I didn't even know what a September was like without football.\n\nBrady said that he decided to go on vacation to Costa Rica to be with his wife.\n\n\"That was really good for our relationship,\" he said of the trip with Gisele Bündchen.\n\n\"A very small gesture like that allowed me to recognize the things that I need to do in our relationship to make sure that she feels supported too,\" said Brady, \"because she'd supported me for the previous year and a half. She held me up when I was weak and angry and sad and depressed. That was a really dark time.\"\n\nBut after the brutal period of \"Deflategate,\" the suspension that finally resulted from it was a positive moment.\n\n\"It actually worked out awesome for them,\" said Maureen. \"He saw our family. We haven't had a family holiday together since he was at Michigan.\"\n\nWatching Jimmy Garoppolo start the season at quarterback\n\nBrady said he was working out while watching backup quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo and the Patriots play the Cardinals in the opening game of the 2016 season."}

(Video: The Washington Post)\n\nThe president and his supporters also have lost accounts on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitch, Spotify, Shopify and others. Facebook called Trump's suspension \"indefinite\" but left open the possibility that the account could later be restored.\n\nThe findings, from Jan. 9 through Friday, highlight how falsehoods flow across social media sites — reinforcing and amplifying each other — and offer an early indication of how concerted actions against misinformation can make a difference.\n\nTwitter's ban of Trump on Jan. 8, after years in which @realDonaldTrump was a potent online megaphone, has been particularly significant in curbing his ability to push misleading claims about what state and federal officials have called a free and fair election on Nov. 3.\n\nTrump's banishment was followed by other actions by social media sites, including Twitter's ban of more than 70,000 accounts affiliated with the baseless QAnon ideology, which played a key role in fomenting the Capitol siege on Jan. 6.\n\n\"Together, those actions will likely significantly reduce the amount of online misinformation in the near term,\" said Kate Starbird, disinformation researcher at the University of Washington. \"What happens in the long term is still up in the air.\"\n\nZignal found that the use of hashtags affiliated with the Capitol riot also dipped considerably. Mentions of the hashtag #FightforTrump, which was widely deployed across Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and other social media services in the week before the rally, dropped 95 percent. #HoldTheLine and the term \"March for Trump\" also fell more than 95 percent.\n\nThe research by Zignal and other groups suggests that a powerful, integrated disinformation ecosystem — composed of high-profile influencers, rank-and-file followers and Trump himself — was central to pushing millions of Americans to reject the election results and may have trouble surviving without his social media accounts."}

Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao. The trial was scheduled for August.\n\nThen came a surprise: prosecutors announced that a grand jury had indicted all four officers on federal charges of violating Floyd's civil rights. With the announcement of federal charges, Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill moved the state trial of Kueng, Lane and Thao to March of 2022.\n\nNow, the focus in the case is on the charges brought by the federal government. Here's what we know about what the officers are charged with and how the federal trials will go.\n\nWhat are the officers charged with?\n\nChauvin, Kueng, Lane and Thao were indicted on charges of violating Section 242 of Title 18 of U.S. Code, or depriving Floyd of his rights under the color of law.\n\nThe first count in the indictment charges Chauvin, describing him holding Floyd down with his knee on his neck, resulting in his death, with violating Floyd's right to be free from unreasonable seizure, \"which includes the right to be free from the use of unreasonable force by a police officer.\"\n\nThe second count concerns Thao and Kueng, alleging they \"willfully failed to intervene\" to stop Chauvin from using unreasonable force which resulted in Floyd's death.\n\nThe third charge, which names all four officers involved, alleges they violated Floyd's right \"not to be deprived of liberty without to due process of law, which includes an arrestee's right to be free from a police officer's deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs.\" It goes on to allege Floyd was in \"clear need of medical care\" and that by \"willfully\" failing to help, they acted with \"deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of harm to Floyd.\"\n\nIn a separate indictment involving an incident from 2017, Chauvin is charged with two counts of violating the same section of law. These counts involve a 2017 incident with a then-14-year-old who the document says Chauvin held by the throat, struck in the head with a flashlight multiple times and pinned down with his knee despite lack of resistance, resulting in injury.\n\nAre federal civil rights charges like these common?\n\nCivil rights charges like these are relatively rare: Syracuse University found that between 1990 and 2019, federal prosecutors brought roughly 41 of them each year, representing a tiny fraction of federal prosecutions.\n\nMark Osler, a former federal prosecutor and professor at the University of St. Thomas School of Law, said it's more typical to see an officer charged with federal civil rights violations if they are acquitted in state court, as in the case of the officers who beat Rodney King in Los Angeles in 1992 and in the case of Michael Slager, the police officer who shot and killed Walter Scott in South Carolina in 2015.\n\nIn fact, the Star Tribune reported that the Justice Department planned to arrest Chauvin at the courthouse on federal charges if he were acquitted of the state ones. When he was convicted, the federal charges came out later.\n\nWhat do the feds have to prove to convict the officers?\n\nThe section the officers are charged with violating describes a person \"willfully\" violating the rights of another under the color of law, meaning acting or pretending to act within their line of duty. It can be applied to police officers, prison guards, judges and other officials."}

During that three-month period, Facebook reported about $29 billion in revenue. That means that Facebook makes roughly $319.6 million per day in revenue, $13.3 million per hour, $220,000 per minute, and $3,700 per second. The outlets then used those numbers to calculate revenue loss based on how long the outage has lasted.\n\nThe estimates underscore the financial impact of a massive outage on Facebook's ad business. The company said it's working on restoring its services, but hasn't said what's causing the outage. Facebook is currently back up for some people.\n\n\"We're aware that some people are having trouble accessing our apps and products. We're working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible, and we apologize for any inconvenience,\" Facebook tweeted about six hours ago.\n\nAs of roughly 3:30 p.m. PT/6:30 p.m. ET, Facebook services were slowly coming back online, the social network said. \"To the huge community of people and businesses around the world who depend on us: we're sorry,\" the company tweeted. \"We've been working hard to restore access to our apps and services and are happy to report they are coming back online now. Thank you for bearing with us.\"\n\nLost revenue wasn't the only financial problem Facebook encountered on Monday.

In a March 24 statement, Evergreen said gusty winds of about 56 kph had caused the ship's course to deviate.\n\nEvergreen had been all but free of accidents before last week, company followers say. They point to the discipline of Evergreen founder Chang Yung-fa, who died in 2016 at the age of 88.\n\nA native of a Taiwanese coastal village during Japan's 1895-1945 colonization, Chang worked at age 18 for a Japanese shipping line in Taipei and became third officer of a Taiwanese shipper after World War II. He eventually worked as a captain and helped start a marine shipping firm with friends before establishing Evergreen Marine on his own.\n\nChang launched the company in 1968 with a single second-hand ship. Evergreen's operating fleet has 200 container ships today.\n\nChang received a Japanese education when Japan colonized Taiwan from 1895 to 1945. That education fostered a management style that thrived on strict adherence to rules and allowed employees to find work offshore, people who follow the company say.\n\n\"The former owner, Mr. Chang Yung-fa, was educated in the style of the Japanese, so his method of management was like that of Japan,\" said Stone Huang, Taiwan managing director with the freight forwarding service JAS Worldwide. He works closely today with Evergreen staffers.\n\n\"So it was strict, plus his financial support was strong and a lot of the staff that turned over would go overseas,\" Huang said.\n\nEvergreen Marine, part of a transport-logistics conglomerate that includes Eva Airways, was shaken when the late founder's sons went to court over how to divide an inheritance, domestic media outlets reported. At stake was a $1.87 billion fortune. Three sons inherited the group of companies and an employee who had risen up since 1987 now runs the marine shipping side.\n\nThe marine shipper may be playing by different rules now compared to before Chang's death, said Liang Kuo-yuan, president of the Polaris Research Institute research organization in Taipei.\n\n\"The way of operating now I believe is not as top-down as it was under the Chang Yung-fa era,\" Liang said. \"When Chang said something, no one wouldn't dare not to do it.\n\n\"If he was still alive, I believe Chang would take on the whole thing himself,\" Liang added, referring to the Suez Canal mishap.\n\nEvergreen is leasing the Ever Given, the 20,000 twenty-ton equivalent cargo ship that got stuck March 23 in the canal and held up billions of dollars of freight every day. The company said its vessel was freed Monday afternoon.\n\nCompany spokespeople did not reply Monday to questions about the incident's impact on the company's reputation. Evergreen said in a statement Monday it would \"coordinate with the shipowner to deal with subsequent matters after the shipowner and other concerned parties complete investigation reports into the incident.\""}

There was still electricity when Le arrived at Nguyen's home, but it didn't last long. The electricity was cut hours later, and the family lit the fireplace to keep warm during the winter storm. They played cards during the blackout and by 9:30 p.m., they all prepared for bed.\n\n\"Tucked my kids into bed and really the next thing I know I'm in the hospital,\" she said. \"A few hours later the fireman and police officer came and said that no one else made it.\"\n\nIt took fire officials two hours to fully contain the flame.

Even though she was only 11, Nguyen described her as \"mature\" and \"so ahead of her peers.\"\n\nEdison, her middle child and who also had mild autism, was a \"sweet boy\" who was interested in modern art and architecture. \"He just had a very deep appreciation for any visual aesthetics,\" Nguyen said. \"So kind and so caring and so thoughtful. ... You wouldn't think an 8-year-old had that level of depth.\"\n\nLe, a refugee from Vietnam, did all she could do to help her daughter by taking care of her grandchildren. She helped pick them up and drop them off for school and extracurriculars while Nguyen focused on reaching her professional goal in finance.\n\n\"My parents did everything for their kids, like, as immigrants, and coming to this country and then, that love that they gave me, it was tenfold when it came to the grandkids,\" Nguyen said. \"I think grandmas are unsung heroes and untold stories.\"\n\nOther details: Two GoFundMe campaigns have been set up to honor Nguyen's three children, according to KHOU11.\n\nThe crowndfunding campaign will pay tribute to their memories with all proceeds donated to various charities that interest them, including performing and visuals arts, autism awareness, and reading and literacy.\n\n\"Our hearts are broken right now.

Others saw a well-meaning young man who had gone to keep the peace and provide medical aid, a response to the sometimes destructive protests that had roiled American cities in the summer of 2020.\n\nImage Justin Blake, upper left, Jacob Blake's uncle, and others listen to the verdict while standing outside the Kenosha County Courthouse. Credit... Carlos Javier Ortiz for The New York Times\n\n\"So many people look at this case and they see what they want to see,\" Thomas Binger, the prosecutor in the trial, had cautioned jurors before they began deliberations.\n\nThe case reflected the sharp split in the country, and political leaders and others weighed in almost immediately, conservatives deeming it a win for the notion of self-defense and liberals labeling it a failure of the criminal justice system.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom of California, said the verdict served as a message to \"armed vigilantes\" that \"you can break the law, carry around weapons built for a military, shoot and kill people, and get away with it.\"\n\nPresident Biden said the acquittal would \"leave many Americans feeling angry and concerned, myself included,\" but he also urged demonstrators to remain peaceful. \"I stand by what the jury has concluded,\" he told reporters earlier. \"The jury system works, and we have to abide by it.\"\n\nRepublicans, like Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, said that \"justice has been served.\" Rebecca Kleefisch, the leading Republican candidate for Wisconsin governor, said that \"the justice system worked\" and called the prosecution \"a complete disgrace.\"\n\nShortly after noon on Friday, the jury forewoman, wearing a jean jacket and a face mask, handed the verdicts to a court official, who passed them to Judge Bruce Schroeder for review. As the verdict was read, Mr. Rittenhouse's mother and sisters cried, and friends and family of the men Mr. Rittenhouse fatally shot clutched each other's hands and wept. Several jurors, appearing fatigued, shifted uncomfortably in their seats or folded their arms across their chests.\n\nOutside the courthouse, quiet gave way to shouts from supporters of Mr. Rittenhouse. Gov. Tony Evers had prepared for any unrest after the verdict by authorizing 500 Wisconsin Army National Guard troops. As evening fell, only a few demonstrators holding signs remained on the courthouse steps."}

In the coming weeks, a group of Senate Democrats, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), will send a letter to urge Biden to support recurring stimulus checks until the Covid-19 pandemic is over.\n\n\"We urge you to include recurring direct payments and automatic unemployment insurance extensions tied to economic conditions in your Build Back Better long-term economic plan,\" the senators write. \"This crisis is far from over, and families deserve certainty that they can put food on the table and keep a roof over their heads. Families should not be at the mercy of constantly-shifting legislative timelines and ad hoc solutions.\"\n\nWhile the letter doesn't specify a dollar amount or frequency of the stimulus checks, some of the senators previously supported $2,000 stimulus checks every month for the duration of the Covid-19 pandemic. (Vice President Kamala Harris, who didn't sign the letter, supported $2,000 monthly stimulus checks when she was a U.S. senator). Will Congress renew this policy proposal?

It can't be made impervious to water,\" Lieber said. \"We just need to limit how quickly it can get into the system.\"\n\nIn Boston, climate change efforts have focused largely on the Blue Line, which runs beneath Boston Harbor and straddles the shoreline north of the city.\n\nThis summer's storms were the first real test of some of the newest measures to buffer the vulnerable line.\n\nFlood barriers at a key downtown waterfront stop were activated for the first time when Tropical Storm Henri made landfall in New England in August.

He attached to the tweet a Guardian article that made no such claim.\n\nPowell, who died this week, was the US secretary of state who privately doubted the George W. Bush administration's case for war against Iraq, but agreed to argue in the United Nations for war, citing flawed US intelligence that Iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction. Powell did not cite Israeli intelligence. By the time Powell delivered the speech, he himself said years later, Bush was already determined to go to war.\n\nChallenged by others on Twitter, Samirah doubled down, blaming Israel as well for the 1980s Iran-Iraq war, and attaching a 1986 article from The New York Times revealing weapons deals between Israel and the Shah of Iran. The Shah deposed in 1979 was dead in September 1980 when Iraq launched the war against the Islamist regime that replaced him.\n\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms\n\nSamirah, who joined a historically Jewish fraternity in college and helped found a campus chapter of the Jewish anti-Zionist group Jewish Voice for Peace, also tweeted, \"It's anti-Semitic to confuse Judaism, a whole religion, with Zionism, an ethno-religious supremacist ideology heavily used by Israel to advance it's [sic] well-documented, inhumane 70+ year military aggression against Palestinians.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for Del. Eileen Filler-Corn, the Jewish Democrat who is the Speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates, did not return a request for comment.

The UK media abides by the Independent Press Standards Organisation's Code of Conduct 'to avoid prejudicial or pejorative reference to an individual's race', as well as by rigorous defamation laws. And rightly so – the British press doesn't always get it right. But social media is the Wild West by comparison, publishing vile slurs on a daily basis with impunity.\n\nSome therefore find it strange that such a litigious couple would claim to have been 'silenced' when they have made so many complaints, including resorting to legal action, over stories they claim not to have even read. There is something similarly contradictory about a couple accusing the tabloids of lacking self-reflection while refusing to take any blame at all – for anything.\n\nIn any normal world, informed writing on such matters would be classed as fair comment, but not, seemingly, on Twitter where those completely lacking any objectivity whatsoever are only too willing to virtue signal and manoeuvre.\n\nAs the trolling reached fever pitch in the aftermath of the interview, veteran royal reporter Robert Jobson of the Evening Standard called me. 'Don't respond to these freaks,' he advised. 'It's getting nasty out there. Watch your back!'\n\nYet despite my general sense of bewilderment at the menacing Megbots, I can't say it didn't appal me to discover a close friend had received online abuse, purely by dint of being my mate. After discussing the lengths the troll must have gone to to track her down, she asked me, 'Do you ever worry someone might do something awful to you?' Er, not until now, no.\n\nOf course it's upsetting, even for a cynical old-timer like me. Worse still are people who actually know me casting aspersions on my profession on social media. Often these are the same charlatans who would think nothing of sidling up to me for the latest gossip on the Royal family, while publicly pretending that reading any such coverage is completely beneath them.\n\nMost pernicious of all though – not least after Piers Morgan's departure from Good Morning Britain following a complaint to ITV and Ofcom from the Duchess – is the corrosive effect this whole hullabaloo is having on freedom of speech. When you've got a former actor effectively editing a British breakfast show from an £11 million Montecito mansion, what next?\n\nI cannot help but think we are in danger of setting race relations back 30 years if people are seriously suggesting that any criticism of Meghan is racially motivated. It's the hypocrisy that gets me. When Priti Patel was accused of bullying, the very same people who willingly hung the Home Secretary out to dry are now the ones defending Meghan against such claims, saying they have been levelled at her simply because she is 'a strong woman of colour'.\n\nOf course journalists should take responsibility for everything they report and be held to account for it – but Harry and Meghan do not have a monopoly on the truth simply because the close friend and neighbour who interviewed them in return for £7 million from CBS took what they said as gospel."}

Andrew Cuomo.\n\nA second hour of \"Anderson Cooper 360\" aired in Cuomo's place on Tuesday night. A town hall about Covid-19 will air Wednesday night.\n\nTuesday's announcement about the suspension was the equivalent of a cable news shockwave. Cuomo's 9 p.m. program is frequently CNN's most-watched hour of the day. He is a larger-than-life presence at the network. And he was determined to stay on TV this year despite a flurry of sexual misconduct allegations against his brother, which culminated in the governor's resignation three months ago.\n\nBut new documents released on Monday showed that the veteran journalist was more intimately involved than previously known in shaping his brother's defense.\n\n\"The New York Attorney General's office released transcripts and exhibits Monday that shed new light on Chris Cuomo's involvement in his brother's defense,\" a CNN spokesperson said Tuesday evening. \"The documents, which we were not privy to before their public release, raise serious questions.\"\n\n\"When Chris admitted to us that he had offered advice to his brother's staff, he broke our rules and we acknowledged that publicly,\" the spokesperson continued. \"But we also appreciated the unique position he was in and understood his need to put family first and job second.\"\n\n\"However, these documents point to a greater level of involvement in his brother's efforts than we previously knew,\" the spokesperson added. \"As a result, we have suspended Chris indefinitely, pending further evaluation.\"\n\nThe spokesperson did not share any further details, but it's possible that Cuomo will remain on the bench for weeks.\n\nThe anchorman declined to comment on Tuesday night, but he took to his radio show Wednesday to address the suspension.\n\n\"It hurts to even say it. It's embarrassing,\" he said on his SiriusXM show. \"But I understand it.\"\n\nChris Cuomo said that he never wanted to \"compromise any of my colleagues\" and said he will respect the process evaluating his conduct. He added he will refrain from talking about the issue further.\n\nThe suspension came after significant criticism from people who noted that Cuomo had violated widely accepted journalistic norms. Inside CNN, some staffers expressed dismay about the anchor's conduct. Charlotte Bennett, a former aide to Andrew Cuomo who came forward in February to accuse him of sexual harassment, called for CNN to \"immediately take action.\"\n\n\"Anything short of firing Chris Cuomo reflects a network lacking both morals and a backbone,\" Bennett said in a tweet Tuesday.\n\nThe \"Cuomo Prime Time\" team had been planning for Tuesday's broadcast up until the suspension announcement around 6:15 p.m. Eastern, a person familiar with the matter said. Cooper's team was also blindsided by the news and left scrambling to fill the extra hour.\n\nAfter the news was made public, an emotional Chris Cuomo met with the show's staff.\n\nWhile many media critics said the suspension was necessary, some viewers expressed disappointment that he was taken off the air.\n\nCNN has not said what will fill the time slot while Cuomo is sidelined.\n\nThe documents released by New York Attorney General Letitia James on Monday included text messages and transcripts of interviews with investigators who led the probe into allegations against the governor."}

That method is known as \"excess fatalities\" and has been employed during other disasters, like the COVID-19 pandemic, to estimate related death tolls.\n\n\"Our analysis, reviewed by three independent experts, suggests that between 426 and 978 more people than expected died in Texas in the week ending February 20 alone,\" the BuzzFeed report says. \"Our best estimate is that 702 people were killed by the storm that week. Even the lowest end of the range is almost three times the number officials have acknowledged. Neighboring states that were hit hard by the winter storm but did not experience the widespread power outages seen in Texas did not show a spike in deaths.\"\n\nThe victims included medically vulnerable people with chronic conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes and kidney problems, BuzzFeed said.\n\nThe February winter storm left thousands without power in subfreezing temperatures and caused serious damage to people's homes, leaving some apartment tenants with nowhere to go.\n\nIn Harris County alone, at least 66 people died from the storm. The county also felt the brunt of electricity and internet service outages, and the ability to obtain food or groceries, according to a report from the University of Houston Hobby School of Public Affairs."}

Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nAlex Khmelevskiy, the head of UX design at Clay — a design and branding agency based out of San Francisco — examined Citigroup's wire transfer and said the mistake could have been easily avoided with a more user friendly interface.\n\n\"The UI looks like it came from the early '90s, which is a problem on its own,\" Khmelevskiy told Insider.\n\nCitigroup Revlon payment on Flexcube Court filing\n\nA Citigroup spokesperson told Insider the company is working to update its loan operations platform.\n\n\"We take pride in the role that we play as a global leader in financial services and recognize that an operational error of this nature is unacceptable,\" the spokesperson told Insider. \"We have put significant, additional controls in place until the new system is operational.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the interface provider, Oracle, declined to comment.\n\nFederal judge Jesse Furman ruled last week that Citigroup will not be able to recoup half a billion dollars of its own money after it accidentally sent Revlon creditors nearly $1 billion.\n\nCitigroup made the costly mistake over the summer. Instead of transferring a $7.8 million interest payment to the cosmetic company's lenders, the bank transferred the full loan amount.\n\nThe bank notified the creditors within 24 hours that it had not intended to pay the full amount, which was not due until 2023. Some firms returned the money, but 10 others refused to return about $500 million of the funds, prompting Citigroup's failed lawsuit to recoup the payment.\n\nThe blunder was the result of the failure to check the right boxes for the wire transfer\n\nCitigroup — like many commercial banks — uses Flexcube, a third-party application system from Oracle designed to help perform tasks like wire transfers.\n\nCitigroup subcontractors are responsible for entering the transaction information into the Flexcube database in order to initiate the transfer process.\n\nOn Flexcube, the easiest way to perform a transaction is to enter the principal amount into the system. The principal amount is directed to a \"wash account\" within the bank, while the payment triggers the interest to be sent out automatically to lenders.\n\nFor the Revlon payment, the subcontractor in India checked the box labeled \"principal\" and entered the digits for an internal Citigroup wash account. Three people signed off on the transaction.\n\n\"Looks good, please proceed. Principal is going to wash,\" the supervisor wrote when he approved the transaction, according to the court filing.\n\nThe mistake was not realized till the next morning when the full amount was sent out to the 10 different creditors.\n\nIt turned out, the subcontractor needed to check two more boxes. In order to send the principal payment to the wash account, the subcontractor must also check the boxes for \"front\" and \"fund,\" setting them to the internal Citigroup account as well.\n\n\"Minor changes\" to Flexcube could have spared the bank from the blunder altogether\n\nKhmelevskiy's agency has worked with several large scale tech companies, including Facebook, Google, and Slack. He said there are many ways the platform could have been improved to avoid the $500 million mistake.\n\n\"Even if we put the look and feel aside, just adding more clear instructions for each field and using more human-friendly language and terms would improve it drastically,\" Khmelevskiy said. \"Even a minor change such as a confirmation dialog with an overview of what is about to happen could help Citi avoid making this mistake.\"\n\nIn his decision, the judge said he hoped other banks would learn from Citigroup's mistake and implement more steps to minimize the risk of errors — an accident which the judge calls the result of a \"fat finger.\"\n\nThe judge based his ruling off a previous case, stating that it was reasonable for the creditors to keep the funds because they matched what the lenders were owed.\n\n\"To believe that Citibank, one of the most sophisticated financial institutions in the world, had made a mistake that had never happened before, to the tune of nearly $1 billion — would have been borderline irrational\" Furman said in the ruling."}

They weren't step-parents. She had four parents who genuinely loved her as if she were their own, and this man is one of them.\"\n\nThe family is using an empty urn during the funeral service today in Blue Point, New York.

Adam Schiff, the committee chairman, in an interview on the Yahoo News \"Skullduggery\" podcast.\n\nSchiff added that, as the ranking Democrat on the intelligence panel in 2017, he was never briefed about the CIA's plans to target Assange. But he said the committee had reached out \"to the agencies\" — an apparent reference to the CIA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) — after reading about the Yahoo News account describing deep divisions within the Trump administration, including objections from White House lawyers, over the CIA's plans for unusually aggressive measures to cripple WikiLeaks that had been proposed by then agency Director Mike Pompeo.\n\nAsked if he had received any response to the committee's inquiry, Schiff replied: \"I can't comment on what we've heard back yet.\" (Spokespeople for the CIA and ODNI declined comment.)\n\nThe disclosure by Schiff that the committee is pursuing information about the CIA's measures targeting WikiLeaks comes the day after the ACLU and more than 20 other human rights and press freedom groups wrote to Attorney General Merrick Garland urging him to drop the criminal prosecution of Assange in light of what they called \"shocking\" reporting by Yahoo News \"on the government's conduct in this case.\"\n\nIt also comes on the eve of a critical hearing before a British appellate court in London next week over the U.S. Justice Department's appeal of a lower court judge's ruling rejecting its request to extradite Assange to the United States to face trial for publishing classified documents in violation of the World War I-era Espionage Act. The judge concluded that Assange, who is now in a British prison after spending years holed up in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, would be at serious risk of suicide if he were incarcerated in an American prison.\n\nBut lawyers for Assange intend to raise the issue of what they view as the CIA's misconduct, arguing that returning him to a country where some top officials once plotted to kidnap him strengthens the judge's conclusions about the risk of suicide and should be an additional basis for turning down the U.S. extradition request.\n\nThe Yahoo News story, published on Sept. 26, disclosed that Pompeo, who had publicly labeled WikiLeaks a \"non-state hostile intelligence service,\" pushed for highly aggressive measures to cripple the organization, including a so-called \"snatch operation\" that would abduct Assange from the Ecuadorean Embassy. There were also discussions within the CIA about the feasibility of assassinating Assange, including tasking for options on how to do so, although those talks never materialized into an actual plan."}

Whistleblower and former Facebook employee, Frances Haugen, 37, revealed her identity after she applied for federal whistleblower protection.\n\nHaugen had presented internal documents that went to Congress, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and The Wall Street Journal. She decided to reveal her identity and noted that Facebook realised that if they change the algorithm to be safer, people will spend less time on the site, and will click on fewer ads, making less money. \"I've seen a bunch of social networks and it was substantially worse at Facebook than what I had seen before. Facebook, over and over again, has shown it chooses profit over safety,\" Haugen told 60 Minutes.\n\nIt was Haugen who presented papers and information on Instagram being harmful for teenager's mental health that has led to the platform pausing Instagram Kids. Speaking about algorithms, Haugen told The Journal that in human interactions, people eventually move on from a topic, but algorithms don't, which is harmful for teenagers, \"And that's part of the danger for like teenagers, right? Part of the reason why these teen girls are getting eating disorders is they one time look up weight loss and the algorithms like, 'Oh great. We'll keep showing you more and more extreme weight loss things.'\" Haugen told the Journal, \"The thing I want everyone to know is that Facebook is far, far more dangerous than anyone knows, and it is getting worse. We can't expect it to fix itself on its own.\"\n\nShe noted that Facebook was taking internal actions that did not match its public statements. \"Facebook has publicized its work to combat misinformation and violent extremism relating to the 2020 election and insurrection. In reality, Facebook knew its algorithms and platforms promoted this type of harmful content, and it failed to deploy internally recommended or lasting countermeasures,\" she wrote in a cover letter to the SEC. The site allows divisive content because it promotes engagement, she told 60 minutes. \"Its own research is showing that content that is hateful, that is divisive, that is polarizing, it's easier to inspire people to anger than it is to other emotions,\" Haugen said.\n\nHaugen further noted that she had empathy for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. \"And Mark has never set out to make a hateful platform. But he has allowed choices to be made where the side effects of those choices are that hateful, polarizing content gets more distribution and more reach,\" she said.\n\nShortly after Haugen went live, Facebook and sister companies Instagram and WhatsApp underwent almost a 7-hour long outage. It took over six hours for Facebook to resolve the issue that the company claimed arose due to a \"faulty configuration change\". This was one of the longest outages Facebook and its services like WhatsApp faced."}

It was the deadliest day for the U.S. military since August 6, 2011, when insurgents shot down a transport helicopter, killing 30 Americans and eight Afghans.\n\nIn an interview on The Ana Rosa program, which was published on Monday, Bilal Karimi, spokesman for the Taliban military leadership, said: \"We can control terrorism, the attack at the Kabul airport was the fault of the United States, which made an appeal saying that they were going to take everyone out of Afghanistan.\"\n\n\"They had been outside the airport for many days, I am very sorry but it happened... The US evacuation plan has been very bad, all countries are calmer and there have been no more attacks,\" Karimi told the Spanish journalists.\n\nIn the interview, the spokesperson promised that the Taliban would not harm Spanish nationals that remain in the country.\n\n\"The Islamic State [Emirate] is not going to harm them, what we want is for those who have knowledge to work for the prosperity of their country, so that Afghanistan will rise up and be an advanced country.\"\n\n\"If someone wants to leave the country abroad, when the situation is more normalized, when the Kabul airport is already open, they can always leave with a passport and visa, do it legally and as in the rest of the world.\"\n\nKarimi added: \"They [foreign nationals] are all forgiven, we are not going to hurt, all of them can freely go out through their city, lead a normal life, they do not have to remain in hiding.\"\n\nDespite the Taliban's history of restricting rights of women, the military spokesperson attempted to assure the journalists: \"From the Islamic Emirate we say that it is a man or a woman, it does not matter. They have the same rights to study and advance, no problem. Women can work anywhere, also those who have positions in the government, normally.\"\n\nBut he said that the Taliban wanted women to comply with Islamic law, including in how they dress, so that they do not \"provoke a man.\"\n\n\"As long as they are well and remain in their hijab, they can work in electricity companies, offices, agricultural companies and with normality,\" he said.\n\nBut there has been much opposition to this policy, with groups of women across the country taking to the streets to protest against the Taliban's conservative laws. The militants fired weapons in Kabul on Saturday to break up a protest led by Afghan women demanding equality, just one day after the militant group said there will be \"no issue\" with women's rights."}

Millions of Californians received a second round of Golden State Stimulus checks (for $600 up to $1,100), and low-income Marylanders are eligible for direct payments of $300 or $500. Educators received bonuses in states like Florida, Michigan and Tennessee, and some front-line workers in Vermont also received checks.\n\nOn a national level, advance monthly child tax credit payments (up to $300 a month per child) are continuing to go out to millions of families through December, with the next coming Oct. 15.

During the pause, medical and scientific teams at the FDA and CDC examined available data to assess the risk of thrombosis involving the cerebral venous sinuses, or CVST (large blood vessels in the brain), and other sites in the body (including but not limited to the large blood vessels of the abdomen and the veins of the legs) along with thrombocytopenia, or low blood platelet counts. The teams at FDA and CDC also conducted extensive outreach to providers and clinicians to ensure they were made aware of the potential for these adverse events and could properly manage and recognize these events due to the unique treatment required for these blood clots and low platelets, also known as thrombosis-thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS).\n\nThe two agencies have determined the following:\n\nUse of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine should be resumed in the United States.\n\nThe FDA and CDC have confidence that this vaccine is safe and effective in preventing COVID-19.\n\nThe FDA has determined that the available data show that the vaccine's known and potential benefits outweigh its known and potential risks in individuals 18 years of age and older.\n\nAt this time, the available data suggest that the chance of TTS occurring is very low, but the FDA and CDC will remain vigilant in continuing to investigate this risk.\n\nHealth care providers administering the vaccine and vaccine recipients or caregivers should review the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers Administering Vaccine (Vaccination Providers) and Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers, which have been revised to include information about the risk of this syndrome, which has occurred in a very small number of people who have received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine.\n\nCDC's independent Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices met today to discuss the latest data on TTS, hearing from the vaccine manufacturer Janssen and the COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Technical (VaST) Subgroup, as well as a risk benefit analysis. ACIP is committed to be vigilant and responsive to additional information that could impact the risk benefit analysis of any of these vaccines. Vaccine safety monitoring will continue and any new information about TTS will be brought to ACIP as needed.\n\n\"Safety is our top priority. This pause was an example of our extensive safety monitoring working as they were designed to work—identifying even these small number of cases. We've lifted the pause based on the FDA and CDC's review of all available data and in consultation with medical experts and based on recommendations from the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. We have concluded that the known and potential benefits of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine outweigh its known and potential risks in individuals 18 years of age and older. We are confident that this vaccine continues to meet our standards for safety, effectiveness and quality. We recommend people with questions about which vaccine is right for them have those discussions with their health care provider,\" said Janet Woodcock, M.D., Acting FDA Commissioner.\n\n\"Above all else, health and safety are at the forefront of our decisions,\" said CDC Director Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky. \"Our vaccine safety systems are working. We identified exceptionally rare events – out of millions of doses of the Janssen COVID-19 administered – and we paused to examine them more carefully. As we always do, we will continue to watch all signals closely as more Americans are vaccinated. I continue to be encouraged by the growing body of real-world evidence that the authorized COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective, and they protect people from disease, hospitalization, and death. I urge anyone with questions about the COVID-19 vaccines to speak with their healthcare provider or local public health department.\"\n\nAssessment of Available Data\n\nMedical and scientific teams at the FDA and CDC reviewed several sources of information and data related to the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine to reach today's decision.\n\nSpecifically, the agencies assessed reports submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), reviewed the medical literature and considered the information from global regulatory partners about thrombosis with thrombocytopenia that have been reported following use of a similar, yet not identical, COVID-19 vaccine using a virus from the adenovirus family that has been modified to contain the gene for making a protein from SARS-CoV-2."}

Calhoun statue during a deadly riot in Washington, D.C.\n\nAndrew Hatley is the first South Carolinian known to be charged in connection to the riot of Jan. 6. Federal authorities contacted him by phone on Jan. 12, according to a federal complaint, and criminal charges were filed on Jan. 15.\n\nThe complaint charges Hatley with knowingly entering a restricted building without lawful authority, knowingly impeding government business, engaging in disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, and demonstrating or picketing in the Capitol buildings.\n\nHe was identified through witnesses, photographs and a cellphone tracking application, according to the federal complaint.\n\nThe complaint does not specify where Hatley is from in South Carolina or his age.\n\nAn attorney was not listed for Hatley in online court records by Tuesday. A working phone number or email for Hatley was not located in public records.\n\nThe federal complaint states that Hatley drove from his residence in South Carolina to Washington, D.C., on Jan. 5 to attend protests of the presidential election.\n\nA witness called the Federal Bureau of Investigation on the day of the Jan. 6 riot and said they had knowledge and photos of Hatley inside the Capitol, the complaint states.\n\nThe FBI's Columbia field office spokesperson, Agent Don Wood, said the local office did not have any \"substantial involvement\" in investigating Hatley.\n\nWood declined to comment on whether the office was pursuing any additional South Carolina residents for potential charges connected to the Capitol riot.\n\nFive people died in the Jan. 6 riot, including a Capitol police officer. Many were injured, and more than 200 have since been charged in connection to the chaos, according to national media reports and the FBI.\n\nThe breach of the Capitol building temporarily halted the certification of electoral votes by Congress to formally ratify Joe Biden as the winner of the presidential election. Biden is to be inaugurated on Jan. 20.\n\nHatley had used an application on his cellphone while in the Capitol to track his location, according to the complaint. The FBI obtained Hatley's phone number and verified Hatley's whereabouts on Jan. 6 through the \"Life360\" location-tracking app.\n\nA second witness gave several photographs to the FBI that the witness had obtained from Hatley, according to the complaint.\n\nOne of the photographs shows Hatley in a green respirator mask in front of a statue of John C. Calhoun, the politician from South Carolina who served as the nation's vice president under presidents John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson.

Andrew Cuomo, who has been accused of sexual harassment by three women.\n\nThe prime time host addressed the topic immediately at the start of his show, which airs at 9 p.m. Eastern, and just as quickly moved on.\n\nStories about the embattled governor's problems have been awkward for CNN, which allowed the two brothers to banter on the air several times last spring at the COVID-19 pandemic's start. The appearances charmed some viewers while making ethical experts queasy.\n\n\"Obviously, I'm aware of what's going on with my brother,\" Chris Cuomo said on Monday. \"Obviously, I cannot cover it because he is my brother. Now, of course CNN has to cover it. They have covered it extensively and they will continue to do so.\"\n\nHe said he cares \"profoundly\" about the issues brought up by the women who have accused his brother.\n\nBoth Andrew Cuomo, 63, and Chris, 50, are sons of the late New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, a Democrat who served three terms in the 1980s and 1990s. His son is in his third term as New York's leader.\n\n\"It's the least they can do,\" said Steven Thrasher, a journalism professor at Northwestern University. With the story hot, Thrasher said it would have been wise for Chris Cuomo to step back for a few days and let someone else do his show.\n\nSince he joined the network in 2013, CNN had prevented Chris Cuomo from doing stories about his brother for basic journalism reasons: a viewer could not expect someone to report objectively about a relative.\n\nBut, starting last March, CNN suspended its rule. Chris Cuomo had caught COVID-19 and was doing shows from his basement, quarantined from his family. New York had the most cases in the nation and the governor's briefings were a daytime TV hit. CNN figured putting the familial bonds and rivalries on the air would make for colorful TV.\n\nAfter a final appearance in late June, CNN reinstated the ban.\n\n\"The situation CNN finds itself in illustrates why journalists should not deviate or make exceptions, even well-intentioned ones, from fairly well-established principles of journalistic ethics,\" said Scott Stroud, ethics director for the Center for Media Engagement at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nTwo women who worked in state government for Cuomo — Lindsey Boylan and Charlotte Bennett — have separately accused Cuomo of making unwanted advances. Cuomo said he's sorry if anyone \"misinterpreted\" his behavior \"as an unwanted flirtation.\" New York's attorney general was empowered Monday to choose an independent investigator to look into the cases.\n\nThen, on Monday night, The New York Times reported that a third woman said she had been made uncomfortable by Cuomo's behavior at a wedding reception.\n\nThe harassment charges were piled on top of years of stories that Cuomo had bullied people, and questions about whether a state policy toward nursing homes last spring put people in danger of catching the virus.\n\nOne of the leading critics of the governor's nursing home policies, Fox News Channel meteorologist Janice Dean, saw the deaths of her father-in-law and mother-in-law in New York facilities last spring. She was unimpressed by Chris Cuomo's statement Monday.\n\n\"I will never forget these guys joking around while we screamed in horror at the thousands that were dying around us,\" Dean tweeted. \"An apology would have been a good start.\""}

Chan School of Public Health answers that question.\n\nThe research, which assessed the safety of the Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, is based on analysis of data from nearly 2 million individuals in Israel and represents one of the largest real-world assessments of COVID-19 vaccine safety to date.\n\nThe findings, the researchers said, affirm the overall safety of the vaccine and underscore that the risk of adverse consequences from actual infection with SARS-CoV-2 far outweighs potential vaccine risks.\n\nThe study involved two analyses: A comparison of adverse events between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, and between unvaccinated people infected with SARS-CoV-2 and unvaccinated noninfected people.\n\nThe study showed that few adverse events were associated with the vaccine. Myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle, the most serious of them, was rare, with a rate of 2.7 excess cases per 100,000 vaccinated people. This means that for every 100,000 individuals, 2.7 more cases of myocarditis occurred than would be expected, the researchers said.\n\nBy contrast, the risk of myocarditis was notably higher among infected but unvaccinated individuals, occurring at a rate of 11 excess cases per 100,000 people.\n\nCoronavirus infection—but not vaccination—was also associated with greatly increased risk of pericarditis (an inflammation of the area around the heart), heart arrhythmias, heart attacks, strokes, pulmonary embolism, deep-vein thrombosis, acute kidney damage, among others.\n\nVaccine hesitancy\n\n\"To date, one of the main drivers of vaccine hesitancy has been a lack of information regarding potential side effects of the vaccine,\" said study co-author Ben Reis, HMS assistant professor of pediatrics at Boston Children's Hospital and director of the predictive medicine group in the Computational Health Informatics Program at Boston Children's.\n\n\"This careful epidemiological study provides reliable information on vaccine safety, which we hope will be helpful to those who have not yet decided about vaccination,\" Reis said.\n\n\"Those who have hesitated until now to get vaccinated due to concerns about very rare side effects, such as myocarditis, should be aware that the risks for this very same side effect are actually higher among unvaccinated infected individuals,\" Reis said.\n\nThe results are based on records from Clalit Health Services in Israel, one of the world's largest integrated health record databases. The analysis is the largest peer-reviewed evaluation of the safety of a COVID-19 vaccine in a nationwide mass-vaccination setting.\n\n\"The extensive nationwide rollout of Israel's COVID-19 vaccination campaign provided the Clalit Research Institute with a unique opportunity to assess, through its rich and comprehensive digital datasets, the safety of the vaccine in a real-world setting, without needing to rely on individual-driven active reporting of side effects\" said study senior author Ran Balicer, director of the Clalit Research Institute and Chief Innovation Officer for Clalit.\n\n\"These results show convincingly that this mRNA vaccine is very safe and that the alternative of 'natural' morbidity caused by the coronavirus puts a person at significant, higher, and much more common risk of serious adverse events,\" Balicer said.\n\nThe results of this real-world study confirm, complement, and build on the previously reported findings of the Pfizer/BioNTech phase 3 randomized clinical trial, which involved 21,720 individuals, the researchers noted.\n\nThe comprehensive nature of this new analysis and the sheer volume of data involved offer a more detailed assessment of the vaccine's safety across a wider range of adverse events."}

The student's parents have been charged with involuntary manslaughter.\n\nA timeline of events released by district officials shows what happened preceding the tragedy.\n\nThe day before the shooting, a teacher reported seeing the student now charged in the shooting looking at bullets on his phone in class, according to a statement from Oxford Community Schools Superintendent Tim Throne. The student told a counselor and staff member that \"shooting sports are a family hobby.\"\n\nIn the morning before the shooting, the student was again sent to school counselors and his parents were called to campus after a teacher was alarmed by some of the student's drawings including one of a handgun with the words: \"The thoughts won't stop. Help me,\" reports the Associated Press. The student said the drawings were related to a video game he was designing.\n\n\"While both of his parents were present, counselors asked specific probing questions regarding the potential for self-harm or harm to others. His answers, which were affirmed by his parents during the interview, led counselors to again conclude he did not intend on committing either self-harm or harm to others,\" according to Throne.\n\nThe counselors said the parents must get their child counseling within 48 hours. The parents refused to take their son home from school and apparently went to work, Throne wrote. \"Given the fact that the child had no prior disciplinary infractions, the decision was made he would be returned to the classroom rather than sent home to an empty house.\" Counselors did not notify the principal or the assistant principal of the incidents, Throne's statement says.\n\nA few hours later, the shooting occurred during a passing period as hundreds of students transitioned between classes. Throne said actions taken then by students and staff saved lives and prevented the shooter from entering any classrooms. \"Before the shooter was able to walk a short distance to enter the main hallway, students and staff had already entered classrooms, locked doors, erected makeshift barricades and locked down or fled according to their training.\"\n\nThe school district is launching its own investigation by a third party. \"?It's critically important to the victims, our staff and our entire community that a full and transparent accounting be made,\" Throne wrote.\n\nLocal reaction\n\nAt the December meeting of the McGaugh Elementary School PTA, multiple parents brought up the shooting in Michigan with questions about safety protocols at their campus.\n\nMcGaugh Principal Dr. Issaic Gates told attendees at the online meeting that the safety of students and staff \"is the top priority on my mind every day.\" He said he would outline the school's safety protocols at a meeting being planned with the Seal Beach Police Department."}

In this conversation with SupplyChainBrain Editor-in-Chief Bob Bowman, Joe Klobus, claims and insurance manager with global freight forwarder OEC Group, discusses how the incident brought to light the concept of general average, a centuries-old law that requires shippers to share the losses from such an event.\n\nSCB: What is general average?\n\nKlobus: In short, it's the equitable sharing of a loss between the vessel owners and cargo interests. When the vessel encounters a peril that fits within the York Antwerp Rules, the vessel owners are able to declare general average, which would spread that loss across the cargo interests.\n\nSCB: In what kind of situations has this previously been invoked?\n\nKlobus: General average is often invoked for vessel fires or containers going overboard as a sacrifice. However, it's not commonly known that it doesn't apply to just that limited scope of events. It can also apply to salvage, to towing expenses, and for seeking refuge in a port or harbor. It's much broader than people typically know.\n\nSCB: So in a hypothetical situation where the carrier is found to be at fault, it couldn't invoke general average?\n\nKlobus: That's not true. If the carrier is at fault for a situation and it fits within the realm of the York Antwerp Rules, it can declare general average. And, generally speaking, the carriers aren't responsible when they do declare general average.

President George H.W. Bush made decisions as the commander in chief and delivered remarks from the White House to the American people on the war's opening night. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney advised the president on policy. Army Gen. Norman Schwartzkopf led the troops downrange. Serving as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, there was an Army Veteran advising Bush and Cheney while working with Schwartzkopf: Gen. Colin Powell.\n\nPowell was less than a year into his tour as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff when Operation Desert Shield started in August 1990. Soon after, he was a key player in a war that the now 83-year-old Veteran fondly recalls during his travels downrange to visit deployed service members.\n\n\"These youngsters were great,\" the retired general said. \"These youngsters were fabulous. These youngsters wanted to do their very, very best. These youngsters trained, like you wouldn't believe to get ready for this conflict.\"\n\n'We're a family'\n\nPowell said one of his fondest memories of Desert Storm Veterans was watching an Army sergeant talking to a reporter right before the war started. Powell said the reporter approached a tank crew and asked questions to get the soldier to admit fear.\n\n\"He said, 'Well, what do you think? Are you afraid? Are you ready?' And the young man answered, 'I'm ready. Sir, we're trained. We've been working hard and I'm ready. We're ready.' He said, 'I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid because I'm with my family. This is my family. We are a family. We will do this well. We will get it done.\"\n\nPowell said 30 years later that memory still is crystal clear.\n\n\"I'll never forget that expression of what he said,\" Powell said. \"His sergeants were smiling behind him. The other soldiers were smiling and that was the attitude that we went into this conflict: we're a family. And it was not just a family of tankers. It was a family of pilots. It was a family of everybody you can name.\"\n\nBefore the war ground war started, the Vietnam Veteran traveled to 2nd Brigade, 101st Airborne Division to speak to the soldiers. Powell commanded the brigade back in the 1970s.\n\n\"I went and talked to them,\" he said. \"It was a very moving moment for me.\"\n\nNot all moments were serious\n\nHe then went to another unit near the Saudi Arabia-Kuwait border. As he walked with troops, he saw camels nearby. He asked if the camels bothered the unit. The NCO he spoke to said the camels realized when a truck pulled up with orange mailbags, they were in for a treat.\n\n\"The camels noticed that about once every couple of days a truck would come in, and in the truck, a lot of baggage would be thrown out,\" Powell said. \"It didn't take them long to realize that when it's an orange bag, it's a mail bag. It didn't take them long to realize that when you have a mailbag and it's opened up, it has cookies because the GI's mother's sent them cookies.\"\n\nRoad to war through a fax\n\nPowell said Bush was cautious not to \"go to war just to go to war.\"\n\n\"President Bush went out of his way to see if he could not find a political solution and not just a conflict,\" Powell said.\n\nDespite serving as the senior uniformed military officer, Powell said he was reluctant to place U.S. military lives at stake unless necessary.\n\n\"I don't like war,\" he said. \"I hate war, but people thought that, you know, I was too reluctant to go to war. Well, I'll go to war when you want me to, but until we have to, let's see what we can do to solve the problem.\"\n\nHis policy to go to war as a last resort led to the media-labeled Powell Doctrine. The doctrine's principle idea is that, if there isn't a political solution, then the military should put its full weight behind the war to decisively win.\n\n\"That's what we did in Desert Storm,\" he said. \"We have to make sure that when we go to war, we go to war for the reason. We have to make sure that we've done everything we can to try not to have a war, but if one comes, fight it and fight it to the death. Fight it so they know America cannot be challenged in this way.\"\n\nWhen diplomatic efforts with Iraq failed, then it was time to send in the all-volunteer force. Because of the technology limitations, Desert Storm started over a fax machine.\n\n\"Back then, it wasn't quite the same,\" he said. \"The way General Schwarzkopf and I talked to each other quietly was with a fax machine. He had one and I had one. Our assistants had access to it and nobody else did.\"\n\nAir war softens the battlefield\n\nPowell said one of the major accomplishments of Desert Storm was sending in airpower opening night and for several weeks after."}

Just like the white dress, federal flowers from every state and territory were included and according to the press release, the repurposed navy garment also included the flower of the District of Columbia.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Hearst shared more details about the look on Instagram, adding that it was \"an honor\" to see Dr. Biden sporting her design.\n\n\"The Silk Wool dress ( and mask) was made entirely of existing fabrics. Made and embroidered in New York. It was originally used to fit the inauguration one. The First Lady requested to salvage for another occasion. Double repurposed. New is not always better..\"\n\nMeanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris' outfit also held special significance. Harris chose a cream-colored Prabal Gurung suit and satin camisole, which seemingly reflected Biden's note that Americans are \"choosing light over darkness.\"\n\nGurung, a Nepali immigrant and a favorite designer of former First Lady Michelle Obama, posted photos of the Vice President in his design on his Instagram Story, writing \"Yes to matriarchal power. Madame VP in PG.\"\n\n\"To see Madam Vice President continue to break barriers while wearing a Prabal Gurung ensemble to the Joint Session Congress at the United States Capitol in Washington, DC., fills me with the utmost joy and gratitude,\" the designer wrote on Instagram. \"A fellow child of immigrants and the first-ever female, Black and South Asian Vice President, her vision and tenacity inspire me—a Nepali American, Singaporean-born, Nepal and Indian-raised designer, daily.\"\n\nGurung continued, \"I am so honoured to be part of this historical moment and am humbled by the visibility and re-energised in my mission to advocate for representation and create better paths for the future.\"\n\nHarris also chose a Prabal Gurung look to wear on her first day in office. She donned a maroon wool crepe dress with a matching tailored coat for the Inaugural prayer service held on Jan. 21.\n\nBiden's speech, in which a president was flanked by two women on the dais for the first time, opened with him acknowledging the moment.\n\n\"Madam Speaker. Madam Vice President. No president has ever said those words from this podium. No president has ever said those words. And it's about time,\" he said.\n\nAppearing on MSNBC earlier Wednesday, Pelosi concurred: \"It's pretty exciting. And it's wonderful to make history. It's about time,\" said on Andrea Mitchell Reports. \"I made history when I was the first speaker to be standing behind President Bush. And he made note of that. Now this is just so exciting.\"\n\nAhead of Biden's speech — in which he outlined how he said his administration was getting \"America moving\" through the COVID-19 pandemic and other problems — Democratic women in Congress spoke to USA Today about what they called the importance of the women seated behind Biden.\n\nWhen inaugurated in January, Harris, 56, became the first woman vice president, as well as the first Black person and first person of Asian descent to hold the office."}

Shortly after the game, he won Super Bowl MVP No. 5. And during the trophy presentation, he appeared to make a sly move that one of his sponsors would love.\n\nAs he prepared to take a question on the podium, Lombardi Trophy in hand, Brady glanced down at his shirt, then pulled the collar tight around his neck – conveniently concealing the Nike logo on his undershirt.\n\nWhy is that notable? Brady is a prominent endorser of Under Armour, a Nike competitor.\n\nOn the field, Brady wears Under Armour cleats, and an Under Armour glove on his left hand. The NFL has an apparel and equipment contract with Nike. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers' uniforms, like those of every other team, are made by Nike. Their undershirts, and now their \"SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONS\" t-shirts, have Nike logos on them.\n\nBrady – likely aware how much brand visibility matters to sports apparel companies, especially on a stage as big as the Super Bowl's – perhaps realized that a quick shirt adjustment could make his appearance Nike-free.\n\nDid Brady pull a reverse Jordan?\n\nBrady isn't the first athlete to make a branding move on a celebratory podium. Team sponsorships and individual sponsorships often clash during postgame photo ops. The most famous example came at the 1992 Olympics.\n\nAt the time, Team USA was sponsored by Reebok. When the men's basketball team – popularly dubbed the \"Dream Team\" – won gold, Michael Jordan was forced to wear a Reebok warmup jacket onto a podium for the medal ceremony.\n\nJordan, a celebrated Nike endorser, found a workaround. The entire team half-unzipped their jackets to cover up the Reebok logo. Jordan, Charles Barkley and Magic Johnson draped American flags over their shoulders to be absolutely sure that the Reebok logo wouldn't be seen.\n\nIt's unclear how much thought Brady put into the shirt lift. It could have simply been a comfort move. But it very well could have been a sly nod to his Under Armour partnership.\n\nBrady's cover-up wasn't as successful as Jordan's\n\nIf it was a nod to Under Armour, though, Brady wasn't quite as clever or particular as Jordan. In other photos and videos from Brady's trophy lift, the Nike swoosh is clearly visible, front and center.\n\nTom Brady lifts the Lombardi Trophy after Super Bowl LV.

An autopsy is being conducted.\n\nBrian Laundrie remains missing. A search for Laundrie in the Carlton Reserve in Florida has been suspended.\n\nUWO student Miranda Baker took to TikTok to say she and her boyfriend picked up a hitchhiker at Grand Teton National Park on August 29.

So that was kind of weird. He then told us he's been camping for multiple days without his fiancée. He did say he had a fiancée, and that she was working on their social media page back at their van. In conversation, I brought up that we're going to Jackson. He freaked out. He's like 'nope, I need to get out right now, you know, pull over.' So we pulled over at the Jackson Dam.

Lilibet weighed 7 pounds, 11 ounces at birth, and both Meghan and Lilibet are \"healthy and well,\" after returning home from the hospital, according to a statement. The name pays homage to two of the most important women in Harry's life—\"Lilibet\" was a childhood nickname used by close family members for Harry's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, who had trouble pronouncing her own name as a child, while Lilibet's middle name, Diana, is a nod to Harry's beloved late mother, Princess Diana, who died tragically at age 36 in a 1997 car crash in Paris.

Rittenhouse has been charged with multiple counts, including reckless and intentional homicide, endangerment and being a minor in possession of a firearm.\n\nProsecutors allege Rittenhouse, who is white, left his home in Antioch, Illinois, and traveled to Kenosha to answer a call for militia to protect businesses. Kenosha was in the throes of several nights of chaotic street demonstrations after a white officer shot Blake in the back during a domestic disturbance, leaving Blake paralyzed.\n\nRittenhouse opened fire with an assault-style rifle during the protest, killing Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber and wounding Gaige Grosskreutz, authorities said. Rittenhouse has pleaded not guilty to all counts and argued he fired in self-defense. Conservatives have rallied around him, generating enough money to make his $2 million cash bail.\n\nAccording to online court records, a Wisconsin judge modified Rittenhouse's conditions of release on Friday to note Rittenhouse \"shall not knowingly have conduct with any person or group of persons known to harm, threaten, harass or menace others on the basis of their race, beliefs on the subject of religion, color, national origin, or gender.\"\n\nHe is also barred from possessing and consuming alcohol and from having firearms.\n\nProsecutors had requested the modifications after Rittenhouse was seen drinking at a bar in the southeastern Wisconsin city of Mount Pleasant, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Milwaukee, earlier this month. The legal drinking age is 21, but in Wisconsin, Rittenhouse could legally drink alcohol because he was with his mother.\n\nAccording to WMTV, prosecutors wrote in their request that Rittenhouse also posed for a photo outside Pudgy's Pub with two men as they made the \"OK\" sign with their hands, a symbol used by white supremacists. Prosecutors also alleged five men at the tavern serenaded Rittenhouse with a song that has become the anthem of the Proud Boys, a neo-fascist group."}

And we warn them that bullies never win in the end. Be the bigger person. Follow the right and righteous path, and you shall be rewarded.\n\nBut the examples being set on very public stages tell an entirely different story, one that says accumulating power is the goal, with no guardrails on how you acquire and keep it. Rules are for suckers, unless you're the one who makes them.\n\nTake voting rights. If the goal of our democracy is to let all eligible Americans vote and for every one of those votes to count, the Freedom to Vote Act would have had a clear glide path to passage. But when, as promised by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the compromise bill massaged by holdout West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin was brought to the floor Wednesday, not for a vote but for a mere discussion, Republicans offered no help.\n\nHow far Democrats will go to pass rules that creep toward restoring parts of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, obliterated by the Supreme Court, is uncertain. But for anyone interested in a true representative form of government in the United States, something is needed.\n\nPower play\n\nThat's not the view of Senate Republicans, led by Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who understands the ruthless power game without regard to the example it sets for the next generations. From Washington, his party sees advantage in election antics in states such as Texas, where GOP-heavy leadership is greedily grabbing the two House seats delivered by an increasing and increasingly diverse electorate with one hand, and gerrymandering away minority representation with the other.\n\nAfter protests, the Republicans who control the Texas Legislature and the redistricting process have restored to Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee's new district many of the Black Houston residents she currently represents. But every battle for every vote will be a tough one. Democratic Rep. Joaquin Castro, who represents the San Antonio area, said the new map was \"designed to discriminate, particularly against Latinos, who are the driving force behind the state's population growth.\"\n\nAs the census counts a U.S. population growing less white, it's an existential threat to those who see resources and representation as zero-sum. Unwilling to share leadership with people who were once locked out by law, states are changing the rules of democracy, and that is not a game.\n\nTexas is not the outlier, but the leader on this kind of obstinance, passing laws to loosen gun rules and unleash poll watchers on any voter deemed suspicious, turning them into the bullies (perhaps armed) that we warn our children about. It's no longer \"Love thy neighbors,\" but snitch on them for bounty if we think they're even thinking about getting an abortion. Those new laws won't, of course, end abortion for those with the means to travel to another state; it will just drive desperate girls and women to seek desperate solutions.\n\nTexas is just one place where you can find adults yelling at and sometimes threatening schoolteachers and administrators over what is not critical race theory (and I defy any of the objectors to come up with a coherent definition). It seems what they really fear are lessons that tell the truth about America, a country with lofty promises it has not always lived up to. If history includes racial truths that lead to understanding and progress, these folks want none of it."}

The legislature cancelled meetings next week, citing concerns about credible threats.\n\n\"We are prepared for the worst but we remain hopeful that those who choose to demonstrate at our Capitol do so peacefully,\" Michigan State Police Director Joe Gasper said during a news conference on Friday.\n\nIllinois Governor JB Pritzker said on Friday that while his state had not received any specific threats, he was beefing up security around the Capitol in Springfield, including adding about 250 state National Guard troops.\n\nThe alarm extended beyond legislatures, as well."}

He had initially retired from the league in March 2019, citing injuries, and signed with the WWE.\n\nIt turned out, he was \"not totally done\" with football, Gronkowski said last year.\n\nAround that time, Tampa Mayor Jane Castor dropped some news that the city's newest resident, Brady, was caught working out in a city park that was closed at the time due to COVID-19 regulations.\n\nShe wanted to make it clear that he was sighted, not cited.\n\nIt wasn't the only notable moment during Brady's early days as a Buc.

Those involved look back\n\nOne reason for the shock, horror and 24/7 media coverage of the Oct. 21 accidental shooting death on the set of \"Rust\" in New Mexico is that such on-set tragedies are rare: The last one was nearly 30 years ago, and the one before that was in 1984.\n\nYet some of the details in the 1993 shooting death of actor Brandon Lee on the set of \"The Crow\" in Wilmington, N.C., echo across the decades to Santa Fe, N.M., where \"Rust\" cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was killed and director Joel Souza was wounded by a gun fired by star and co-producer Alec Baldwin.\n\nThe guns in both cases were real and functional, but different makes. In both cases, the guns fired lead projectiles, unbeknownst to the actors and crew. In both cases, the guns were not properly checked before their use.\n\nRising star Lee, the son of actor Bruce Lee, was 28 at the time and about to get married. At 42, Hutchins, the mother of a young son, was an up-and-coming star in her field of cinematography.\n\n\"So unnecessary,\" lamented the former district attorney in Wilmington Jerry Spivey, who supervised the investigation of the Lee case.\n\nAnd so infrequent, say others involved in the case.\n\n\"In the course of those nearly 30 years, there have been thousands of movies involving gun play of one sort of another, and hundreds of thousands of shots fired, so really this is a very, very rare event,\" says James Janowitz, the New York lawyer who led the defense of the producers of \"The Crow\" in a subsequent civil lawsuit.\n\nOne difference between then and now: Baldwin is a bigger, more controversial star than the actor who fired the weapon that killed Lee, Michael Massee, then 41, a veteran character actor who died of stomach cancer at age 64 in 2016.\n\nThe gun Masse fired in a scene was supposed to contain blanks but unbeknownst to anyone, the gun's barrel contained a fragment of a lead bullet left over from an earlier scene.\n\n'Rust' shooting investigation: Halyna Hutchins' husband hires wrongful death attorney\n\nMassee was devastated by the tragedy, he said in a 2005 interview with \"Extra.\" He took a year off from acting and never saw \"The Crow,\" which resumed production after Lee's death and was released in May 1994 to good reviews and nearly $95 million at the global box office.\n\n\"I don't think you ever get over something like that,\" Massee said.\n\nAfter 1993, it wasn't supposed to happen again, says Spivey, in an interview with USA TODAY. After the investigation, he decided not to file criminal charges in the case.\n\n\"The hope was no person would ever again be killed on a movie set by a gun thought to be safe,\" he said. \"That's been the case until now. You have to go back to the hard and fast rule of no live ammunition on any movie set. Ever.\"\n\nAs Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza pointed out at a press conference Wednesday, Hollywood has had \"a record recently of being safe.\"\n\nBut the \"Rust\" set has been dogged by reports of a partial crew walkout over workplace complaints and safety issues, just hours before the accidental shooting."}

As a result of the hurricane, 96% of crude oil production and 94% of natural gas production in the U.S. federally administered areas of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) were shut in, according to estimates by the U.S. Department of Interior's Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. At least nine refineries shut down or reduced production. As a result, we reduced our forecast for crude oil production and refinery runs in our September Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO).\n\nWe revised down our estimate for U.S. crude oil production in the GOM in August by 0.2 million barrels per day (b/d) from the August STEO to 1.5 million b/d in the September STEO. We reduced our forecast of production in the GOM for September by 0.5 million b/d from the August STEO to 1.2 million b/d in the September STEO. We expect that disrupted GOM crude oil production will return through September, increasing to our previously forecast levels in October. Last year, the GOM accounted for 15% of U.S. crude oil production.\n\nAccording to our Weekly Petroleum Status Report, gross inputs into Gulf Coast refineries fell by 1.6 million b/d from the week ending August 27 to the week ending September 3. Although some refiners have resumed operations or begun the process for restarting, we expect refinery runs will average 713,000 b/d lower in September than they would have without the disruptions.\n\nRepairs to any infrastructure required to resume refinery operations, however, could potentially take longer, making the forecast highly uncertain. We forecast that average crude oil inputs into refineries later this year will be mostly unchanged from our previous August STEO forecast.\n\nFrom August 27 to September 3, our Weekly Petroleum Status Report data indicate crude oil inventories in the Gulf Coast fell by 2.6 million barrels and U.S. crude oil production fell by 1.5 million b/d. Over the same period, crude oil imports into the Gulf Coast fell by 247,000 b/d to 787,000 b/d. U.S. crude oil exports, which are mostly exported from the Gulf Coast, fell by 698,000 b/d over the same period."}

Interviews with nearly three dozen former and current Harris aides, administration officials, Democratic operatives, donors and outside advisers – who spoke extensively to CNN – reveal a complex reality inside the White House. Many in the vice president's circle fume that she's not being adequately prepared or positioned, and instead is being sidelined. The vice president herself has told several confidants she feels constrained in what she's able to do politically. And those around her remain wary of even hinting at future political ambitions, with Biden's team highly attuned to signs of disloyalty, particularly from the vice president.\n\nShe's a heartbeat away from the presidency now. She could be just a year away from launching a presidential campaign of her own, given doubts throughout the political world that Biden will actually go through with a reelection bid in 2024, something he's pledged to do publicly and privately. Or she'll be a critical validator in three years for a President trying to get the country to reelect him to serve until he's 86.\n\nFew of the insiders who spoke with CNN think she's being well-prepared for whichever role it will be. Harris is struggling with a rocky relationship with some parts of the White House, while long-time supporters feel abandoned and see no coherent public sense of what she's done or been trying to do as vice president. Being the first woman, and first woman of color, in national elected office is historic but has also come with outsized scrutiny and no forgiveness for even small errors, as she'll often point out.\n\nDefenders and people who care for Harris are getting frantic. When they're annoyed, some pass around a recent Onion story mocking her lack of more substantive work, one with the headline, \"White House Urges Kamala Harris To Sit At Computer All Day In Case Emails Come Through.\" When they're depressed, they bat down the Aaron Sorkin-style rumor that Biden might try to replace her by nominating her to a Supreme Court vacancy. That chatter has already reached top levels of the Biden orbit, according to one person who's heard it."}

Justices Clarence Thomas, Stephen G. Breyer and Samuel A. Alito Jr., the court's three oldest, were the no-shows. \"Several of the justices elected not to attend the inauguration ceremony in light of the public health risks posed by the COVID pandemic,\" Supreme Court spokeswoman Kathleen Arberg said in a statement.\n\nThe justices have not conducted business in person since March — holding private conferences and oral arguments via teleconference — although they gathered at a memorial service for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in September.\n\nChief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., for the fourth time, administered the oath of office to the president-elect. But he has yet to see a supporter on the other side of the Bible.\n\nPresident Barack Obama, whom Roberts swore in twice, voted against his confirmation to the Supreme Court in 2005. So did Biden. And President Donald Trump, to whom Roberts administered the oath in 2017, made clear during the campaign that he considered Roberts a \"disaster.\"\n\nThe relationship during that presidency was a rocky one, and the chief justice had the chore of presiding over Trump's impeachment trial in the Senate.\n\nBut the theme of Biden's inaugural address was putting differences aside, and the new president may have warmer thoughts these days for Roberts, who turns 66 next week. Roberts was the deciding vote to save Obamacare, the chief domestic accomplishment of the Obama-Biden administration.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, the first Latina on the Supreme Court, swore in Vice President Harris, the first woman to hold the job.

Gorsuch, Brett M. Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.\n\nThat presented more opportunities for awkwardness: They were seated behind Harris, who vigorously opposed all three. In particular, she conducted a heated grilling of Kavanaugh that thrilled liberals and deeply angered conservatives.\n\nAs a team, former senators Biden and Harris voted against six of the nine justices on the current court.\n\nThat might explain some of the no-shows.\n\nThomas, 72, and Alito, 70, are a different story.\n\nBiden attempted to filibuster Alito's nomination and said President George W. Bush's choice was too conservative to replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who at the time was the Supreme Court's pivotal justice.\n\nBiden has even more history with Thomas, who was confirmed when Biden was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Thomas's nomination was disrupted by allegations of sexual harassment leveled by Anita Hill, who previously had worked in government jobs with Thomas."}

The crisis surrounding his brother, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, has deepened amid another accusation of sexual harassment—the third account in a span of days, this time corroborated with a photo. As such, Chris Cuomo felt the need to address the unfolding scandal on-air. \"Obviously I am aware of what is going on with my brother. And obviously I cannot cover it because he is my brother,\" the Cuomo Prime Time host said, noting that \"of course, CNN has to cover it,\" has done so \"extensively,\" and will maintain that pace as the situation develops—one pertaining to issues that Cuomo said he has \"always cared very deeply about.\" But, the host continued, \"there's a lot of news going on that matters also, so let's get after that.\"\n\nCuomo recusing himself from covering sexual harassment allegations against his brother is technically the responsible thing to do, given his obvious conflict of interest. But the statement came after Cuomo had covered his brother for months starting in the early days of New York's battle with COVID-19, and without a shred of purported objectivity. Last spring, viewers were drawn to the act that was the Cuomo brothers, boosting New York's governor to celebrity status for his relatively sane handling of the pandemic. The pairing was such a conflict of interest that, as the New York Times' Ben Smith previously reported, it required CNN to roll back a rule they'd instituted in late 2013 when an interview between the Cuomos raised similar questions about ethics. At the time, the network told the host he could no longer interview his brother on television.\n\nWhile the reversal was a questionable decision—and one CNN quickly came under fire for—allowing the brothers their recurring shtick, complete with familial banter and praise for the governor's leadership, packed an emotional punch that some, including Chris Cuomo himself, argued audiences craved in the early days of the pandemic. \"I wanted people to see that he's not just super-intense on this all the time—that he's living it with you,\" the host said on his SiriusXM radio show at the end of March, noting his brother is \"not a general\" but \"a man in full\" while also acknowledging \"there will come a time when there's an accountability measure where it will no longer make sense for it to be me\" interviewing him."}

Use this calculator\n\nCNN — A third round of stimulus payments is expected to be on the way later this month.\n\nThe payments are included in a sweeping $1.9 trillion Covid relief package and are worth up to $1,400 per person, including dependents. So a couple with two children could receive up to $5,600. Unlike prior rounds, families will now receive the additional money for adult dependents over the age of 17.\n\nRoughly 90% of American households will be eligible, according to an estimate from the Penn Wharton Budget Model. Individuals who earn at least $80,000 a year of adjusted gross income, heads of households who earn at least $120,000 and married couples who earn at least $160,000 will be completely cut off from the third round of stimulus payments – regardless of how many children they have.\n\nHere's what else you need to know:\n\nOn what year are the income limits based?\n\nThe income thresholds will be based on a taxpayer's most recent return. If they've already filed a 2020 return by the time the payment is sent, the IRS will base eligibility on their 2020 adjusted gross income. If not, it will be based on the 2019 return or the information submitted through an online portal set up last year for people who don't usually file tax returns.\n\nWhen can you expect the money?\n\nPeople could start seeing the payments hit their bank accounts within days of President Joe Biden signing the bill.\n\nFor the previous pandemic stimulus bill, the IRS started sending out the second round of payments three days after then-President Donald Trump signed that legislation in late December. But it's possible that tax filing season, which is underway, could slow down the process this time.\n\nYou got the last stimulus check. Will you get this one?\n\nThe payments do not all go out at once. Those whose bank information is on file with the IRS would likely get the money first, because it would be directly deposited into their accounts. Others may receive paper checks or prepaid debit cards in the mail.\n\nNot necessarily. While the same people who received the full amounts in the previous two rounds of stimulus payments will likely get the full amount this time, the checks will phase out faster now – cutting off people at a lower income level.\n\nThe first round, which was worth up to $1,200, excluded individuals who earned at least $99,000, head of household filers with one child who earned more than $136,500 and married couples without children earning more than $198,000 – but families earning a little more were still eligible if they had children. About 160 million payments were delivered, with 94% of families receiving the money.\n\nThe second round, which was worth up to $600, also phased out a little faster because the full amount was smaller. It phased out entirely at $87,000 for single filers without children and $174,000 for those married filing jointly without children. Again, those earning a little more were still eligible if they had children. About 158 million payments went out, with 92% of families receiving them.\n\nThe payments have been based on a taxpayer's most recent tax return. So those who have filed new returns since last March could fall into or out of eligibility if their incomes changed.\n\nWho else isn't eligible?\n\nUndocumented immigrants who don't have Social Security numbers remain ineligible for the payments. But their spouses and children are eligible as long as they have Social Security numbers. They were excluded from the first round.\n\nWill you owe back some money to the IRS if you earned more in 2020?\n\nNo. If your 2019 income was less than your pay in 2020 you will not owe back any money.\n\nBut if your income fell in 2020, filing your tax return now – before the payments go out – may mean you'll get a bigger check."}

But a year before, Tropical Storm Irene flooded parts of New Jersey and claimed the lives of at least 10 people, according to news reports.\n\nWith Ida, intense rain and tornadoes wreaked a new level of havoc.\n\nNo storm in recent history claimed as many lives as Ida, Sandy or Irene, seeming to bolster the message of Murphy and other elected Democrats that climate change is taking a more frequent and extreme toll on humanity.\n\n\"This is just yet another reminder these things are coming more frequently, they're more intense — sadly, more deadly,\" Murphy said on \"Good Morning America\" Thursday.\n\nNew Jersey's location, surrounded by water on both sides, and its dense population makes it particularly susceptible to destruction. But the three recent storms — all within the last decade — seem to underline Murphy's point.\n\nThe governor declined on Thursday to provide details about the deaths from Ida, but he and other public officials spent the day making the case for enhancing the country's infrastructure to try and limit the damage from future storms.\n\nThe frequency and intensity of storms may have played a role in Ida, Murphy said. Many areas were still saturated from Tropical Storm Henri less than two weeks ago, he said, leading to severe flooding."}

She is more than we could have ever imagined, and we remain grateful for the love and prayers we've felt from across the globe. Thank you for your continued kindness and support during this very special time for our family,\" they said.\n\nBut back to Lilibet's christening. When will Lilibet's christening be? Who will be there? And will she be christened at Windsor like her older brother, Archie? Read on ahead for what we know about Lilibet's christening amid Harry and Meghan's continued drama with the British royal family.\n\nWhere is Lilibet's christening?\n\nLilibet's older brother, Archie, was christened at a private chapel at Windsor Castle in July 2019. However, it looks like Lilibet's christening may not take place at the same location. NBC royals correspondent Neil Sean reported in October 2021 that Harry and Meghan wanted Lilibet's christening to be at St. George's Chapel at Windsor (the same venue for their 2018 wedding), so the Queen could attend the ceremony.\"One of the bigger problems that Meghan really encountered of later is that she wanted her daughter, Lilibet Diana, to be christened in the place she was married alongside her husband Prince Harry. And then the christening of her firstborn, Archie,\" Sean said via Express. \"But that came to a grinding halt. Both Harry and Meghan were very keen to make that return and make sure that christening happened, particularly in front of Her Majesty The Queen.\"\n\nAccording to Sean, Harry and Meghan's request was denied by Harry's older brother, Prince William, who told them that Lilibet's christening at Windsor wasn't \"going to work.\" \"But moving forward there was one person who basically decided there wasn't an appetite for this and the person that seemingly is, so far, not willing to kiss and make up with his younger brother,\" Sean said. \"According to a very good source, Prince William was the one who basically said 'no, we don't think this is going to work,' it wasn't a particularly good idea.\""}

In some cases, we receive a commission from our partners; however, our opinions are our own.\n\nI've been answering questions about stimulus checks on Twitter, including whether former dependents are eligible.\n\nIf you meet the qualifications, you can get the stimulus money after filing your 2020 tax return.\n\nThis applies to both rounds of payments, totaling a maximum of $1,800 per person.\n\nQuestion: I was claimed as a dependent in 2019, but I'm filing my own tax return for 2020 — can I get a stimulus check?\n\nAnswer: Yes, as long as you meet the income requirements and have a Social Security number.\n\nAdult dependents — including college students and retirees — were left out of the stimulus check legislation passed in March and December of 2020, but there's a way to settle the score on your 2020 tax return. (The third stimulus check goes to individuals with qualifying dependents of any age.)\n\nDuring the initial disbursal of checks, no person over age 16 who was claimed as a dependent on another person's tax return could get a payment.\n\nBecause Congress directed the Treasury Department to use Americans' 2019 or 2018 tax return (whichever was most recently filed) to determine eligibility, it didn't entirely account for financial need in 2020, when the coronavirus gripped the US.\n\nHere's what I mean: Consider a 23-year-old who was claimed as a dependent on their parents' tax return in 2019. They graduated college in early 2020, but struggled to hold a job during the pandemic and could have used the relief check. Since the most recent return filed with the IRS listed the student as a 22-year-old dependent, their parents received no child stimulus payment (the dependent needed to be 16 or younger) and the student received no payment of their own.\n\nI'm certain there are many versions of this scenario, but all you need to know is this: If a parent, guardian, or relative is not going to claim you as a dependent for 2020 — and legally cannot — then you can collect any missing stimulus money when you file your own tax return. You won't get the money immediately, but it'll be added to your refund. The IRS delivers most refunds within three weeks.\n\nWhen does a student qualify as a dependent? They are under age 24 and enrolled full-time in college (at least five months) on the last day of the year OR they're under age 19\n\nAND they provided less than 50% of their own financial support during the year (scholarships are not considered student-provided support)\n\nHow to claim a stimulus check on your 2020 taxes\n\nA stimulus check is technically a refundable tax credit called the Recovery Rebate Credit. Both rounds of stimulus payments are combined into one credit. The third stimulus check is treated separately.\n\nA tax credit is a dollar-for-dollar reduction of your tax bill. A $1,000 credit, for example, cuts your tax bill by $1,000. Some tax credits are refundable, meaning if you don't have a tax bill large enough to use the full credit, you get the money as a refund. That's how the recovery rebate credit works. But in order to get the credit, you have to file a federal tax return, even if your income is too low to be taxable.\n\nQualifications for a 1st or 2nd stimulus check: You have a Social Security number, or you have a Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) and are married to a person with a Social Security number.\n\nYou meet the income limits.\n\nYou are not claimed as a dependent on another tax return for 2020.\n\nYou file a tax return for 2020 and claim the Recovery Rebate Credit."}

The Berlin-based project went public with the conflict in a post published Friday morning, citing the platform's recent ban of the NYU Ad Observatory.\n\n\"There are probably more cases of bullying that we do not know about,\" the post reads. \"We hope that by coming forward, more organizations will speak up about their experiences.\"\n\n\"the company cannot be trusted\"\n\nLaunched in March 2020, AlgorithmWatch provided a browser plug-in that would allow users to collect data from their Instagram feeds, providing insight into how the platform prioritizes pictures and videos. The project published findings regularly, showing that the algorithm encouraged photos that showed bare skin and that photos showing faces are ranked higher than screenshots of text. Facebook disputed the methodology but did not otherwise take action against AlgorithmWatch for the first year of the project.\n\nIn May, researchers say Facebook asked to meet with the project leaders and accused them of violating the platform's terms of service. Another objection was that the project violated the GDPR, since it collected data from users who had not consented to participate.\n\n\"We only collected data related to content that Facebook displayed to the volunteers who installed the add-on,\" the researchers say in their defense. \"In other words, users of the plug-in where only accessing their own feed, and sharing it with us for research purposes.\"\n\nStill, the researchers ultimately chose to shut down the project, believing they would face legal action from the company if it continued.\n\nReached for comment, a Facebook representative confirmed the meeting, but denied threatening to sue the project, saying the company was open to find privacy-preserving ways to continue the research.\n\n\"We had concerns with their practices, which is why we contacted them multiple times so they could come into compliance with our terms and continue their research, as we routinely do with other research groups when we identify similar concerns,\" the representative said. \"We intend to keep working with independent researchers, but in ways that don't put people's data or privacy at risk.\"\n\nThe social nature of the Facebook platforms makes it difficult to isolate any single user: even when a user opts in, their feed is necessarily made out of other people's content, who likely have not consented to participate in the research. Facebook has been particularly sensitive about research projects since the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which saw academic research data ultimately used for commercial and political manipulation.\n\nStill, the broader pattern is a troubling one. The algorithms that manage news feeds on Facebook and Instagram are immensely powerful but poorly understood, and Facebook's policies make it difficult to study them objectively. The NYU Ad Observatory, which tracked political advertising on the platform, saw its researchers banned earlier this month amid accusations of data scraping. In November, the company made similar legal threats against a browser called Friendly, which let users reorder their feeds chronologically. CrowdTangle, another popular tool for Facebook research, was acquired by the company in 2016."}

Meyn says this line of questioning was one of the few times the prosecution made up some ground, but it took too long to get to those questions and by then Binger may have lost the attention of the jury.\n\n\"I didn't understand where the prosecutor was going with his cross,\" Meyn, who has worked for the Wisconsin State Public Defender and the Wisconsin Innocence Project, says. \"There should be no guessing. The general rule in cross-examination is, either you know the answer or don't care what the answer is. I felt that rule was not being followed. There was always one question too many, even if the prosecution sort of made a point, he asked that one additional question to further explain what he meant. By the time they got to what I thought was their most effective cross-examination of the day, it was the very end of the day. By that time you might have lost half the jury. To lose half the jury during a cross-examination of the defendant himself is a problem.\"\n\nBinger started his cross-examination by asking about events much earlier in the night and occasionally took tangents into topics such as Rittenhouse's video game preferences or the fact that he ignored the citywide curfew in Kenosha that night.\n\n\"If that's what you're basing your murder charge on, then you have big problems,\" Meyn said. \"I don't know what that was supposed to accomplish except sympathy for the defendant. The optics for the prosecution would be terrible, the last thing they want to emphasize is that it's a kid.\"\n\n\"They started with the curfew, oh my gosh,\" he adds. \"You have a murder case and you're talking about a curfew violation first? Who cares if someone's not supposed to be there, what does it have to do with intentional homicide?\"\n\nInstead of focusing on video games or curfew violations, Meyn says he would have focused more on why Rittenhouse thought his life was threatened and how he could claim that he himself wasn't a threat to Joseph Rosenbaum, Anthony Huber and Gaige Grosskreutz, his victims.\n\n\"I would have gone through each of these things, these people aren't related, aren't together, aren't in a gang, none of them know each other,\" Meyn says, \"That should be the emphasis of the cross. You shot three people in three minutes. You describe a mob, no one here knew each other. These incidents had space between them. And then the first two didn't have a weapon.\"\n\n\"How strong does that get after he shoots someone, after he's running down the street with an AR-15?\" he continues. \"That is a threat. I would've focused on Grosskreutz, when you saw him with a gun he became a threat, yes? So it's OK that you — it's reasonable when you see someone with a gun [to view them as a threat] but not when he sees someone with a gun?\"\n\nThe decision over whether or not a defendant should testify is always a risky one for the defense, but according to Meyn it mostly paid off for Rittenhouse.\n\n\"Rittenhouse as a witness did phenomenal,\" he says. \"[He] maintained control of his narrative during the entirety of cross. Never waivered, regardless how many times he was asked to admit x, y or z. That's extraordinary.\""}

Providing this metric for COVID-19 misinformation, the company said, is more complex.\n\n\"When it comes to COVID, though, things are evolving even more quickly so it does make prevalence even more difficult to define and measure,\" said Guy Rosen, Facebook's vice president of integrity, during a press conference on Wednesday.\n\nThe action came about a month after the White House singled out Facebook in saying that about a dozen people were responsible for creating 65% of the vaccine misinformation on social media platforms -- all of whom remained active on the social networking giant.\n\nDespite the action against \"disinformation dozen,\" the White House continued to criticize Facebook's response to misinformation.\n\n\"In the middle of a pandemic, being honest and transparent about the work that needs to be done to protect public health is absolutely vital, but Facebook still refuses to be straightforward about how much misinformation is circulating -- and being actively promoted -- on their platform,\" a White House spokesperson told CNN Business on Wednesday.\n\nFacebook didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the spokesperson's remarks.\n\nPoliticians, including US President Joe Biden, and advocacy groups have criticized social networks for failing to effectively combat the spread of COVID-19 and vaccine misinformation. Facebook partners with fact-checkers, directs people to authoritative information and labels misinformation. But researchers have questioned how effective those measures are in curbing the spread of false claims online.\n\n\"There will always be examples of things we missed and, with a scale of our enforcement, there will be examples of things that we take down by mistake,\" Rosen said. \"There is no perfect here.\"\n\nFacebook said it has more than 65 criteria for false claims about COVID-19 and vaccines that would prompt it to remove posts from its platforms. The company has added to this list, including false claims that COVID-19 vaccines cause Alzheimer's and that being around vaccinated people could cause secondary side effects to others.\n\nThe social network said it removed more 3,000 accounts, pages and groups for violating its rules against COVID-19 and vaccines. It has also displayed warnings on more than 190 million pieces of COVID-related content on Facebook that fact-checkers rated, and it displays these posts lower in people's News Feeds.\n\nFacebook, which partnered with Carnegie-Mellon University and the University of Maryland on a COVID-19 survey, said that vaccine hesitancy for people in the US on Facebook has declined by 50%. Vaccine acceptance increased by 35% in France, 25% in Indonesia and 20% in Nigeria, the social network said.\n\nThe company also shared new data including what domains, links, pages and posts were the most widely viewed in the US on Facebook between April and June. Facebook counts a view when content appears on the News Feed, so the metric differs from engagement. The social network owns data analytics tool CrowdTangle, but executives have reportedly raised concerns about data that shows high engagement with right-wing sites.\n\n\"The narrative that has emerged is quite simply wrong,\" Rosen said, noting that CrowdTangle includes data about interactions from a limited set of certain pages, groups and accounts."}

We can be net zero, and this is what we pledge to do.\"\n\nSo what does reaching net zero carbon emissions mean?\n\nAs explained by Archewell, carbon is emitted with almost every human action, from \"what we eat and how often we eat it\" to \"our reliance on big industries that contribute to the problem.\"\n\nHarry and Meghan are committing to make different, more thoughtful every day choices geared at whittling down their carbon footprint as much as possible over time — and, since some carbon emissions are inevitable, investing in carbon removal projects to account for the balance. (For more information, the Sussexes recommend this site.)\n\nFor a prominent couple like the Sussexes, frequent global travel will naturally be one piece of the puzzle. But for anyone, rethinking day-to-day transportation or even something as simple as flipping off light switches (as Prince Charles taught Prince William and Harry to do when they were young boys) can add up toward an overall positive environmental impact.\n\nAmong the partners who will be informing Harry, 37, and Meghan, 40, are the Duke's nonprofit organization Travalyst and the Ethic, the sustainable investing platform the couple recently partnered with \"to focus our investments in support of a low-carbon economy.\"\n\nThe Sussexes have been taking on a more vocal role for political and environmental advocacy since stepping back from royal duties in 2020, with Meghan recently penning an open letter to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to advocate for nationalized paid parental leave — a letter she said she wrote \"on behalf of my family, Archie and Lili and Harry.\"\n\nThe couple also appeared at the recent trip to New York, they met with local and international political leaders and spoke about vaccine equity at Global Citizen Live.\n\nOf course, an escalating push for environmental consciousness and innovative solution-seeking also aligns with recent moves by Harry's family.\n\nPrince William and wife Kate Middleton and Prince William are currently in Glasgow alongside Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, as the top royals make the rounds at COP26 to spur global leaders to action.\n\nWilliam in particular had a busy day on Tuesday, introducing the winners and finalists of his inaugural Earthshot Prize Awards to attendees at the summit.\n\n\"I hope our finalists have given you cause for optimism,\" he told the audience at an event on Tuesday afternoon. \"They represent a growing wave of innovators, dedicating their time and talent to finding solutions to repair our planet.

The TAG-VE was convened on 26 November 2021 to assess the SARS-CoV-2 variant: B.1.1.529.\n\nThe B.1.1.529 variant was first reported to WHO from South Africa on 24 November 2021. The epidemiological situation in South Africa has been characterized by three distinct peaks in reported cases, the latest of which was predominantly the Delta variant. In recent weeks, infections have increased steeply, coinciding with the detection of B.1.1.529 variant. The first known confirmed B.1.1.529 infection was from a specimen collected on 9 November 2021.\n\nThis variant has a large number of mutations, some of which are concerning. Preliminary evidence suggests an increased risk of reinfection with this variant, as compared to other VOCs. The number of cases of this variant appears to be increasing in almost all provinces in South Africa. Current SARS-CoV-2 PCR diagnostics continue to detect this variant. Several labs have indicated that for one widely used PCR test, one of the three target genes is not detected (called S gene dropout or S gene target failure) and this test can therefore be used as marker for this variant, pending sequencing confirmation. Using this approach, this variant has been detected at faster rates than previous surges in infection, suggesting that this variant may have a growth advantage.\n\nThere are a number of studies underway and the TAG-VE will continue to evaluate this variant. WHO will communicate new findings with Member States and to the public as needed.\n\nBased on the evidence presented indicative of a detrimental change in COVID-19 epidemiology, the TAG-VE has advised WHO that this variant should be designated as a VOC, and the WHO has designated B.1.1.529 as a VOC, named Omicron.\n\nAs such, countries are asked to do the following:\n\nenhance surveillance and sequencing efforts to better understand circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants.\n\nsubmit complete genome sequences and associated metadata to a publicly available database, such as GISAID.\n\nreport initial cases/clusters associated with VOC infection to WHO through the IHR mechanism.\n\nwhere capacity exists and in coordination with the international community, perform field investigations and laboratory assessments to improve understanding of the potential impacts of the VOC on COVID-19 epidemiology, severity, effectiveness of public health and social measures, diagnostic methods, immune responses, antibody neutralization, or other relevant characteristics.\n\nIndividuals are reminded to take measures to reduce their risk of COVID-19, including proven public health and social measures such as wearing well-fitting masks, hand hygiene, physical distancing, improving ventilation of indoor spaces, avoiding crowded spaces, and getting vaccinated.\n\nFor reference, WHO has working definitions for SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Interest (VOI) and Variant of Concern (VOC).\n\nA SARS-CoV-2 VOI is a SARS-CoV-2 variant:\n\nwith genetic changes that are predicted or known to affect virus characteristics such as transmissibility, disease severity, immune escape, diagnostic or therapeutic escape; AND\n\nthat has been identified as causing significant community transmission or multiple COVID-19 clusters, in multiple countries with increasing relative prevalence alongside increasing number of cases over time, or other apparent epidemiological impacts to suggest an emerging risk to global public health.\n\nA SARS-CoV-2 VOC is a SARS-CoV-2 variant that meets the definition of a VOI (see above) and, through a comparative assessment, has been demonstrated to be associated with one or more of the following changes at a degree of global public health significance:"}

The latest stimulus package, the American Rescue Plan, includes up to a $1,400 stimulus check for eligible individuals, $2,800 for married or joint filers, and $1,400 for dependents. If you didn't get a third stimulus check, here's why. If there is a fourth stimulus check, however, it could look different than the previous three stimulus checks. There are many ways for Congress to give people more money from Washington. Here are some options:\n\n1. Send $2,000 stimulus check every month\n\nMore than 75 members of Congress want to give you $2,000 stimulus checks every month until the Covid-19 pandemic is over. Under this proposal, you could get a recurring stimulus check every month until the economy recovers. The rationale is that a one-time stimulus check is insufficient for most Americans who are struggling financially as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. In January, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and 55 Democrats sent a letter to President Joe Biden urging him to support further stimulus checks. However, Biden doesn't support recurring stimulus checks nor are there enough votes in Congress to pass $2,000 a month stimulus checks. There are many reasons why a 4th stimulus check is unlikely. For example, Biden is focused on passing his new infrastructure package, and that stimulus package doesn't include any one-time or recurring stimulus checks. However, Congress could add a stimulus check before passing the legislation, although the likelihood is low.\n\n2. Make the child tax credit permanent\n\nBiden proposed giving $300 checks every month for people with children. This equates to up to a $3,600 cash allowance for children under age 6. There's also up to a $3,000 cash allowance for children ages 6 to 17, which equates to a $250 check every month. This change, which is included in the last stimulus package, changes the prior child tax credit of up to $2,000 annually. However, the $300 checks every month are only temporary. Rather than provide monthly or recurring Economic Impact Payments, Congress could make the temporary child tax credit permanent. Biden supports extending these recurring checks, while other members of Congress want the child tax credit to become permanent.\n\n3. Give parents $1,000 checks every month\n\nSen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) proposed new legislation this week that would create the Parent Tax Credit, a tax cut up to $12,000 per year, which is intended to help working parents start a family and raise children. Hawley's plan would enable parents to care for their children at home, rather than hire a commercial childcare provider, and still qualify for the tax cut. Congress could pass this legislation instead of stimulus checks. To qualify, you need at least one child under age 13 and you must work at least 20 hours per week and earn at least the minimum wage. There would be no income phase out. If Congress passes this legislation, this tax cut would be in addition to the child tax credit.\n\n4. Congress could extend unemployment insurance\n\nSupplemental federal unemployment benefits are scheduled to expire in September. Currently, per the latest stimulus package, you can get $300 a week of supplemental federal unemployment insurance. Congress could extend this temporary benefit and help provide additional, direct stimulus to millions of unemployed Americans. If Congress extends supplemental unemployment insurance, this benefit would act as a recurring stimulus check for a targeted group of individuals.\n\n5. Enact student loan cancellation by executive order"}

It was almost like I was talking to two familiar people that I've known for quite some time.\"\n\nOnce inside, they sampled \"a lot of my favorite things on the menu,\" says Wilson, who opened the soul food eatery in 2005. The pair had their pick of Southern staples, including catfish and collard greens, as well as contemporary twists on old classics like eggnog waffles and spring rolls with black eyed peas.\n\nBut lunch wasn't necessarily the main priority for Meghan, 40, and Harry, 37. The couple specifically requested that Wilson not close the restaurant for a private visit because \"they wanted to be with the people, and that to me was so endearing,\" says Wilson.\n\n\"They took time to engage with other customers who were shocked that they were there ... [they talked] with our service staff, with our chef,\" she adds.\n\n\"What surprised me was how down-to-earth, how comforting, how caring they really are. And it's not what I expected from a royal,\" she says. \"They really are amongst the nicest people I've ever met.\"\n\nBeyond the face time, Harry and Meghan also made sure to pay it forward, leaving a $25,000 donation to Melba's COVID-19 Employee Relief Fund via their Archewell Foundation.\n\nWilson says the money will make a difference amid \"a very challenging time, especially for the food and beverage industry. It's about really providing our employees and other restaurant workers, as well as people that are going through food insecurity during this time of COVID-19 ... with opportunity, making sure that our employees can pay their rent, can pay their bills and also that they have substantial meals.\"\n\nThis work is deeply personal to Wilson, who tells PEOPLE, \"I started out with very, very humble beginnings, and my life is totally about service, whether it's City Harvest or for my Harlem community, my life is fulfilled by giving.\"\n\nShe continues, \"For [the Duke and Duchess] to have heard about us via word of mouth and chose to come there to support a Black, female-owned business is definitely big. But it also shows that people that come from humble beginnings and in urban communities, or any small community, that people see us, they hear what we do, and we're recognized in that way. So it was so much bigger than Melba's, it's about Harlem. It's also about people who have dreams and have vision.\""}

What's notable here is that Facebook and Twitch are essentially customers of their own cloud platforms. When you consider how much complexity the cloud providers have pushed to their customers, these incidents keep happening — not because people are bad at cloud security but because it's really hard to get good at it. Let's explore that.\n\nWhy Cloud Risk Is Configuration Risk\n\nThe cloud attack surface is configuration, not the network. Configuration is essentially how you've designed and built your infrastructure. The word \"configuration\" can feel like a small detail, but in the cloud, configuration is a big deal. A mistake here can create vulnerabilities and break applications. A single misconfiguration can have a huge blast radius in terms of system downtime or a data breach — and the resulting loss of revenue and customer trust.\n\nTake a car, for example. A car has an engine, a transmission, wheels, etc. All of these components have configurations, some of which are related to safety and regulated by law. People and machines inspected the configurations of the car before it rolled off the line, which the owner may have changed over time. A safety inspector flags configuration violations because bad configuration can cause a breakdown or an accident."}

The bell, situated atop a square tube extending aboveground from an opening at the coffin's head, was connected to a rope that dangled down the tube into the coffin. The ladder similarly extended down the tube. If the corpse chose to rejoin the living, it could climb up the ladder. Should that prove too much of a strain, it could instead ring the bell to halloo for assistance.\n\nGo ahead and laugh at Vester's contraption (inspired perhaps by publication of Edgar Allen Poe's 1844 story, \"The Premature Burial\"). But something very much like it has been erected over the past half-century by government at the state and federal levels in the United States. The chief difference is that instead of helping to resurrect the deceased's body, these ingenious new inventions help to resurrect the deceased's money, granting it virtual and in some cases literal immortality. Never in our lifetimes has it been such an attractive prospect to be fabulously rich and dead.\n\nNever in our lifetimes has it been such an attractive prospect to be fabulously rich and dead.\n\nThe changes in recent decades to government policies affecting inheritance herald a massive, largely unremarked redistribution of wealth in America—one that President Joe Biden tried to slow this past spring, only to have his proposed reform rejected by his fellow Democrats. (More on that below.) It's widely understood that the wealthiest one percent saw its share of the nation's wealth increase from 30 percent in 1989 to 39 percent in 2016. That was driven by the trend in rising income inequality starting in the late 1970s. But as today's millennials, Generation Z, and Generation Alpha (that's babies born since 2010) enter middle age, there's a decent chance wealth inequality will be driven less by unequal income than by unequal inheritance. That's because we're about to witness the largest transfer of wealth that the United States has ever known."}

The store was fully stocked, and more importantly, had functioning lights and heat. The fifty-year-old graphic designer found the same at the Food King store he visited afterward. Besides having to step over residual snow sludge on streets and sidewalks, El Pasoans like Gomez were experiencing few aftereffects of a historic winter storm that brought the city subfreezing temperatures and three inches of snow and ice.\n\nScrolling through Twitter that same day, Gomez found himself wishing he could do something to help when he saw pictures and videos of what so many fellow Texans were experiencing—bursting pipes, falling ceilings, flooding, and freezing homes. \"TEXAS! Head west, far west,\" he tweeted. \"Our grid is up in El Paso, and we welcome anyone that needs a respite from this frigid chaos. Hotels, shelters, and hope.\"\n\nWhen the winter storms that paralyzed most of Texas first blew through El Paso on February 14, only about 3,000 people in the city had a power outage in their homes, and more than 2,000 of those saw their power restored within just five minutes. No homes in this city of 682,000 residents spent days without power or heat—an experience common to millions throughout the rest of the state. Although this winter storm didn't hit El Paso as severely as it did other parts of the state, the conditions were similar to those during a February 2011 storm that devastated the city. It's thanks to the preparations that El Paso made in response to that disaster, as well as its operating on a different electric grid than the majority of Texas, that the city had a starkly different experience during the last awful week for the state.\n\nBecause of the vast distance that separates El Paso from Texas's other major population centers, and because its customer base includes parts of southern New Mexico, the power supply of the city's public utility isn't linked to the grid overseen by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which manages about 90 percent of the state's electric load. Instead, it's connected to the Western Interconnection grid, which spans fourteen states in the West, along with parts of Canada and Mexico. As a consequence, when the winter freeze hit Texas, El Paso Electric had a sizable safety net. In addition to its local plants, it drew on Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station in Arizona to meet the surge in customer demand as people cranked up their thermostats.\n\nMeanwhile, ERCOT's grid purposefully remains within the state's boundaries in order to avoid federal energy regulations. When power it was counting on from wind, nuclear, and natural gas sources was adversely affected by the wintry conditions, ERCOT couldn't fall back on help from neighboring states. \"There's been a tremendous amount of supply disruptions,\" said Steve Buraczyk, El Paso Electric's senior vice president of operations. \"It's difficult for them to try to deal with that just within ERCOT.\"\n\nThe other big difference for El Paso Electric is that all of its power plants were outfitted for a deep freeze. After that February 2011 storm, hundreds of thousands of the utility's customers were left without power for extended periods. In the years since, it has spent millions to prepare for the next extreme winter event, including $4.5 million on adapting many of its existing facilities for prolonged operation in freezing temperatures. The winterization of a power plant is similar to preparing your house for winter, except much more expensive.

That drug has no proven effect against the virus. © The image is a screenshot of a video posted on President Bolsonaro's Facebook account\n\nA Brazilian Senate committee yesterday approved on a 1,100-page report that lays bare what happens when a country's president adopts policies with utter disregard for human rights during a pandemic.\n\nThe report was the result of months of hearings and investigation by the committee into the government's response to the Covid-19 pandemic. It portrays a president who turned his back on science and endangered the health and lives of Brazilians.\n\nCovid-19 has killed more than 600,000 Brazilians, but thousands of those deaths could have been avoided, evidence presented in the report indicates.\n\nPresident Jair Bolsonaro spread false information about Covid-19, opposed social distancing, refused to wear masks, and routinely shook hands with crowds of supporters. His ultimate goal, the report concluded, was rapid contagion so that Brazil would reach herd immunity.\n\nHe not only refused to follow World Health Organization recommendations to protect public health, but he sought to block Congress and local officials from following guidelines. For instance, in July 2020, he vetoed legal provisions to make mask wearing mandatory in churches and in Brazil's overcrowded prisons.\n\nAn episode in Amazonas state in January 2021 encapsulates the tragic consequences of those policies. In late 2020, local officials had warned the federal government of an impending shortage of oxygen, but instead of securing supply, the Bolsonaro administration sent drugs that have no proven effect against the virus, the report said. When the oxygen ran out, dozens of Covid-19 patients died.\n\nThe government sent the same unproven drugs to Indigenous people, the investigative committee found. It drafted a plan to protect them from Covid-19 only after repeated orders by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe report showed that the Bolsonaro administration did not respond to several offers of vaccines from the Butantan Institute – a research center owned by the São Paulo state government. The report also included testimony showing that Bolsonaro was presented with some evidence of corruption in one vaccine procurement contract. A witness said Bolsonaro committed to report the case to federal police, \"but that did not happen,\" the report said.\n\nThe report recommended a variety of criminal charges against Bolsonaro and other officials, as well as his impeachment. The attorney general, who was appointed by Bolsonaro and has been widely criticized for allegedly taking decisions favoring the president, should examine the strong evidence uncovered by the committee very seriously."}

The centerpiece of the law was an emergency payment to over 150 million American households that needed help.\n\nCongress used a simple filter to determine who was eligible for assistance: The full $1,200 was limited to single taxpayers who'd reported $75,000 a year or less in income on their previous tax return. Married couples got $2,400 if they had reported less than $150,000 in income. Money was sent automatically to those who qualified.\n\nIra Rennert, worth $3.7 billion according to Forbes, did not appear to need the cash infusion offered by the CARES Act. After all, his 62,000-square-foot Hamptons home is one of the largest in the country, so he was unlikely to get cabin fever during lockdown, let alone have trouble buying food. Nevertheless, Rennert, who made his fortune as a corporate raider in the '80s and '90s, got a $2,400 check from the government.\n\nGeorge Soros, the prominent hedge fund manager and philanthropist who's worth $8.6 billion, didn't need the CARES cash, either. Neither did his son, Robert, himself worth hundreds of millions. But they, too, both got checks. (Both returned the checks, according to their representatives.)\n\nProPublica, using its trove of IRS records, identified at least 18 billionaires who received stimulus payments, which were funded by U.S. taxpayers, in the spring of 2020. Hundreds of other ultrawealthy taxpayers also got checks.\n\nThe wealthy taxpayers who received the stimulus checks got them because they came in under the government's income threshold. In fact, they reported way less taxable income than that — even hundreds of millions less — after they used business write-offs to wipe out their gains.\n\nProPublica found 270 taxpayers who collectively disclosed $5.7 billion in income, according to their previous tax return, but who were able to deploy deductions at such a massive scale that they qualified for stimulus checks. All listed negative net incomes on tax returns.\n\nConsider two stimulus recipients with similarly huge incomes in 2018. Timothy Headington is an oil mogul, real estate developer and executive producer of such films as \"Argo\" and \"World War Z,\" and he's worth $1.4 billion. He had $62 million in income in 2018, but after $342 million in write-offs, his final result was negative $280 million. The same was true of Rennert, whose $64 million in income that year was erased by $355 million in deductions, for a final total of negative $291 million.\n\nFigures like these reveal a basic truth about the U.S. income tax system. Most people earn the overwhelming majority of their income via wages and take deductions where they can. But the income of the ultrawealthy as revealed on their taxes tells, at best, a partial story. As ProPublica reported earlier this year, the wealthiest taxpayers often have great flexibility in when and how they take taxable income, allowing them to pay a minuscule portion of their wealth growth in taxes. For the ultrawealthy, wages are to be avoided, carrying as they do the burden of not only income tax but also of payroll taxes.\n\nWages rarely made up a significant portion of income for the 270 wealthy stimulus check recipients identified by ProPublica. In total, only $82 million, or 1.4%, of the $5.7 billion in income taken in by the group came in the form of wages.\n\nThe ultrawealthy have other tax advantages. Many can tap a particularly generous vein of deductions: businesses they own. These can wipe out all of their income, even for years to come, unlike other deductions, like those for charitable giving. Certain industries, like real estate or oil and gas, are a well-known source of tax benefits that can generate paper losses even for a successful business."}

Rittenhouse was charged with five felonies: first-degree intentional homicide, first-degree reckless homicide, attempted first-degree intentional homicide and two counts of first-degree recklessly endangering safety.\n\nThe two-week trial – which captured America's attention and was in many ways emblematic of the divided nation – featured testimony from more than 30 witnesses, including Rittenhouse himself, video clips from the night of the shootings and heated exchanges between the attorneys and the judge.\n\nAnd while the jury's decision drew harsh criticism from the victims' loved ones, legal experts say they were not surprised by the verdict.\n\nThese were the factors experts said helped lead to Rittenhouse's acquittal.\n\nRittenhouse's testimony was key\n\nAmong the trial's most key moments was the testimony from Rittenhouse, who told the court he acted in self-defense when he shot Rosenbaum, who he said threatened him earlier, chased him, threw a bag at him and lunged for his gun. At one point, 18-year-old Rittenhouse broke down in tears while on the stand.\n\n\"If I would have let Mr. Rosenbaum take my firearm from me, he would have used it and killed me with it and probably killed more people,\" he testified.\n\nRittenhouse referred to the other people he shot at as part of a \"mob\" chasing him, telling the court Huber came at him, struck him with a skateboard, and grabbed his gun. Rittenhouse shot him once in the chest, killing him. Finally, he said he saw Grosskreutz lunge at him and point a pistol at his head, so Rittenhouse shot him, he testified.\n\nDefense attorney Mark Richards told reporters Friday in his mind, 'it wasn't a close call' whether to put Rittenhouse on the stand.\n\n\"We had a mock jury and we did two different juries, one with him testifying and one without him testifying. It was substantially better when he testified... and that sealed it,\" Richards said. \"If you don't put a client on the stand, you're going to lose, period.\"\n\nHis testimony was key for several reasons, according to legal experts.\n\n\"Number one, you humanize him... More important, number two, he explained his uses of force,\" CNN legal analyst Joey Jackson said.\n\nRittenhouse's testimony gave jurors the ability to hear what he thought at the time and whether he believed he was in danger – a claim the prosecution, ultimately failed to undermine, former federal prosecutor Elie Honig said.\n\n\"They (prosecutors) pointed out some sort of minor inconsistencies and things he said on the night of, and said later, but nothing that undermines sort of the core defense argument, which was, he was attacked,\" Honig told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on Friday. \"Every time he shot, he was attacked.\"\n\n\"The prosecution did not make enough of a dent in Kyle Rittenhouse,\" Honig added.\n\nState did not prove Rittenhouse provoked violence\n\nWhat the trial came down to, according to civil rights attorney Charles F. Coleman Jr. were two competing narratives: one of Rittenhouse being a victim who was attacked, and one of being a vigilante who provoked the violence.\n\n\"The jury bought the narrative of Kyle Rittenhouse being a victim, they thought that his self-defense claim was a lot stronger than the prosecution's provocation claim,\" he said."}

The withdrawal occurred as Canada and its military allies braced for imminent attack and to allow for the American-led mission to eventually meet its Aug. 31 deadline for departure. The Associated Press reported that U.S. officials said 11 American marines and one navy medic were killed in the attack by a pair of suicide bombers and gunmen in the crowd clamouring outside Kabul airport. It's not known how many other U.S. personnel were injured. An unknown number of Canadian military personnel stayed behind to assist the American withdrawal, and all were \"safe and accounted for\" after the Thursday bombing, the Canadian Forces said on Twitter. Canada's departure, its fiery aftermath, and the concerns about those left behind laid bare the raw emotional scars of the firmly severed connection in the long-suffering country. There, Canadian blood was spilled alongside its western allies to help the Afghans build a prosperous country after the Taliban was routed in 2001. Its estimated more than 47,000 Afghan civilians, as well as over 66,000 members of the Afghan national military and police also died in the war.\n\n\"I'll just say from our perspective, warfare is always chaotic, and unpredictable.

The 117th Congress will convene on Sunday.\n\nThe legislation's approval in the House came after Trump signed a sweeping coronavirus relief bill into law Sunday evening. That measure, which was negotiated on a bipartisan basis, provides for $600 in direct payments, but after a deal was brokered and passed out of Congress, Trump railed against the amount as too low and called for $2,000 checks instead, which House Democrats seized upon to push for an increase.\n\n\"I'll ask consent for the final time that the Senate set a time for a vote on the House bill to provide $2,000 checks.

But the group periodically updates its Top Safety Picks as new vehicles come out.\n\nAs it happens, in fact, IIHS conducted its final of six crash tests on the Genesis GV80 the day after the Woods crash.\n\nSo far this year, 50 of about 200 vehicles that have been fully tested by IIHS have received the top award.\n\nTo earn the Top Safety Pick+ designation, which is one step above Top Safety Pick, cars must meet a variety of criteria, including:\n\n• Receiving \"good\" ratings in all six IIHS crash tests.\n\n• Offering \"superior\" or \"advanced\" front crash prevention protecting against collisions with other vehicles and pedestrians.\n\n• Providing \"good\" or \"acceptable\" headlights in all trim levels and packages.\n\nTiger Woods faces difficult recovery after crash The single car crash in Southern California caused significant injuries to Tiger Woods' right leg.

It requires intensive engineering planning at the early stages.\"\n\nWhile new vehicles are substantially safer than vehicles from decades earlier, they are not impervious to deadly accidents. More than 36,000 people were killed in car crashes on American roadways in 2019, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nOn social media, some people speculated that the SUV's safety features may have saved the golf legend's life.\n\nThe Genesis GV80's safety systems include:\n\n• 10 standard airbags, including one that deploys in the center of the vehicle as well as a driver-side knee airbag.\n\n\"The vehicle is loaded up with airbags,\" Latouf said.\n\n• Advanced driver assistance systems, including forward-collision alert avoidance, stability control, evasive steering technology and an interior camera that alerts the driver if they're falling asleep.\n\n• New vehicle architecture, known in the industry as a \"platform,\" built with a passenger compartment reinforced with high strength steel to provide rigidity in case of a crash.\n\n\"Safety is foundational to the brand at Genesis, and it's really important that we deliver on that promise,\" Latouf said.\n\nThe 2021 Genesis GV80, which carries a starting price of nearly $50,000, also has a 14.5-inch horizontal touchscreen on the center console and an 8-inch digital instrument panel."}

This one comes courtesy of royal biographer and expert Andrew Morton, who is currently making the rounds doing tons of Sussex-specific press to promote the updated paperback edition of his book .\n\nAccording to Morton, Harry and Meghan passed on a title for their son because of fears that Archie might be bullied if they accepted. Apparently, this was not a general, kids-pick-on-royals fear and a much more specific concern because of the title Archie was in line to inherit.\n\n\"[Archie] could have taken the title 'the Earl of Dumbarton,' which is an honorary title, but [Harry and Meghan] decided against that because they felt that the word 'dumb' in the word 'Dumbarton' would have been used as mockery when Archie went to school,\" Morton told Us Weekly of the Sussexes' supposed reasoning.\n\nIt's also worth noting that in addition to the reason being up for debate, the entire question of whether or not Harry and Meghan were even given a say in Archie's status as a titled royal—honorary or otherwise—is a bit contentious. While early reports did suggest that the couple had made the decision to raise Archie without a title, Meghan offered a much different version of events earlier this year during the Sussexes' sit-down interview with Oprah Winfrey.\n\n\"They didn't want him to be a prince or a princess, which would be different from protocol,\" Meghan said during the interview. \"It was really hard....This went on for the last few months of our pregnancy where I'm going, 'Hold on a second. How does that work? If he's not gonna be a prince, he needs to be safe.'\"\n\nOf course, Meghan was referring to the possibility of Archie being named a prince, while Morton is discussing an honorary earl title, so it's possible that both of these things are true—i.e., that the Royal Powers That Be denied making Archie a prince and that Harry and Meghan then passed on the honorary title on his behalf."}

There were obvious hazards on the set.\"\n\nAuthorities said Friday that Halls, the assistant director, had handed the weapon to Baldwin and announced \"cold gun,\" indicating it was safe to use. But it was loaded with live rounds. Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was fatally shot and director Joel Souza, who was standing behind her, was wounded.\n\nBaldwin, who is known for his roles in \"30 Rock\" and \"The Hunt for Red October\" and his impression of former President Donald Trump on \"Saturday Night Live,\" has described the killing as a \"tragic accident.\"\n\nEarlier Issues\n\nThe production of \"Rust\" has been beset by disputes from the start in early October and included seven crew members walking off the set just hours before the shooting. The Los Angeles Times, citing two crew members it did not name, reported that five days before the shooting, Baldwin's stunt double accidentally fired two live rounds after being told the gun didn't have any ammunition."}

We cited everything from lack of payment for three weeks, taking our hotels away despite asking for them in our deals, lack of COVID safety (and on) top of that, poor gun safety!

The Justice Department declined to comment.\n\nJury selection begins in Chavin's state case on March 8 — he faces second-degree murder and manslaughter charges — with opening statements scheduled for March 29.\n\nFloyd, a Black man, died May 25 after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against Floyd's neck while he was handcuffed and saying he couldn't breathe. Floyd's death sparked protests in Minneapolis and beyond and led to a nationwide reckoning on race.\n\nThree other officers — Thomas Lane, J. Kueng and Tou Thao — are charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter and are scheduled to face trial in August. Like Chauvin, all three were fired soon after Floyd's death.\n\nThe increased federal grand jury activity in connection with Floyd's death comes as the Justice Department, under President Joe Biden, is expected to focus more on civil rights issues, criminal justice overhauls and policing policies in the wake of nationwide protests over the death of Black Americans at the hands of law enforcement.\n\nAt his confirmation hearing this week, Judge Merrick Garland, Biden's nominee for attorney general, emphasized his commitment to combating racial discrimination in policing, telling the Senate Judiciary Committee that America doesn't \"yet have equal justice.\"\n\nFormer Attorney General William Barr had previously said that, as is standard department policy, the Justice Department was first going to allow a state prosecution to move forward before the federal investigation would be resolved. It's unclear what specifically prompted the increased grand jury activity in the last few weeks, though most federal grand juries are discharged after about 18 months.\n\nChauvin was prepared to plead guilty to a state charge of third-degree murder in Floyd's death before Barr personally blocked the plea deal last year, two law enforcement officials with direct knowledge of the talks told the AP. Barr rejected the deal in part because he felt it was too soon as the investigation into Floyd's death was still in its relative infancy, the officials said."}

Legally, it will be more difficult.\n\nAs thousands clad in Donald Trump hats and wielding Trump flags stormed the US Capitol last Wednesday, it was Trump's own words just prior to the riot urging them to \"fight\" that is being blamed for the violence that ensued.\n\nAccording to the House resolution laying out the article of impeachment the US House of Representatives is expected to debate this week, it was Trump's speech at the Ellipse, just across the street from the White House, that is the evidence for their allegation that Trump \"engaged in high Crimes and Misdemeanors by inciting violence against the Government of the United States\".\n\nThe resolution states that \"shortly before the Joint Session\" to count the Electoral College votes and certify President-elect Joe Biden's victory \"commenced, President Trump ... reiterated false claims that 'we won this election, and we won it by a landslide'\".\n\n\"He also willfully made statements that, in context, encouraged – and foreseeably resulted in – lawless action at the Capitol, such as: 'if you don't fight like hell you're not going to have a country anymore',\" the resolution continues.\n\n\"Thus incited by President Trump, members of the crowd he addressed ... unlawfully breached and vandalized the Capitol, injured and killed law enforcement personnel, menaced Members of Congress, the Vice President, and Congressional personnel, and engaged in other violent, deadly, destructive, and seditious acts.\"\n\nThe House impeachment effort boils down to Trump's uttering of \"if you don't fight like hell you're not going to have a country anymore\".\n\nImpeachment versus legal guilt\n\nThe impeachment process is inherently a political one, not a legal one, meaning while members of Congress generally refer to legal language when considering whether a president committed \"high crimes and misdemeanours\", there is no requirement that Congress needs to legally prove that the accused is guilty of those crimes, though generally there is a lot of effort to gather as much evidence as possible.\n\nBecause the process is driven by politics, it is therefore driven by American sentiment towards the accused president and whether a majority of Americans agree with the accusations. In this case, a poll released on Sunday is the first indication that impeaching Trump might not be a very controversial move.\n\nIn the ABC News/Ipsos poll, 67 percent of Americans said Trump deserves a great deal or good amount of blame for the riot, including 69 percent of independents but only 31 percent of Republicans.\n\nThe same poll suggested that 56 percent of Americans think Trump should be removed from office before his term ends on January 20.\n\nThat is a significant difference from when Congress impeached but failed to remove Trump from office in 2019-2020. Last year, Americans were split throughout the entire process, with a clear majority never materialising to punish Trump.\n\nThe difference in Americans' opinions is a likely indicator the process this time around could move more quickly with much less controversy. Certainly, the political winds will give members who vote to impeach significant political cover against those who argue this process is happening too quickly, dispensing with the traditional lengthy investigation and deliberation given to previous successful impeachment efforts.\n\nBut just because Congress says Trump is guilty of \"inciting\" the riot, does not mean he is guilty in the eyes of the law. Congress's actions could result in Trump being removed from office or preventing him from holding office again, but it does not meet the legal bar of actually holding him liable for the illegal behaviour and destruction of the Capitol caused by the rioters.\n\nAnd that legal bar is quite high, according to experts.\n\nThe former District of Columbia assistant attorney general, Jeffrey Scott Shapiro, who has experience successfully – and unsuccessfully – convicting protesters for incitement, argues Trump did not violate any incitement laws with his speech.\n\nShapiro, who currently serves as a Trump appointee to the US Agency for Global Media, pointed out in a Wall Street Journal op-ed on Sunday: \"In the District of Columbia, it's a crime to 'intentionally or recklessly act in such a manner to cause another person to be in reasonable fear' and to 'incite or provoke violence where there is a likelihood that such violence will ensue'.\"\n\nIn addition to the \"fight\" language the House resolution cites, Shapiro mentions that another of Trump's lines from his speech is being held up as evidence of incitement: \"We're going to cheer on brave senators and congressmen and -women, and we're probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them. Because you'll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength and you have to be strong.\""}

It also studied whether political content from news organisations was amplified on Twitter, focusing primarily on US news sources such as Fox News, the New York Times and BuzzFeed.\n\nThe study compared Twitter's \"Home\" timeline – the default way its 200 million users are served tweets, in which an algorithm tailors what users see – with the traditional chronological timeline where the most recent tweets are ranked first.\n\nThe research found that in six out of seven countries, apart from Germany, tweets from rightwing politicians received more amplification from the algorithm than those from the left; right-leaning news organisations were more amplified than those on the left; and generally politicians' tweets were more amplified by an algorithmic timeline than by the chronological timeline.\n\nAccording to a 27-page research document, Twitter found a \"statistically significant difference favouring the political right wing\" in all the countries except Germany. Under the research, a value of 0% meant tweets reached the same number of users on the algorithm-tailored timeline as on its chronological counterpart, whereas a value of 100% meant tweets achieved double the reach. On this basis, the most powerful discrepancy between right and left was in Canada (Liberals 43%; Conservatives 167%), followed by the UK (Labour 112%; Conservatives 176%). Even excluding top government officials, the results were similar, the document said.\n\nTwitter said it wasn't clear why its Home timeline produced these results and indicated that it may now need to change its algorithm. A blog post by Rumman Chowdhury, Twitter's director of software engineering, and Luca Belli, a Twitter researcher, said the findings could be \"problematic\" and that more study needed to be done. The post acknowledged that it was concerning if certain tweets received preferential treatment not as a result of the way in which users interacted, but because of the inbuilt way the algorithm works.\n\n\"Algorithmic amplification is problematic if there is preferential treatment as a function of how the algorithm is constructed versus the interactions people have with it. Further root cause analysis is required in order to determine what, if any, changes are required to reduce adverse impacts by our Home timeline algorithm,\" the post said."}

Authorities did not have any immediate information on injuries.\n\nOther video showed water rushing through Newark Liberty International Airport as the storm moved into New York on Wednesday night.\n\nThe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the airport, tweeted at 10:30 p.m. that all flights were suspended and all parking lots were closed due to severe flooding. All train service to the airport also was suspended.\n\nThe National Weather Service recorded 3.15 inches of rain in New York's Central Park in one hour, far surpassing the 1.94 inches that fell in one hour during Tropical Storm Henri on the night of Aug. 21, which was believed at the time to be the most ever recorded in the park.\n\nNew York's FDR Drive, a major artery on the east side of Manhattan, was underwater by late evening and subway stations and tracks became so flooded that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority suspended all service. Videos posted online showed subway riders standing on seats in cars filled with water.\n\nOther videos showed vehicles submerged up to their windows on major roadways in and around the city and garbage floating down a street in Queens.\n\nAt the U.S. Open tennis tournament in Queens, television footage showed fans who had watched matches under the Arthur Ashe Stadium's retractable roof slogging through several inches of water as they left.\n\nFew parts of the region were untouched, and residents huddled inside and endured the anxiety brought on by tornado warnings that gradually moved north and east with the storm.\n\nThe roof collapsed at the Postal Service building in Kearny, New Jersey, with people inside, police Sgt. Chris Levchak said. Rescue crews were on scene into the night, with no immediate word on the number of people or severity of injuries.\n\nGov. Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency in all of New Jersey's 21 counties, urging people to stay off the flooded roads. Meteorologists warned that rivers likely won't crest for a few more days, raising the possibility of more widespread flooding.\n\nSoaking rains prompted the evacuations of thousands of people after water reached dangerous levels at a dam near Johnstown, a Pennsylvania town nicknamed Flood City.\n\nIda caused countless school and business closures in Pennsylvania. About 150 roadways maintained by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation were closed and many smaller roadways also were impassable. Several thousand customers were still without power late Wednesday night.\n\nSome areas near Johnstown, whose history includes several deadly floods, saw 5 inches or more of rain by mid-afternoon, an inundation that triggered an evacuation order for those downstream from the Wilmore dam. Nearby Hinckston Run Dam was also being monitored but appeared stable by late afternoon.\n\nBoth dams were considered high-hazard dams that are likely to kill someone were they to fail.\n\nEvacuees were taken to a nearby high school with help from the Red Cross, National Guard, local transit authority and school transportation services, he said.\n\nThe 1889 Johnstown flood killed 2,200 people, a disaster blamed on poor maintenance on the South Fork Dam on the Little Conemaugh River. It sent a 36-foot wall of water roaring into a populated area at 40 mph (65 kph).\n\nHigh water drove some from their homes in Maryland and Virginia. The storm killed a teenager, two people were not accounted for and a tornado was believed to have touched down along the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland.\n\nThe National Weather Service had predicted flooding from what remained of Hurricane Ida, saying steep terrain and even city streets were particularly vulnerable to a band of severe weather that extended from the Appalachians into Massachusetts."}

Some media outlets finally reported on evidence that supported his self-defense claims and one critic called for \"revisiting\" the clearly biased reporting in the case.\n\nKYLE RITTENHOUSE RECOUNTS KENOSHA RIOTS, REACTS TO MEDIA PORTRAYAL OF TRIAL IN FIRST INTERVIEW SINCE ACQUITTAL\n\nHowever, there is one person whose status has not changed: Norfolk Police Officer William Kelly, who was fired for simply donating to the Rittenhouse defense fund and writing a supportive note as a private citizen. He made the comment and donation anonymously. The only thing more shocking than Kelly's loss of his job is that Norfolk City Manager Chip Filer and Police Chief Larry Boone have retained theirs.\n\nI criticized the firing of Kelly last April as a blatant attack on free speech. The termination occurred after Kelly made a $25 donation to the defense of Kyle Rittenhouse. He made the donation anonymously and added the comment \"God Bless. Thank you for your courage. Keep your head up. You've done nothing wrong. Every rank-and-file police officer supports you.\"\n\nEarly in the Rittenhouse case, activists sought to cut off Rittenhouse's ability to raise money for his defense by harassing donors and (successfully) pressuring companies like GoFundMe to block contributions.\n\nA criminal defense in any case (let alone a high-profile case with ramped up prosecution teams) is hugely expensive. That financial threat can prompt some to plead guilty. That is why people want to help fund such defenses to guarantee true access to a fair trial. Activists and GoFundMe did everything they could to block such efforts and increase the pressure on this teenager to just plead guilty.\n\nBack to Kelly. This is an officer who had served for almost 20 years when he contributed to the defense. As a police officer, Kelly likely saw the defense grounds more clearly than most people. The jury ultimately agreed with his view that Rittenhouse acted in self-defense.\n\nNevertheless, activists learned his identity and demanded his termination. City Manager Filer rushed to satisfy the mob. He fired Kelly with the support of Police Chief Boone and declared \"his egregious comments erode the trust between the Norfolk Police Department and those they are sworn to serve.\"\n\nKeep in mind the \"egregious comments,\" that there are officers who support Rittenhouse and believe in his defense, were said anonymously. Kelly has pointed out that Boone was allowed in uniform to publicly march with Black Lives Matter protesters. Yet, he was fired for anonymously making a supportive donation and a statement to a legal defense fund.\n\nVarious public officials, including Vice President Kamala Harris, have contributed to the The Minnesota Freedom Fund, which \"pays criminal bail and immigration bonds for those who cannot otherwise afford to as we seek to end discriminatory, coercive, and oppressive jailing.\"\n\nThe vice president and others have the right to support such legal defense funds, which aim to ensure litigants have the means to defend themselves. So does Kelly.\n\nWhen Kelly was fired, many on the left celebrated despite the fact that he was being denied his rights to free speech and free association. It is a pattern I have written about in the past as public employees are fired for statements on social media or associations in their private lives.\n\nThis includes a New Jersey police officer fired for calling BLM protesters \"terrorists\" on her personal Facebook account. Most recently, a court reinstated Loudoun teacher Byron \"Tanner\" Cross, who was fired for speaking publicly against gender identification policies.\n\nAs it stands, Kelly was fired for supporting (again, anonymously) a teenager who was ultimately acquitted of all charges by a jury. He was fired for contributing to a legal fund that would help the accused put on a full defense. That is in the interest of justice.\n\nYet, Filer and Boone remain employed despite using their official positions to retaliate against a public employee using his constitutional right to free speech. Kelly and his family continue to appeal his firing as they struggle to survive on the teacher's salary of his wife.\n\nThe dictator Idi Amin once proclaimed \"There is freedom of speech, but I cannot guarantee freedom after speech.\" That seems the standard applied in Norfolk, where even anonymous support for a legal defense is grounds for termination."}

During the sit-down, host Stephen Colbert acknowledged that CNN has been \"the story in many ways\" over the last couple of weeks, before more directly addressing Cuomo's termination on Dec. 4 following a third-party investigation commissioned by CNN into his conduct regarding sexual assault allegations made against his older brother, former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.\n\nWhen asked whether Cooper felt like terminating Cuomo was the \"right thing to do,\" the anchor shared that while he feels for Chris and his family, journalism has ethics and standards that come with \"repercussions\" when not adhered to.\n\n\"I don't want anything bad to happen to somebody who's a colleague and somebody who is a friend of mine, and I feel terrible for him and for his family,\" Cooper stated. \"That being said, look, journalists have strict ethics and strict rules that we are to abide by, and if you don't abide by them, there are repercussions. And I wish Chris the best, and I'm sorry for how all of this played out, and I hate this for his family. But this is — it's a business with very big responsibilities, and there are repercussions.\"\n\nCooper denied he had been notified about Cuomo's firing ahead of CNN's announcement on Dec. 4 and asserted that he had no knowledge the news organization held any meeting notifying the staff.\n\n\"I don't know. Maybe,\" Cooper said when asked by Colbert if employees were made aware in a staff meeting, before quickly following up, \"No, no. Of course not. They would have a staff meeting and say like, 'Oh we're going to do this thing, but don't tell anybody'?\"\n\nWhen asked whether anyone was surprised by Cuomo's firing following a year of public discussion over the anchor's potential conflicts of interest with regards to covering his brother, Cooper responded that people were certainly surprised \"when it happened.\"\n\n\"I don't know about surprise overall but I mean, it didn't happen, and then it did happen very quickly,\" Cooper said. \"I think people were surprised the day it actually happened, when it happened.\"\n\nLater in their discussion, Colbert asked Cooper whether had spoken to any of his other colleagues at CNN, including fellow anchor Don Lemon — who both acknowledged is close to Cuomo. Cooper said that while he hadn't talked to Lemon since Cuomo's firing, the first person who reached out was Andy Cohen.\n\n\"You know, the first call after I got the news was from Andy Cohen, who was like, 'Do you think I could get that show?' I was like, 'Andy, you've got enough real estate in television,'\" Cooper said, to laughs. \"Andy believes he is fully qualified to host a presidential debate because he hosts the Housewives reunion.\"\n\nPrior to his termination, Cuomo was suspended by CNN on Nov. 30 after the New York Attorney General's office released transcripts and other documents that shed new light on his involvement with his brother's response to several sexual harassment allegations, according to a statement CNN provided to THR. During that time, a review was conducted by an outside law firm as part of a \"further evaluation of new information that came to light\" about Cuomo through the AG's investigation.\n\nAt the time CNN announced Cuomo had been terminated \"effective immediately,\" the network also revealed that \"additional information has come to light\" but offered no other details. That same Saturday, The New York Times reported that during the review, an allegation of sexual misconduct had been made against the younger Cuomo by a former junior colleague at another network, according to lawyer Debra S.

Tobin is a lung specialist who supported prosecutors' argument that Floyd died from asphyxiation as a direct result of Chauvin and two other officers pinning him to the ground. She said she found him especially credible because he wasn't paid for his testimony.\n\n\"He was fantastic,\" Howard said. \"He was very, very convincing. He was probably my favorite.\"\n\nHoward also praised Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, who testified that his department doesn't train officers to use the tactics Chauvin employed.\n\nHoward, who identified herself during the jury selection process as the biracial daughter of a white mother and Black father, said she didn't like how defense attorney Eric Nelson was so confrontational with witness Donald Williams III, who was standing nearby as Chauvin, who is white, pinned Floyd to the ground with his knee on the Black man's neck for 9 minutes, 29 seconds.\n\nNelson tried to make Williams \"seem angry and emotional in a negative way,\" Howard said. \"(Williams) did an excellent job staying poised and truthful in his testimony.\"\n\nShe added it wouldn't have made a difference if Chauvin had decided to take the stand in his own defense.\n\n\"If he had something he really, really wanted to say to get off, he would have,\" she said.\n\nHoward is the second juror to speak publicly about the guilty verdict. Brandon Mitchell told The Associated Press in April that convicting Chauvin was an easy decision.\n\nMitchell, who is Black, defended himself in May from accusations that he was biased against Chauvin after word surfaced that he attended a protest last August in Washington D.C. to commemorate Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech while wearing a T-shirt that read \"GET YOUR KNEE OFF OUR NECKS\" and \"BLM,\" short for Black Lives Matter.\n\nFloyd, who was Black, died on May 25, 2020, after Chauvin and two other Minneapolis police officers pinned him to the pavement while he was handcuffed.

Though the law generally requires money mistakenly wired to be returned to its sender, Furman in his ruling cited an exception in New York that allows recipients to keep funds if they discharge a valid debt and if the recipient is not aware of the mistake upon its receipt of the funds. Because the payment was applied to existing loans, and the lenders did not make any misrepresentations to induce the accidental repayment, Furman said the wire transfers were \"final and complete transactions\" and not subject to revocation. The decision follows what Furman called \"one of the biggest blunders in banking history\": a full loan repayment of $893 million that Citibank mistakenly wired when it simply intended to pay approximately $7.8 million in interest (some lenders returned part of the overpayment). In an emailed statement to Forbes, Citigroup said it \"strongly disagrees\" with the court's decision and intends to appeal the ruling. Shares of Citigroup are edging up 0.7% Tuesday, pushing the stock's one-year gain to about 6.5%.\n\nKey Background\n\nThe blunder in August added fuel to regulatory scrutiny facing Citigroup over its internal record-keeping practices, and in October the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency fined the bank $400 million for deficiencies in risk management, data governance and internal controls.

Magness will soon depart ERCOT following a 60-day termination notice handed to him by ERCOT's board of directors in March.\n\nIn the weeks since the winter storm, both ERCOT and the Public Utility Commission of Texas, the regulatory body that oversees it, have been lambasted for failures in preparing for and responding to the storm.\n\nERCOT underestimated the maximum amount of power that would be demanded by homes, businesses and industry during a severe winter storm in its fall projections, and it overestimated the amount of power generation that would be available to the grid during such a storm.\n\nLt. Gov. Dan Patrick had called for Magness and DeAnn Walker, then the head of the PUC, to resign. While Magness was fired, Walker resigned after also coming under harsh criticism from lawmakers. Gov. Greg Abbott called for reforming the governance of ERCOT, and legislation to do so is advancing through the Legislature.\n\nBut after recent leadership shakeups at ERCOT and the PUC, it is state lawmakers who are now increasingly coming under pressure to pass substantial legislation that would protect the state from another power failure the next time inclement weather hits Texas.\n\nAn immediate concern Jones must confront at ERCOT is the prospect of an atypical summer that pushes demand for electricity beyond normal summer peaks. Texas is likely to see a hotter and drier summer than normal this year, according to an April climate outlook from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and 2021 is likely to rank among the 10 warmest years on record globally."}

In 2019, Twitter said it was working on Bluesky, a project focused on creating \"an open and decentralized standard for social media\" that could help the site better combat online abuse and misinformation. The social network also began testing a forum called Birdwatch that lets users spot misleading tweets and weigh in on why they think the information is wrong.\n\n\"We want to stay ahead of where the market is moving and where people are moving,\" Dorsey said at Goldman Sachs' virtual Technology and Internet Conference on Wednesday. \"I believe so much that this trend will come to pass.\"\n\nIn the 40-minute interview, Dorsey spoke about a variety of topics, including regulation and Twitter's plans to explore revenue outside of advertising.\n\nHere are some highlights:\n\nMoving beyond the tweet: Twitter needs to move beyond 280-character tweets in order to add to the \"public conversational layer of the internet,\" Dorsey said. The company has been testing \"fleets,\" a tool that lets you share content that disappears in 24 hours. It's also been experimenting with an audio chatroom feature called Spaces, and acquired the newsletter platform Revue. Twitter is trying to make it easier to follow topics and interests.\n\nTwitter can also become a place for recruiting, Dorsey said, noting that people are using the site to find others they want to work with or to share interests. \"We don't want to be seen as just the thing that shows you what's happening right now,\" he said.\n\nRegulation: US lawmakers have been eyeing changes to a federal law called Section 230 that shields internet companies from liability for content posted by users. Dorsey referred to the growing debate, saying more transparency around content moderation was needed. But he also noted that changing Section 230 could impact online reviews, message boards and other content on the internet. Twitter is in \"active discussions with regulators,\" he said, but cautioned that some proposals could reduce competition or \"the spirit of an open Internet.\"\n\nContent moderation: Twitter's efforts to label misinformation and its permanent ban of former President Donald Trump have rubbed some conservative users the wrong way, prompting them to bolt from the platform to explore alternatives, such as Parler and Gab. Dorsey, though, doesn't seem too worried about a drop in daily users. He said that 80% of Twitter's users are outside the US and that the service has more than 50 accounts with more than 25 million followers."}

We are a very small school system with only four schools.\"\n\nIt was one among hundreds of examples of school systems grappling with how to respond to vague threats afloat on social media in the wake of the tragedy at Oxford High, which left four dead and seven seriously injured. These kinds of disturbing messages are spiking in the D.C. area and nationwide: At least 60 schools in Michigan closed this month in the wake of the Oxford shooting, as did districts in Ohio and Pennsylvania. And in a \"challenge\" last week that swept the social network TikTok, students promoted school shootings to take place on Dec. 17 — for many, the last day of class before winter break. Schools from D.C. to California closed for the day or added police.\n\nMore than 150 threats surfaced nationwide in just the week after Oxford, said James Densley, a professor of criminal justice at Metropolitan State University and a co-founder of the Violence Project. By comparison, Densley, who tracks news reports, recorded 151 school threats for the entire month of September this year — itself a fivefold increase over the number seen in a typical September, he said.\n\nEvery threat sets off alarm bells, putting staffers, parents and students on edge — and forcing administrators to make a choice. Should they close schools, an option that is more attractive in a post-pandemic world in which many students can learn from home? Or should they take a risk in an effort to minimize learning disruption? Assessing the danger of each threat is not always obvious.\n\nFor Jason Enix, superintendent of the Reading Community City School District just outside Cincinnati, the decision was clear. When a social media post surfaced earlier this month promising a student was going to \"shoot up the school,\" Enix opted to have students learn virtually the next day. \"It was an easy call to make,\" he said. \"We would make that call every single time.\"\n\nBut when Daniel McGarry, superintendent of the Upper Darby School District in Pennsylvania, faced a similar situation in early December, before the Oxford attack, he kept students learning in a \"lock-in\" scenario, under which teachers continue teaching but nobody is allowed to leave their classroom. \"Our last resort is to close schools,\" McGarry said.\n\nExperts are similarly conflicted — emphasizing the need to err on the side of caution but warning of possible downsides.\n\n\"I think we have to take every single threat very seriously right now — it doesn't matter how it might seem innocuous,\" said Laurel Thompson, who is on the board of the School Social Work Association of America (SSWAA) and was involved in the response to the 2018 shooting in Parkland, Fla. \"We never know which one is going to be the one. We never want to make a mistake.\"\n\nAmy Klinger, founder and director of programs for the Educator's School Safety Network, commended schools for taking threats seriously. But she said she would like to see fewer campus shutdowns, because a return to virtual learning can cause trauma and anxiety for students who suffered in that environment during the pandemic. And, she warned, school closures could lead to even more threats surfacing on social media.\n\n\"A kid could think, 'I made a threat and it worked, we don't have school, so I'm going to do that again,'\" Klinger said. \"And copycats create copycats and you get into this cycle of threat closure, threat closure, threat closure, so it's very difficult.\"\n\n'Fake accounts ... fake threats'\n\nThe threats run the gamut."}

Morris, Mich., that has sold door locks to 300 school districts in Michigan and about 10,000 districts across the country.\n\n\"It's not a lock until it needs to be, it's a piece of hardware that mounts to the door and another piece that mounts to the floor. The locking device is a red handle that lives in a wallbox on the wall beside the door,'' said Cris Ahearn, director of sales for Nightlock.\n\nIn the event of a lockdown or a drill, the box is opened, the red handle removed. One end is slid into a slot into the door; the other end fits into a notch in a metal plate mounted on the floor.\n\n\"If a classroom door has glass ... and the perpetrator tries to break the glass and reach in and turn the handle to gain entry into the room, they can't do that because the door is locked at the floor,'' Ahearn said.\n\nOxford started installing the locks in 2017, according to Nightlock records. One version installed works on doors that swing outward or inward. Another version works on outward swinging doors which most classroom doors are. Oxford had a mix of both locks at the high school and districtwide.\n\nThe locks average about $50 per door.\n\nThe alleged shooter never entered a classroom during the shooting spree that killed four students and wounded six more students and a teacher on Tuesday, Nov. 30.\n\nThose killed and wounded were fired upon in the hallways.\n\n\"The first thing I thought of was at least they have our locks. Then we're watching it unfold at our computers and at first they were saying no loss of life and we were relieved. Then we found out that was not the case,'' Ahearn said. \"For the whole emotional week we've gone through I keep thinking about how do you lock down the hallways? We can provide safe rooms in every office and every classroom, but if you're in the hallway, then you're exposed and it's tragic.''\n\nOakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard reviewed the crime scene last week and credited Oxford Community Schools with taking safety precautions.\n\n\"There is an extensive camera system thanks to the proactive work of Oxford schools. ... Our liaison taught them ALICE (Alert, Lockdown, Inform, Counter, Evacuate),'' Bouchard said. \"Desks were upturned, doors were barricaded, doors were actually hit by gunfire and so were barricades. But the doors were safe, so that behavior, that training, those protocols saved lives.''\n\nOn Friday and Monday, the phone were ringing at Nightlock's offices.\n\n\"It's not the reason you want the phone to ring, our hearts are broken and devastated. I have friends who have kids that go to that school. It's tragic,'' Ahearn said.\n\n\"A lot of districts are trying to harden their facilities,'' Ahearn said.\n\nNightlock started making residential locks to prevent home invasions after the owners' parents home was broken into while their mom was there. They came up with a residential lock as a hobby and sold it on the internet. They ran their father's steel company full-time.\n\nThen came the 26 deaths in 2021— including 20 children — at Sandy Hook Elementary, in Newtown, Conn.\n\n\"After Sandy Hook, teachers started calling, they wanted these devices for their classrooms but that (residential) device doesn't meet code as far classroom for egress,'' Ahearn said. \"So the lockdown device was designed based on a collaboration with school administrators and code officials to come up with something that is safe and effective. We've been doing that since 2012, since Sandy Hook.\"\n\nShe said in the past week they've received an outpouring of emails and social media posts from parents and children thanking them that the school had the locks."}

We want to live | Derecka Purnell\n\nA jury has found Derek Chauvin guilty of all charges against him for killing George Floyd, including unintentional second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. A judge remanded Chauvin in custody after the verdict and a cop quickly cuffed the dazed defendant to carry him out of the courtroom. Chauvin will remain in jail until his sentencing hearing in two months.\n\nPresidents did what presidents do after the criminal justice system seems to work for the people who it exploits, but this time with a twist. Neither Obama nor Biden considered the verdict justice, but rather accountability and \"a step in the right direction\". Obama emphasized eliminating racial bias in policing and implementing concrete reforms for change; Biden explained that the verdict was a giant step forward towards justice in America.\n\nThere are two fatal flaws with these statements. The first is that reforms cannot fix racial bias in policing because police was formed as a system of racial and economic control, and remains so. As I've written before: if Derek Chauvin were the kindest cop in Minnesota and did not have a biased bone in his body, he still would have been able to arrest George Floyd for any number of alleged illegal acts. Because of capitalism, racism and ableism, the darkest and poorest peoples in the United States are relegated to live precarious lives where they do what they can to survive, sometimes including breaking the law. Rather than eliminating the unjust conditions, cities and the federal government send in police to manage the inequality.\n\nAdditionally, even if we could remove racial bias from police, this would not solve the underlying problems of inequality and exploitation. If it did, then there wouldn't be so many poor, white people in prison. Last week, I watched a video of three cops arresting and slamming a 73-year-old white woman with dementia who was picking flowers on her way home. She'd forgotten to pay for her groceries at Walmart. Police dislocated her shoulder, and tied her hands and feet like a hog. She repeatedly cried that she wanted to go home and they chuckled at her. If removing racial bias in police is supposed to ensure that that Black people will be treated like white people under the law, then equal protection is completely insufficient for anyone's freedom and safety.\n\nAdditionally, we cannot expect cop convictions to save anyone's lives because prior cop convictions did not even save George Floyd's life. Thousands of cops have killed more than 10,000 people of all races between 2005 and 2017; only 82 cops have been charged with murder or manslaughter. According to criminologist Phil Stinson, only 19 cops were convicted and mostly on lesser charges in that time period. A judge sentenced former South Carolina cop Michael Slaeger to 20 years in prison in 2017 for shooting Walter Scott several times in the back. A judge sentenced former Chicago PD officer Jason Van Dyke in 2019 to a little over six years in prison for fatally shooting Laquan McDonald 16 times. Despite the increasing convictions, the police nationwide still kill about three people a day. Just a few years ago, Minnesota convicted a cop for a murder while on duty for the first time. Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor was sentenced to about 12 years. Why didn't all of these convictions save the thousands of people who were killed after them? Why didn't Chauvin get the message?"}

Well, it is an honor to be here at Hampton University with all of you.\n\nI want to thank the President who — Dr. William Harvey, who warmly greeted us on our arrival.\n\nCongresswoman Luria, thank you for your leadership, for Hampton, for HBCUs, for the state of Virginia, and for our country.\n\nMayor, thank you for the warm welcome as well and for all the work that you have done.\n\nI also want to thank Chairman Bobby Scott, the congressman who represents Virginia. He is a huge supporter of our HBCUs and actually is in a committee hearing, I believe today, advocating for the infrastructure bill that we are proposing. And that includes a significant contribution that we intend to make to our HBCUs around infrastructure, as well as research.\n\nI believe we are at the beginning of a new era. I believe that we, in this new era, are more interconnected and interdependent than ever before, as highlighted by the things that you, as our young — our nation's young leaders have witnessed in just this last year and a half.\n\nWe've seen a pandemic, which has really emphasized the significance of our mutual investment in the issue of global health. We have seen cyberattacks, which tells us the role and the use of technology not only for good, as we know it in our everyday lives, but can be weaponized.\n\nWe know it when we think about climate and the extreme weather we've been experiencing — Ida — in terms of the hurricanes; the floods that have happened; in my home state of California, the wildfires. We used to refer to \"wildfire season.\" We don't do that anymore. It's all — year-round.\n\nYou all are the leaders in this new era because, in particular, our nation and our world will require the smart people that you are to lead on issues that require dedication, and a development of skills around science and technology and engineering and math.\n\nAnd Hampton University is one of the leaders — I say, as a Howard graduate. (Laughs.) Couldn't let that go, guys. (Laughs.) I say that knowing, as Vice President, what you're doing here at Hampton University: The partnership between Hampton and NASA — the fact that, I believe, there are four satellites because of Hampton that are right now orbiting, giving us valuable — invaluable information that allows us to not only predict, but to analyze what is happening in our world and in our — and atmosphere.\n\nThis is extraordinary work that is happening. And I'm here to say, as Vice President of the United States, that our HBCUs are some of the great leaders in this vital work that must happen in the new era that not only is an era for our country, but for the world.\n\nSo I'm very proud to be here. And I think about the world — of the challenges, but I think about it in the context of HBCUs. And I am reminded Hampton University educated Mary Jackson — NASA's first Black female engineer. It is from Hampton University that we have Dr. Cooper, who is working on the current Mars mission at NASA right now.\n\nToday, Hampton is the first and only HBCU to fully control a NASA mission. I was just upstairs getting the most recent information on the AIM Satellite, as an example.\n\nAnd so, when we talk about the role of HBCUs on this issue, let's be very clear that HBCUs are not only competing; HBCUs are leading. And it is for that reason that it is in the best interest of our nation, including our national security, to invest in our HBCUs. So, that's why I'm here today, including the fact that this is a week that most of us — year-round, but this week — formally celebrate the role of our HBCUs in our nation.\n\nSo, the agenda for the President and me includes not only doing everything we can to lift up our HBCUs, but to know that if we are to invest in the strength of our nation, we must invest in our HBCUs. And that is why, through our Build Back agenda, that we are making a historic investment in research and development.\n\nOne of the things that you all know is that, historically, our HBCUs have done extraordinary research work. But over the years, some of the facilities have experienced the wear and tear, and we need to invest in allowing our HBCUs to do what all universities should have the ability to do, all education facilities should have the ability to do, which is to upgrade.\n\nI was upstairs, on the roof, admiring that impressive telescope. And one of the points that was made by the professor is that as technology evolves, pieces get smaller, they get less expensive. It makes it more easy for HBCUs to adapt to, then, the new technology and to bring it in, but they need the support. So that's the other point of our emphasis.\n\nAnd then, the point also is about the impact on all of this on our economy. Right? So the demand for STEM workers is high throughout our nation and, frankly, throughout the world. STEM occupations are expected to grow at twice the rate of all other occupations in the next decade.\n\nFor women in the workforce, for women of color in particular — for Black women — STEM careers will help narrow the pay gap. And we must ensure that all people are represented in the fields of STEM.\n\nAnd I'm reminded and think of, for example, the issue of what I call \"machine learning\" — AI — and what that means. Because artificial intelligence is fueling so much of how our systems are analyzing information.\n\nBut understand: Artificial intelligence is, at its core, machine learning. What do we know about any kind of learning? What you learn will likely be a function of who's teaching you and what their life experience and perspective is.\n\nSo, we want to make sure that in this era, where AI is informing so many decisions, that the people who are teaching the machines represent the full gamut of those who will be affected by what the machines decide to do.\n\nSo all of these are critical and important aspects of why I am here today and why the work here at Hampton University, and at so many of our HBCUs, is critically important to all people in our country.\n\nAnd the last point I will make is that, for me, at the core of this is also the importance of self-determination, understanding that this is about ensuring that when we invest in our HBCUs, that we have full participation in our society and in these systems that have an impact on a broad range of people.\n\nAnd that is why the dedication and the investment of our administration and all people should understand the significance of our HBCUs.\n\nSo with that, I am so happy and proud to be with these leaders — with these young leaders. And, Vincent, why don't we start our discussion."}

The average football fan, by now, knows the improbable tale, of a skinny kid from Michigan drafted 199th overall who became the greatest NFL player ever.\n\nBut all the analysis, and glowing stories, and drooling commentators fail to capture just how improbable Brady's accomplishments are. Set aside his sixth-round status for a second. What is the probability that a given drafted player would go on to win seven Super Bowls?\n\nAfter Brady won Ring No. 7 on Sunday night, Yahoo Sports set out to answer that question. We asked sports statistics professors, a major sports data analysis firm and others far smarter than us. We settled on an overly theoretical answer: The odds of a given player winning seven-plus Super Bowls are about the same as your odds of winning the Powerball jackpot if you bought five or six lottery tickets.\n\nThe observed probability is 1 in 26,683. That's the number of professional football players in Pro Football Reference's database. And only one of them has now won seven championships.\n\nBut the classical, theoretical probability?\n\nRoughly 1 in 51.8 million. Or 0.0000019%. Or 19 in a billion.\n\nThe math behind Tom Brady's improbability\n\nHow'd we calculate that? We started by narrowing the question: Put yourself back in April 2000. Exactly 254 players are about to be picked in the NFL draft. If you were to randomly select one of those players, without knowing anything about how his life would transpire, what is the probability that player would win seven-plus Super Bowls?\n\nTo answer, we pulled data on career length from Pro Football Reference. We made the (overly simplistic) assumption that an average player's Super Bowl odds in a given season are 1/32. And we asked stats whiz Vince Jansen to build a model that would tell us the likelihood of a random player winning at least seven rings.\n\nThe model showed that the theoretical probability of winning at least one Super Bowl was 15.38%. But at least seven? 0.0000019%.\n\nThe actual math is ridiculously complex – think equations with 80-plus characters. But multiple statistics professors confirmed its validity to Yahoo Sports. Thomas Severini, a statistics professor at Northwestern University, suggested framing the results with a different question: How many players would need to be drafted for there to be a 50% chance of one winning at least seven Super Bowls?\n\nThe answer, he says, is roughly 36 million.\n\nAnd three experts – including Severini and Mark Glickman, a statistics professor at Harvard – independently came up with another mind-blowing number: Even if you were to guarantee that the randomly selected player would have a 21-year NFL career, the theoretical probability of that player winning seven-plus Super Bowls is 1 in 435,119 – or 2.3 in a million.\n\nIn other words, an average NFL player who spent 21 seasons in the league would have a 0.00023% chance of doing what Tom Brady has done.\n\nWhat if we specify 'quarterback'?\n\nThe first caveat to those minuscule probabilities is that they wouldn't be quite as small once we know that the random player is a quarterback. QB careers last longer than the average player's. They're more likely to yield several Super Bowls.\n\n\"If it's not a quarterback, it's not gonna happen,\" says Abraham Wyner, a stats professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business.\n\nSo we made a second set of calculations. Rather than use the 2000 draft class as our sample for career-length data, we used all QBs drafted from 1985-2004. The probability that one of them would win seven or more Super Bowls?\n\nRoughly 1 in 12.8 million. Or 0.0000078%. Or 78 in a billion.\n\nSo, four times more likely – but still ridiculously improbable.\n\nThe one major caveat\n\nThe more important caveat is that the assumption mentioned above – that the player's Super Bowl odds in a given season are 1/32 – isn't a realistic one."}

The issue took on new urgency after a Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol by supporters of then-President Donald Trump who were trying to overturn Biden's election victory.\n\nThe new strategy stopped short of calling for new laws to fight domestic threats, and officials on Tuesday did not offer many details on specific new resources.\n\n\"We concluded that we didn't have the evidentiary basis, yet, to decide whether we wanted to proceed in that direction or whether we have sufficient authority as it currently exists at the federal level,\" said a senior administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in advance of the announcement.\n\nIn a speech on Tuesday, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in the \"coming days and months\" he would convene an interagency task force dedicated to combating domestic terrorism.

The Washington Post described a conversation between the not-yet president and not-yet secretary of defense in which Rumsfeld told Bush that US military power was needed to discipline the world. \"I left no doubt in his mind but that, at that moment where something happens, that I would be coming to him to lean forward, not back.

He declined to have the charges read against him in court.\n\nThe ex-cop wore a tan shirt in what appeared to be a conference room – a yellow pad in front of him – at Minnesota's maximum-security prison in Oak Park Heights outside of Minneapolis, where he's serving a 22 1/2-year sentence for Floyd's murder. He spoke briefly, answering short procedural questions and entering his plea.\n\nA federal grand jury indicted Chauvin and three other former officers in May for allegedly violating Floyd's constitutional rights.\n\nChauvin also was charged in the separate indictment involving the Minneapolis 14-year-old in September 2017, according to the Justice Department.\n\nThe first count of that indictment said Chauvin \"held the teenager by the throat and struck the teenager multiple times in the head with a flashlight,\" the DOJ said in a statement at the time.\n\nA second count said the former officer \"held his knee on the neck and the upper back of the teenager even after the teenager was lying prone, handcuffed, and unresisting, also resulting in bodily injury.\"\n\nChauvin is accused of willfully depriving the teenager's \"constitutional right to be free from the use of unreasonable force by a police officer,\" according to a DOJ statement at the time.\n\nFloyd's death on May 25, 2020, ignited nationwide protests against police brutality and racial injustice.\n\nBystander video showed Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck for 9 minutes and 29 seconds while the 46-year-old, handcuffed and lying prone in the street, gasped for air, telling the officers, \"I can't breathe.\"\n\nChauvin and former officers Tou Thao, J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane on Tuesday pleaded not guilty to federal civil rights charges stemming from Floyd's death.\n\nChauvin is accused of depriving Floyd's right to be free from \"unreasonable seizure, which includes the right to be free from the use of unreasonable force by a police officer.\"\n\nThao and Kueng also were charged in connection with their failure to intervene in Chauvin's use of unreasonable force, according to the indictment. Chauvin, Thao, Kueng and Lane also face a charge for failing to give Floyd medical aid.\n\nThe indictment said \"the defendants saw George Floyd lying on the ground in clear need of medical care, and willfully failed to aid Floyd, thereby acting with deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of harm to Floyd.\"\n\nTrial dates have not been set in the federal cases.\n\nSeparately, Thao, Kueng and Lane are charged in a state court for aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter in Floyd's death. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThao, Kueng and Lane were on the scene with Chauvin when Floyd was killed.\n\nThe federal charges against the ex-cops are separate from a civil investigation into Minneapolis policing practices announced by Attorney General Merrick Garland in April."}

Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight The attack Friday by multiple suicide bombers hit a Shiite mosque in the southern city of Kandahar during midday prayers. No group claimed responsibility for the attack, but a similar attack in Kunduz last Friday was claimed by the Islamic State.\n\nTaliban police commander Abdul Ghafar Mohammadi said the blasts killed more than 50 and wounded at least 100, and he said he expected the toll to rise as health workers recovered more bodies.\n\nMany \"dead bodies remain under the ruined mosque,\" Hafiz Abdul Hai Abbas, health director for the province, told The Washington Post earlier in the day.\n\nMany fear recent attacks demonstrate that the Taliban — which took over Afghanistan two months ago — is unable to curb other militant and terrorist groups, especially in urban areas. Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State remain active in Afghanistan, and if they grow in power under Taliban rule, the country could again become a haven for those intent on launching international attacks.\n\nLast Friday's suicide bombing in Kunduz was claimed by the Islamic State's Afghanistan branch. The blast struck a crowded Shiite mosque during Friday prayers, killing nearly 50 worshipers and wounding dozens more. The Sunni extremist Islamic State considers Shiite Muslims to be heretics and often targets their places of worship.\n\nThe Islamic State also claimed responsibility for an attack Thursday that killed a Taliban police chief in the eastern province of Konar, according to local media reports.\n\nThe Taliban's ability to maintain tight security in territory under its control has been a core source of its popularity. Now in control of the entire country, the movement is under immense pressure to extend similar protections nationwide. Taliban leadership condemned Friday's attack as \"a big crime\" and ordered the movement's fighters to arrest those behind it.\n\nEyewitnesses told The Post that they heard multiple explosions from the mosque.\n\n\"First, I heard gunfire and then explosions followed,\" said Abdul Jabar Karimi, 40, who was near the blasts. \"Blood was everywhere.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Murtaza Khaledi, 26, said he saw as many as four suicide bombers — two who detonated their bombs near the mosque's entrance, and two who set off their bombs inside the building.\n\n\"Everyone is shocked. Shiites in Kandahar were never attacked before,\" Khaledi said.\n\nFootage from inside the mosque showed several bloodied bodies on the floor, some covered in sheets, while onlookers wailed. The Taliban said it had sent its elite forces to the site to investigate.\n\nBut Kandahar is not a part of the country that has seen significant Islamic State activity previously. The province is the Taliban's historic heartland, and has great symbolic value and a rural population that has traditionally supported the militants.\n\nThe United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan also condemned the attack on what it said was Kandahar's largest Shiite mosque. The U.N. statement put the number of dead at 30.\n\n\"Those responsible need to be held to account,\" the mission tweeted."}

While there was no evidence that Woods, who received a ticket for reckless driving after a minor accident in 2009 and pled guilty to driving under the influence in 2017, was inebriated, County Sheriff Alex Villanueva reported that it appeared that the star was speeding at the time of the crash.\n\nAt approximately 7 am in the morning, Woods' SUV collided with a raised median, crossed two oncoming lanes of traffic, and struck a tree. The vehicle is thought to have rolled over several times before coming to rest on its side. This is known as a 'rollover' accident, which is more likely to result in fatal injuries than other types of crashes. The golf mogul's injuries, while not fatal, were serious: they included open tibia and fibula fractures, which were compound (meaning that the bones broke through the skin) and comminuted (meaning that the bones were in fragments). After undergoing emergency surgery, which involved the insertion of rods, pins and screws into his legs, Woods is now in recovery.\n\nWhile clearly fortunate to have escaped death, the ramifications of such serious injuries are of great concern, both for Woods himself and the golfing world at large. Widely regarded as the greatest golf player of his generation, his dazzling array of accolades include eighty-two PGA tour wins, five Masters Tournament victories (the latest of which was in 2019), and six-hundred and eighty-three weeks ranked world number one. Woods, age forty-five, placed his professional career on indefinite hold after a fifth spinal surgery in December 2020, and sports commentators fear that the debilitating injuries from his car crash may catalyse his retirement.\n\nIn a statement released on Twitter, however, Woods thanked the medical professionals who took care of him at the Harbour-UCLA Medical Centre and Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre, and assured fans that he is 'recovering at home' and 'working on getting stronger every day'. As of yet, he has given no indication that he is considering retirement. One of the more optimistic commentators, former PGA Tour player Bill Mallon expressed hope for the star's return to professional tournaments in an interview with BBC golf correspondent Iain Carter. Emphasising that Woods received immediate treatment and did not suffer from infection, Mallon estimated that his fractures could heal in as little as six weeks, and posited that the star would return to professional golf in a year."}

The latest round includes 1 million payments, with the IRS noting they have an official payment date of May 12. That means the most recent recipients will receive a direct deposit on Wednesday, or soon get a paper check or pre-paid debit card in the mail.\n\nThe timing and delivery of checks has been a cause of anxiety for some people, especially for those who receive government benefits such as Social Security and don't typically file taxes. The IRS prioritized sending checks to people who have already filed their 2019 or 2020 tax returns, since the agency was able to quickly verify eligibility based on income and also determine where to mail or direct deposit the checks.\n\nFollowing that initial distribution of checks, the IRS vetted payment data for government benefit recipients, with recipients of Social Security benefits among those still receiving their checks. On Wednesday, the IRS said the payments arriving this week include more than 460,000 \"plus-up\" payments for people who were owed more stimulus funds than they initially received.\n\nThe agency said it's sending another 500,000 payments to eligible people who recently filed a tax return but for whom it didn't previously have information to issue a stimulus check.\n\nAbout half of the newly issued checks were sent via direct deposit, with the other half sent through the mail via paper checks or pre-paid debit cards, the IRS said.\n\nFourth stimulus check?\n\nSome lawmakers are pushing for a fourth round of payments even as the IRS continues to distribute the third stimulus checks.

The Suez Canal Authority (SCA) said it had lost the ability to steer amid high winds and a dust storm.\n\nEight tugboats were working to free the vessel, blocking a lane key to Asia-Europe trade through which about 50 ships a day passed in 2019, according to Egyptian government statistics.\n\nGAC, a Dubai-based marine services company, said the Ever Given had been partially refloated and moved alongside the canal bank, citing information from the SCA.\n\n\"Convoys and traffic are expected to resume as soon as the vessel is towed to another position,\" GAC said on its website.\n\nBernhard Schulte Shipmanagement (BSM), the ship's technical manager, said it ran aground in the canal at about 0540 GMT on Tuesday.\n\nEgyptian forecasters said high winds and a sandstorm hit the area on Tuesday, with winds gusting as much as 31mph.\n\nBSM said all crew were safe and accounted for, and there had been no reports of injuries or pollution.\n\nA growing number of tankers were gathering near the entrance to the canal on Wednesday morning waiting to pass through. Seven vessels carrying 6.3m barrels of crude oil were among those unable to pass, the research firm Kpler said, with another three carrying an additional 2.5m barrels scheduled to try to make the passage by the end of the week.\n\nThe accident was probably due in part to strong winds that turned the containers above deck into a vast sail that blew the vessel off course, said Jamil Sayegh, a former captain and maritime law specialist with experience navigating the canal. \"The force generated by the wind would have unintentionally altered the heading of the vessel,\" he said.\n\nBut he added that human error may also have been a factor since ships traverse the canal in convoys and none of the vessels behind the Ever Given had run into similar troubles.\n\n\"Ships are machines run by propulsion engines with rudders that are almost identical in all vessels. The variables on board are the software and the personnel.\"\n\nVessels passing through the Suez are obligated to use Egyptian pilots to help them navigate the stretch, he said.\n\nWeather forecasts would have shown that winds were strong on Wednesday, but he said both canal authorities and mariners tried not to delay passage.\n\n\"If you delay this vessel at Suez anchorage, it means you are making the ship owner to lose $60,000 [£44,000] per day or $3-4000 per hour of delay,\" said Sayegh, the Beirut agent for the shipping journal Lloyd's.\n\nThe incentive not to pause journeys had grown more acute with the rise of just-in-time supply chains in recent decades, said Peter Sand, the chief shipping analyst with Bimco, an international association for shipowners.\n\n\"For decades shipping has been the invisible conveyor belt at sea, enabling large manufacturing industries like automative to do just-in-time shipments, even though from time to time shippers are calling foul in terms of the reliability of the schedule,\" he said. \"Some production lines may be halted due to containers being caught in traffic like this.\"\n\nLars Jensen, the chief executive of SeaIntelligence Consulting, said delays increased the risk of congestion at European ports. \"When the canal reopens, this will mean that the delayed cargo will now arrive at the same time as cargo behind it which is still on track,\" he said.\n\nThe Ever Given is one of a new category of ships called ultra-large container ships (ULCS), some of which are even too big for the Panama canal, which links the Atlantic and Pacific.

The Democrat had originally planned to travel to Washington by Amtrak, which he rode to and from Washington throughout his Senate career, but the option was scrapped amid threats of violence against the president-elect.\n\nBiden is slated to deliver remarks with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris at a COVID-19 memorial later Tuesday, before spending the night at Blair House, the president's official guesthouse.\n\nHe will be inaugurated on Wednesday.\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden arrives in Washington, D.C., from Delaware on Tuesday. He will appear at a memorial for COVID-19 victims at the Lincoln Memorial in the evening. Biden will spend the night at Blair House, the president's official guesthouse, and will be inaugurated as the nation's 46th president on Wednesday.\n\nHere's what else is going on:\n\n3:30 p.m.\n\nIn his farewell address, President Donald Trump says he will pray for the success of the next administration.\n\nThe White House released excerpts of the video address ahead of its planned release Tuesday afternoon, a day ahead of President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration. In the video, Trump will say, \"This week, we inaugurate a new administration and pray for its success in keeping America safe and prosperous.\"\n\nTrump will also address the storming of the Capitol building by his supporters after he directed them to \"fight\" the election results showing he lost.\n\nHe will say that \"all Americans were horrified by the assault on our Capitol\" and that \"political violence is an attack on everything we cherish as Americans\" and \"can never be tolerated.\"\n\nTrump will also trumpet what he sees as his top achievements in office, including efforts to normalize relations in the Middle East.\n\nHe'll say: \"We did what we came here to do — and so much more.\"\n\n3:15 p.m.\n\nPentagon officials say 12 Army National Guard members have been removed from securing President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration after vetting by the FBI, including two who posted and texted extremist views about Wednesday's event.\n\nThere was no specific threat to Biden.\n\nTwo U.S. officials told The Associated Press that all 12 were found to have ties to right-wing militia groups or posted extremist views online. The officials, a senior intelligence official and an Army official briefed on the matter, did not say which fringe group the Guard members belonged to or what unit they served in. The officials were not authorized to speak publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.\n\nGen. Daniel Hokanson, chief of the National Guard, confirmed Tuesday that the Guard members had been removed and sent home but said only two were for inappropriate comments or texts related to the inauguration. The other 10 were for other potential issues that may involve previous criminal activity, but not directly related to the inaugural event.\n\nThe officials told the AP they had all been removed because of \"security liabilities.\"\n\nIt's unclear whether they will face discipline when they return home.\n\n2:05 p.m.\n\nIn an emotional farewell, President-elect Joe Biden promised that even as he departs for Washington, D.C., to be sworn in, \"I'll always be a proud son of the state of Delaware.\"\n\nSpeaking Tuesday at an event at the National Guard headquarters in Delaware named for his late son, Beau, Biden's voice became thick with emotion as he told the crowd that \"when I die, I've got Delaware written on my heart.\" He said that \"it's deeply personal that our next journey to Washington starts here — the place that defines the very best of who we are as Americans.\"\n\nBiden gave farewell remarks to about 100 people, including numerous Delaware elected officials and members of Biden's family.\n\nHe's leaving Wilmington via plane Tuesday afternoon and will appear at a memorial for COVID-19 victims at the Lincoln Memorial in the evening. Biden will spend the night at Blair House, the president's official guesthouse, before moving into the White House after he is sworn in Wednesday.\n\n1:55 p.m.\n\nTen additional U.S. Army National Guard members are being removed from the security mission for the presidential inauguration of Joe Biden, according to a senior U.S. intelligence official and a U.S. Army official briefed on the matter. The two officials spoke on condition of anonymity citing Pentagon regulations.\n\nEarly Tuesday morning, the FBI sent a list of names to the National Guard Bureau who were identified as having ties to fringe right-wing groups or had posted extremist views. No active plots against Biden were found. The information was passed from the National Guard Bureau to the D.C. National Guard."}

He doesn't shy from any question nor does he hide from any answer given.\n\nHe's an emotional sort, too, so it wasn't surprising McIlroy became a tad irritated during his conference call with reporters Wednesday ahead of the World Golf Championships-Workday Championship at The Concession Golf Club when a couple questions irked him.\n\n\"He's not Superman,\" McIlroy said when asked if Woods was the guy who can come back from his horrific car crash that left him with multiple, serious injuries to his right leg, ankle and foot.\n\n\"He's a human being at the end of the day,\" McIlroy continued. \"And he's already been through so much. At this stage I think everyone should just be grateful that he's here, that he's alive, that his kids haven't lost their dad.\n\n\"That's the most important thing. Golf is so far from the equation right now, it's not even on the map at this point.\"\n\nWoods, 45, was involved in a single-car rollover crash early Tuesday morning in the Los Angeles area. He was awake and responsive after surgeons at the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center operated on his right leg; he shattered the tibia and fibula and suffered significant injuries to his right foot and ankle. A rod was inserted to stabilize his tibia and a combination of screws and pins were used to stabilize the ankle and foot.\n\nMcIlroy, 31, also was miffed about a query wondering if there was any talk about paying tribute to Woods during the tournament.\n\nGallery Photos: Tiger Woods through the years View 32 photos\n\n\"Like you say 'pay tribute to him.' He's not gone,\" McIlroy said. \"He's been in a very bad accident. We're very lucky that he's still here. I feel like we should pay tribute to him every day for being on the PGA Tour and what he's done for golf.\n\n\"It's always great when he plays at a tournament or is out here because it gives that tournament an extra dimension that it usually doesn't have. We're all sort of heading towards that day that Tiger wasn't going to be a part of the game. I'm not saying that that was soon. Before this accident, he was rehabbing a back injury and hopefully going to come back and play this year. It's inevitable that one day he won't be a part of it, and that's going to be just something that the game of golf and the Tour is going to have to deal with and adapt to.\n\n\"Obviously, hopefully, he comes back and is able to play, but if he's not, I think he'll still be a part of the game in some way, whether it's obviously his design business and his foundation and hosting golf tournaments. It may be the end of seeing the genius at work with a club in his hand, but there's still a lot of other ways that he can affect the game in a great way.\"\n\nAs for his own game, McIlroy, the former world No. 1 and four-time major champion, hasn't won since the fall of 2019 and is coming off a missed cut in last week's Genesis Invitational at Riviera Country Club north of Los Angeles. But in his next start after missing his last five cuts, McIlroy has two wins, a second, a fourth and a tie for 12th.\n\n\"It's funny, it's going to sound really weird, I worked so hard the week before Riviera in that week off, but I felt so unprepared to play, if that makes sense,\" he said. \"I stood on the range for hours a day hitting golf balls and working on my swing but didn't play golf. Didn't chip, didn't putt, didn't do any of the things that you need to do to shoot scores.\n\n\"So even though I worked hard and worked on some stuff, I feel like it's sort of like clockwork. I have these weeks where I want to work on some things and fix some things and I try to cram everything in in the space of a week when it's probably something that should take two or three months to iron out.\n\n\"I went to Riviera after feeling like I worked hard but was completely unprepared because I had sort of neglected sort of all other aspects of the game. I think I learned a couple of things last week. I was thinking way too much about the golf swing last week, even when I was out on the course."}

Rystad Energy's Oil Markets Analyst, Louise Dickson, has commented on developments:\n\n\"It's not often that hackers manage to hit such crucial oil infrastructure such as Colonial's pipelines in the US, but such an event and the associated fear of prolonged outages has taken over the psyche of traders, and oil prices are on the rise.\n\nThe malware hit the heart of the US downstream network and prices of refined products are increasing amid the disruption, causing a bullish rollover effect on crude benchmarks, with both WTI and Brent boosted in early trading.\n\nThe pipeline, which usually transports more than 2.5 million bpd of refined products from the US Gulf Coast to the Northeast, has so far pushed up prices of gasoline and diesel, as the expectation is that both will be in short supply as long as the pipeline is sidelined.\n\nSimilar to the February freeze crisis, the impacts will be localized. While northeastern and southeastern states may see increased prices at the pump, other regions with more robust products inventories, such as the US Gulf Coast, may not see the same price surge.\n\nThe other obvious upside is for European refiners, which may be able to step in and increase refined product exports to the US, though the arbitrage opportunity will likely be met by cargoes already at sea, as the two-week journey over the Atlantic at this point is still a gamble if the pipeline is swiftly restored.\n\nThe pipeline closure could also mean that US crude exports, which surged to 4.1 million bpd last week, are kept onshore and fed into domestic refineries to replenish inventories.\n\nStorage in the northeast and southeast regions of the US are poised to be heavily tapped in the coming days as the pipeline remains offline.\n\nThe bullish developments in the US are hiding a worrying Covid-19 trend in Asia. While some oil demand destruction in India is being registered and priced in, the pandemic is also hitting other southern and southeast Asian countries, where infections are on an alarming upward spiral.\n\nBefore the US pipeline hack, the worsening Covid-19 situation in Asia was set to have a bearish effect on prices and dominate the week, but now it is limiting the bullish effect of the US pipeline hack instead.\n\nIf the pipelines come back online quickly this week, the market may be in for a price correction that will make the impact of the pandemic's spread in Asia more visible."}

Consciously and cynically selling the public on a new, multiracial vision of American interventionism, Weinberger led Reagan's dirty wars in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. Here, Powell began to make his most notable impact on Defense Department policy, where he and his boss formulated the Powell-Weinberger Doctrine. The doctrine stresses that if diplomatic efforts have reached their limits, the military should use \"overwhelming force,\" restricted by clear objectives and exit strategies to maintain vital national security interests.\n\nWhen Bush Sr. was elected President, Powell was promoted to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and he got his first chance to test the doctrine for himself, spearheading the U.S. invasion of Panama. Clarence Lusane, a professor at Howard University, who visited Panama shortly after the invasion, recently recounted what he saw on Democracy Now!: \"There were mass graves. There was the total destruction of neighborhoods. They bombed — these were poor neighborhoods, we should be clear. So, there were wealthy neighborhoods that were surgically missed, while they bombed neighborhoods that had not only been active, but had been — you know, very much embodied people who live there. So, it was a horrific invasion. And Powell said nothing about it.\" \"And these were Afro-Panamanians.\" Despite appeals to diplomacy, clear objectives, and exit strategies, Powell's doctrine is one extreme deadly force meant to advance America's imperial aims.\n\nPowell proved in the following years that he would violate his own doctrine if ordered to do so. No proof was more infamous than when he sold lies about Sadam Hussein's alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction to the American public and the international community, drumming up support for the invasion of Iraq, a quagmire of a conflict for which the United States did not have attainable objectives nor a clear exit strategy. Here lies the heart of Colin Powell's lasting legacy in the world. The incalculably horrendous endeavor, which, by the lowest estimates, killed hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians, was enabled by the very man whose name lines the halls of City College. No words can do justice to the pure devastation, which the United States wrought on the people of Iraq, and no convoluted excuses concerning CIA director David Tenet's last-minute introduction of false intelligence to Powell, nor apologies well past due, would stand up to the Geneva Conventions or the International Criminal Court. Colin Powell, reservations and all, went in front of the General Assembly of the United Nations and lent his credibility to the illegal invasion of Iraq. He never paid the price for it. He lived out the rest of his days peacefully, earning praise for his philanthropy. If only the people of Iraq were so lucky.\n\n\"A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death.\"\n\n- Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr."}

For almost 10 years, he told his family he wanted to cut it down, but he couldn't afford the expense of a tree-cutting service.\n\nOn Sunday night, as Hurricane Ida started shredding its way through southeast Louisiana, the tree crashed down in his front yard and killed him. It crushed the top of a white truck that Duplessis had just stepped out of on the passenger side, and a broken branch severed an artery in his leg.\n\nThe storm had already knocked out power in the neighborhood. He never saw the tree falling in the total darkness and cascading rain surrounding him.\n\nDuplessis' nephew, Caleb Marcantel, was in the driver's seat and pinned in the truck by the tree. Despite all odds, he climbed out with only a wound to his hand. He ran across the street to get his sister-in-law, a nurse, to help his uncle who was now bleeding out on the driveway.\n\nCrystal Marcantel rushed outside with Caleb to put pressure on the leg while sustained winds of 115 miles per hour roared around them. She tried to stop the bleeding, but she knew the situation was dire. While comforted by his family members, Dennis Duplessis recited the Lord's Prayer, and then uttered his final words – a message to his wife of more than 40 years.\n\n\"Tell Hope that I love her,\" he said, according to his daughter. He passed away within minutes and before paramedics could arrive.\n\nDuplessis, 60, was the first confirmed fatality in the devastating storm system that's now killed dozens and left millions without power, water, or access to essential needs in the scorching summer heat. The storm left a path of destruction across a large portion of the United States, from Louisiana to New York.\n\n\"He always said he'd give his last breath for (his wife), and he wanted to go before her,\" said Duplessis' daughter, Chasity Fatherree. \"He was out here trying to hook up the generator for her. And he went before her.\"\n\nFour days after his death, Fatherree stood in her father's driveway while volunteers from nearby churches sawed away at the nearly giant tree that's still laying in their front yard, a reminder of the tragic accident that unfolded earlier this week.\n\n\"He hated that tree,\" Fatherree said.\n\n\"The what-ifs and the timing is all I can think about,\" she added. \"I close my eyes and I just see the tree hitting him. It's just, it's horrible – the tree that he hated.\"\n\nNo one expected the storm to carry so much strength as it moved inland from the gulf. By the time the storm hit Gonzales, which is about 67 miles northwest of New Orleans, it was still a Category 3 hurricane, after initially making landfall as a Category 4.\n\nWhile Gonzales and the larger Baton Rouge area were spared the same devastation that struck other parts of Southeast Louisiana, it still tore down power lines and trees. In Ascension Parish, which includes Gonzales, nearly 26,000 customers were still without power as of Friday night, five days after the hurricane.\n\nHistoric church built by freed slaves is badly damaged\n\nStorms like Ida change lives. The damage can't be measured solely by the physical destruction; storms also take symbols of the past.\n\nNearly 40 miles southeast of Gonzales, the Whitney Plantation in Edgard has become a historic museum that focuses on the experience of enslaved Africans. Joy Banner is a descendent of enslaved people and now works as the museum's communications director.\n\nShe lives in the area and sought shelter Sunday night in the plantation's mansion, which was built in 1791 by her ancestors. When the sun rose the next morning, she walked out to find the big house and the slave's former cabins were largely spared, but the historic church built by freed slaves after Emancipation was badly damaged. Some structures, like a century-old barn, were completely flattened. The beautiful white picket fence around the property was barely standing.\n\nJoy Banner, the communications director at Whitney Plantation and a descendent of enslaved Africans, shows some of the damage to a church that was built by freed slaves on the plantation, which is now a museum. Ashley Killough/CNN\n\n\"It was such a sinking feeling in my heart,\" she said. \"Just walking around and seeing some of our buildings did collapse, seeing some of the trees and debris all over the site...There was lots of tears. It was such a surreal experience.\"\n\nBanner said she believes much of the damage is restorable, but it could take months before they can reopen."}

Because of coronavirus, social visits only resumed in October, but many facilities have canceled them again as infections spiked.\n\nOne reason for the new nationwide lockdown is that the bureau is moving some of its Special Operations Response Teams from prison facilities to Washington, D.C., to bolster security after President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. Authorities are concerned there could be more violence, not only in the nation's capital, but also at state capitals, before Trump leaves office Jan. 20.\n\nA Bureau of Prisons spokesman said the agency was coordinating with officials at the Justice Department to be ready to deploy as needed. Earlier this month, about 100 officers were sent to the Justice Department's headquarters to supplement security staff and were deputized by the U.S. Marshals Service and given special legal powers to \"enforce federal criminal statutes and protect federal property and personnel,\" said the spokesman, Justin Long.\n\nThe specialized units typically respond to disturbances and other emergencies at prisons, such as riots, assaults, escapes and escape attempts, and hostage situations. Their absence can leave gaps in a prison's emergency response and put remaining staff at risk."}

(\"We will continue to fully cooperate with any and all law-enforcement investigations as they work through the details of this heartbreaking tragedy,\" a spokesperson for the production company behind the movie told CNN.)\n\nBut if multiple media reports, citing accounts from people who were working on the set, reflect the truth, days ran long, proper accommodations weren't provided and morale was low.\n\nA source close to the production told CNN there was a \"full safety meeting\" the day of the accident. But David Halls, the assistant director on \"Rust\" who handed Alec Baldwin the gun that fired the fatal shot, told investigators that he did not check all the rounds loaded in the weapon, a detective wrote in a search warrant affidavit made public Wednesday.\n\nTwo people who worked closely with Halls during productions in 2019 told CNN that he was previously accused of a disregard for safety protocols.\n\nThe woman who acted as armorer on the movie, Hannah Gutierrez, was 24 years old and had recently completed only her first job as head armorer on a film."}

The first batch, amounting to 600,000 payments, went out Aug. 27, and the second batch, on Sept. 17, was much larger, with at least 2 million Californians receiving the benefit. Approximately two-thirds of California taxpayers are eligible for a payment of $600, and some qualifying families will receive an additional $500.\n\nThese state-only checks are part of the $100 billion \"California Comeback Plan\" aimed at providing immediate relief to families and business that've been the most negatively impacted by the pandemic. Gov. Gavin Newsom's office called it \"the biggest state tax rebate in American history.\"\n\nRead on to find out if you'll be getting a Golden State Stimulus II check, what you need to do to get your money, and when your check could arrive. Also, here's everything you need to know about the 2021 child tax credit, which is providing the vast majority of families across the US with advance monthly checks to help cover expenses and basic necessities.\n\nDo I qualify for a $600 or $1,100 payment?\n\nThe Golden State Stimulus II payments are different from the Golden State Stimulus I payments that went out earlier this year. GSS I payments -- a one-time check of either $600 or $1,200 -- went out to those who typically earned less than $30,000 and received the state's Earned Income Tax Credit, or CalEITC, or those who filed their taxes with an Individual Tax Identification Number, or ITIN.\n\nGSS II has been expanded so that more Californians qualify. You're eligible for a $600 payment if you've been a California resident for more than half of the 2020 tax year (you must still be a California resident on the date the payment is issued). You need to also meet the following requirements:\n\nYou filed your 2020 taxes by Oct. 15, 2021.\n\nYour California Adjusted Gross Income, or CA AGI, was $75,000 or less for the 2020 tax year.\n\nYou cannot be claimed as a dependent by another taxpayer.\n\nIf you don't qualify for GSS II, see if you might be eligible for GSS I. Californians who received the earlier GSS I payment could be eligible for a GSS II check for $500 or $1,000 only if they claimed a qualifying child or relative as a dependent on their 2020 tax return.\n\nBesides those who already received GSS I and have no dependents, there are others who are excluded from GSS II payments. Californians whose income is exclusively from other benefits, like Social Security, CalWorks, unemployment or state disability, do not qualify. For more information, check out the Franchise Tax Board's help page.\n\nWatch this: Child tax credit: Everything we know 04:17\n\nHow much money will I get?\n\nFor most Californians who qualify, you do not need to do anything to receive GSS II other than file your 2020 tax return. If you still need to file, you can find different options for filing online, on paper or in person before the deadline on Oct. 15,\n\nIf you'd like to see if you qualify, or estimate the amount of your GSS II, you can go to the Franchise Tax Board estimator. If you have a Social Security number and meet all the GSS II requirements above, you should receive $600 if you had no dependents, and $1,100 if you claimed at least one dependent. Note that some of the payment amounts change depending on whether you received GSS I, whether you have an SSN or ITIN and if you are married filing separately.\n\nWhen will my stimulus payment be sent?\n\nCalifornia's stimulus payments are going out twice a month, or about every two weeks, though some may go out earlier or later. Those who qualify and have already set up direct deposit when filing their 2020 tax return can expect an electronic payment.\n\nMost direct deposit stimulus payments will be issued before Oct. 31. If you filed a state tax return after Sept. 1, you might have to wait at least 45 days for the return to be processed and have a check issued."}

This has already led to a long traffic jam on both sides of the canal, delaying shipments of many commodities, pushing freight rates up, and disturbing seaborne trade flows globally.\n\nThe Suez Canal connects Red Sea with the Mediterranean, thereby linking Asia with Europe. More than 18,000 ships pass through the canal, according to the Suez Canal Authority.\n\nThe Ever Given is still waiting to be towed to clear the blockage after being partially refloated, sources said.\n\nLeth Agencies, a shipping company stationed at the canal, said the refloating of the Ever Given was continuing. \"Two dredgers are expected to commence their efforts tonight around 2000 local time (1800 GMT),\" it said in a notice.\n\nFactbox: Suez Canal blockage sends ripples through global commodity markets\n\nSteel trade only marginally affected by Suez blockage: sources\n\nContainer market braced for further delays following Suez Canal incident\n\nLNG spot shipping market not feeling impact from Suez Canal incident\n\nEarlier on March 24, shipping and logistics company GAC said the grounded ship had been partially refloated and was now alongside the canal bank.\n\n\"Convoys and traffic are expected to resume as soon as vessel is towed to another position,\" GAC said in its latest port update.\n\nThe Ever Given ran aground at about 0740 local time (0640 GMT) on March 23 after it suffered a blackout while transiting in a northerly direction. This caused a halting of all shipments and by March 24 evening, flows on both the northbound and southbound directions were still suspended, sources said.\n\nPRICES, FREIGHT RATES FIRM\n\nOil prices, which lost nearly $8/b in the week ended March 20, got support March 24 from the blockage. ICE May Brent crude futures was trading at $63.90/b, up $3.13/b from its previous settlement as of 1607 GMT.\n\nAlmost 10% of total seaborne oil trade and 8% of global LNG trade passes through the Suez Canal, according to data from the US Energy Information Administration. It is a strategic route for crude oil, petroleum products, LNG shipments and consumer goods.\n\nThe incident was already affecting freight rates on a wide range of ships, with an immediate impact seen on oil tankers and containers.\n\nSpot freight rates for a Suezmax shipping crude from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean were assessed at Worldscale 23 on March 24, the highest level since Feb. 2, according to Platts data. Freight rates in the Mediterranean and Black Sea were also strengthening, with ships stuck in the long traffic jam tightening tonnage, shipping sources said.\n\nThe Platts Container Rate 1 -- North Asia-to-North Continent -- was at $9,500/forty-foot equivalent unit on March 24, up from $1,375/FEU a year earlier, as logistical issues continue to bite.\n\nSeveral container liners are looking to reroute cargoes via the Cape of Good Hope in an attempt to keep shipments moving, although this will cause additional costs in the market. There are already significant delays at European container ports owing to ongoing firm demand and equipment shortages around the world, which have pushed freight rates to all-time highs.\n\nLogjam\n\nS&P Global Platts Analytics said the incident is unlikely to have any long-term effects on shipping rates. But it added that the backlog of ships could take a minimum of five days to clear, with no impact on short-term freight market fundamentals. Demurrage costs, which are charged by shipowners to the consignee when transit is delayed, will be the most likely mechanism to accommodate the delays in transiting the Suez Canal, Platts Analytics said in a recent note."}

In it, Queen Elizabeth says, \"The whole family is saddened to learn the full extent of how challenging the last few years have been for Harry and Meghan.\"\n\n\"The issues raised, particularly that of race, are concerning,\" the statement continued. \"Whilst some recollections may vary, they are taken very seriously and will be addressed by the family privately. Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved family members.\"\n\nWhile the interview aired in the U.S. on Sunday, it was not broadcast until Monday night in Britain. On Monday, the official Instagram account used by Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla, showed him visiting a National Health Service vaccine site in Britain and pointed out his work with a Black church organization to encourage vaccinations.\n\nAmong the bombshell revelations in the interview, Meghan said that there had been \"several conversations\" among the royal family about \"how dark\" their baby's skin would be. Oprah confirmed to \"CBS This Morning\" that Harry said those conversations did not involve Queen Elizabeth or her husband, Prince Philip.\n\nMeghan and Harry also revealed what appeared to be other rifts within the family. Meghan decried an effort to change royal protocols that automatically gave the grandchildren of the monarch a title, starting with their son, Archie. While their son is the great-grandchild of the queen, he is the grandson of the next king, Charles.\n\n\"Even with that convention I'm talking about — while I was pregnant, they said they wanted to change the convention for Archie. Well, why?\" Meghan said. She said she was never given an answer.\n\nMeghan also revealed that a story reported in the tabloids that she had once made her sister-in-law, Catherine, cry in a spat over the flower girl dresses for her wedding was actually \"the reverse\" — as in, Catherine made Meghan cry. She said Catherine later apologized and sent her flowers and a note.\n\nHarry, meanwhile, said he was \"disappointed\" by his father and that, while he loves his brother William \"to bits,\" they're on \"different paths.\"\n\nHarry described an incident last year when the queen suddenly called off an invitation for the couple to visit, and he blamed the palace staff.\n\n\"When you're head of the firm, there is people around you that give you advice,\" he said. \"And what has also made me really sad is some of that advice has been really bad.\"\n\nRoya Nikkhah, a royal correspondent for The Sunday Times, told \"CBS This Morning\" on Tuesday that the interview was \"certainly a crisis\" for the British monarchy.\n\n\"That interview, and I've watched it twice now, has thrown out a lot more questions than answers,\" she said.\n\nAccording to Nikkhah, the interview is \"proving extremely divisive\" to Britons.\n\n\"I've just seen the results of a poll that's just come out here, which shows that a lot of young people here actually support Harry and Meghan doing that interview,\" she said. \"And the older people are firmly, squarely behind the monarchy now. \""}

Dozens of Michigan school districts had already determined that the threats were not credible but some cancelled classes for the day out of an abundance of caution. Many people did not know about the threats until after they arrived at school.\n\nAfter his first-hour class at Canton High School, Mui went downstairs to share the students' concerns with the administration and found a long line of students already outside the attendance office being excused and picked up early by their parents.\n\nThe students were \"more nervous than I've seen them in a classroom before,\" Mui said. \"That's when it kind of hit home for me. I have students in the class that are asking about safety procedures, 'Can we lock the door?' and things like that, which I don't think the students ever cared about, whether the doors locked or not.\"\n\nBy 8:50 a.m. that morning, Plymouth-Canton Community Schools announced the decision to dismiss its three high schools at 9:30 a.m., writing to students, staff and families that although law enforcement had determined that there was no direct threat, \"the fear and anxiety at the P-CEP campus has caused significant disruption to the learning environment.\"\n\nSituations like these are becoming routine in Michigan as the state continues to grapple with the after-effects of the state's deadliest school attack in nearly a century. In the days and weeks following the shootings at Oxford High School, as copycat threats, bomb threats, and real and suspected weapons on campus locked down schools and cancel classes, teachers, parents, and students around Michigan worry about managing an educational environment already fragile from nearly two years of pandemic shutdowns and disruptions. Threats of school violence Dec. 17 were deemed not credible by the Department of Homeland Security, but they still prompted heightened school security or closures in several states across the country, including in Michigan, where the state police acknowledged the threat.\n\nMuch of the stress and uncertainty falls on educators. In interviews across the state, teachers told the PBS NewsHour they are tired, frustrated, and angry about continued gun violence in schools. In addition to their usual lessons – and answering students' questions about school shootings – teachers also have their own questions: How much can teachers manage? And what are the consequences if they don't?\n\n\"I'm now seeing things from the teacher perspective and the parent perspective,\" Stacey Olsen, a social studies teacher at Seaholm High School in Birmingham, said. \"That's giving me even more to contemplate. The professional has become even more personal.\"\n\nStudents have questions\n\nRyan Werenka, an advanced placement government and political science teacher at Troy High School for 22 years, told the PBS NewsHour that every year, a historic event occurs – national, international, or in this case very local – that forces him to set aside his lesson plan and debrief with his students to help them process the information, their thoughts, and their feelings. The day after the shooting at Oxford was that day.\n\nHe said students were unnerved because the shootings happened so close, about 20 miles from their school. Other students expressed fear about whether they were safe on school grounds, while some students were just trying to process why this happened and understand what would happen next."}

John Thune is criticizing Republican activists and party leaders for engaging in \"cancel culture\" by rushing to censure GOP senators who found former President Donald Trump guilty of inciting an insurrection.\n\nIn his first interview since he voted to acquit Trump, the Senate's No. 2 Republican on Thursday defended fellow Republicans who sided with Democrats on the \"vote of conscience\" and warned against shutting out dissenting voices in the party. He also discussed Republicans' priorities under President Joe Biden, the proposed $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package and upcoming primary battles within his own party.\n\n\"There was a strong case made,\" Thune said of the Democrats' impeachment presentation last week. \"People could come to different conclusions. If we're going to criticize the media and the left for cancel culture, we can't be doing that ourselves.\"\n\nThune's remarks were his first explaining his vote in Trump's trial and assessing the turbulent GOP politics the former president has left behind. Thune, who faces reelection next year, is among several establishment Republicans grappling with how to reclaim control of a party dominated by Trump for years.\n\nThe senator rarely criticized Trump while he was in office, but he called the former president's post-election actions \"inexcusable\" and accused him of undermining the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nStill, Thune sided with most Republican senators and GOP Senate leader Mitch McConnell in voting to acquit. Thune and others argued that Trump could not be impeached because he was already out of office. Democrats fell 10 votes short of the 67 need to convict.\n\nSince then, Trump has lashed out at McConnell and repeated the baseless claim that he won the election. The comments have inflamed a feud that is likely to play out in GOP primaries between Trump-backed candidates and those supported by the establishment wing.\n\nThune suggested he would be taking steps to assist candidates \"who don't go off and talk about conspiracies and that sort of thing.\" He praised Rep. Liz Cheney — a Wyoming Republican, who was censured by the Wyoming GOP for voting to impeach Trump — for doing an \"exceptional job on most issues,\" and said he was ready to jump into primary battles like the one she is sure to face.\n\n\"At the grassroots level, there's a lot of people who want to see Trump-like candidates,\" he said. \"But I think we're going to be looking for candidates that are electable.\"\n\nDespite the escalating fight over control of the GOP, Thune said he believes Republicans are well-positioned to take back the Senate, citing policy overreach by the Democrats."}

At the time of suspension, Trump had 88.7 million followers and followed 51 people.\n\nAccording to Gadde's Twitter profile, prior to joining the California-based social media company in 2011, she was senior director of legal at US multinational corporation Juniper Networks. Previously, she worked for nearly a decade at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, a law firm based in California.\n\nGadde serves on the Board of Trustees of New York University Law School and the Board of Directors of Mercy Corps, a global humanitarian aid and development organisation, which partners with communities, corporations, and governments. She is also a co-founder of #Angels, an investment collective focused on funding diverse and ambitious founders pursuing bold ideas.\n\nGadde earned a Juris Doctor (JD) degree from New York University School of Law and a Bachelor of Science (BS) in industrial and labour relations from Cornell University.\n\nShe moved to the US with her parents as a baby and spent most of her childhood in Texas and New Jersey.\n\nIn her free time, she can be found reading fiction or, more likely, chasing her toddler. She also enjoys travelling, cooking and hiking, according to Gadde's profile at Mercy Corps.\n\nAn October 2020 article in Politico said while Gadde keeps a fairly low profile outside Twitter, she is known within the company for being close to the company's CEO during Twitter's highest-stakes moments\".\n\nWhen Twitter chief Jack Dorsey met Trump in 2019, Gadde was in the Oval Office with them. She was at Dorsey's side to meet the Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, in India, it said.\n\nShe had accompanied Dorsey to Washington to speak with legislators and meet with journalists. Inside Twitter's headquarters, Gadde and Dorsey work from spaces next door to each other, the report said.\n\nI can't imagine a world where Jack looks at her and says, 'No.',\" it said, quoting a Twitter official.\n\nA former Twitter official said, \"When it comes to going to war, Jack is the president who gives the order. Vijaya is the chairman of the Joint Chiefs.\" The Politico article said the \"war\" between conservatives and Twitter is heating up, in part because of Gadde's \"unheralded influence\" on the iconic social-media company."}

Ron Johnson in recent weeks as he has sought to downplay the violence committed by supporters of former President Donald Trump.\n\nTestifying publicly for the first time since pro-Trump rioters breached the Capitol nearly two months ago, Wray was pressed by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Dick Durbin on whether the FBI has seen any evidence that individuals involved in the January 6 attack were posing as Trump supporters – a claim the Illinois Democrat called \"the next big lie.\"\n\n\"We have not seen evidence of that, at this stage, certainly,\" Wray responded when Durbin asked if he had seen any evidence the riot was organized by \"fake Trump protesters,\" referring to comments Johnson made during a Senate hearing last week in which he also claimed those involved in the attack were \"agents provocateurs.\"\n\nMost Republicans on the panel did not embrace these conspiracies, but the baseless claim that left-wing infiltrators were responsible for the violent attack has been promoted by Trump's impeachment lawyers, several GOP lawmakers and at least one speaker at the Conservative Political Action Conference last week.\n\nOn Tuesday, Wray made clear that Antifa and other left-wing groups were not part of the violence on January 6, which he called \"domestic terrorism\" – even as several Republicans sought to use the hearing as an opportunity to highlight the threat posed by those groups rather than focus on the Capitol attack.\n\n\"We have not, to date, seen any evidence of anarchist violent extremists or people subscribing to Antifa in connection to the 6th,\" Wray told the Senate committee.\n\nMore than 260 defendants – many of them professing allegiance to Trump, disgust for Congress, and supportive of revolution – have been charged in federal court related to their actions in and around the US Capitol siege on January 6.\n\nPreviously, nearly a dozen Trump supporters charged in connection with the US Capitol insurrection have said that Antifa and other left-wing groups weren't involved in the attack, further debunking the conspiracy among Trump supporters.\n\nAdditionally, Wray testified Tuesday that the FBI is \"not aware of any widespread evidence of voter fraud that would have affected the outcome in the election,\" undercutting a false narrative that was repeatedly pushed by Trump and his allies during the 2020 campaign.\n\nMany Republicans on Capitol Hill have continued to push unfounded accusations of widespread election fraud, which Trump critics have taken to calling \"the Big Lie,\" in the weeks since the January 6 attack despite evidence that such claims helped fuel the deadly riot and warnings they continue to motivate domestic extremists.\n\nWray dodges opportunity to denounce lawmakers who endorse QAnon\n\nWhile Wray spent much of Tuesday's hearing dispelling dangerous false claims, he dodged an opportunity to denounce lawmakers who endorse the QAnon conspiracy theories.\n\nConnecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal said he was \"disappointed\" Wray sidestepped an opportunity to condemn elected officials who have amplified the QAnon claims when asked if they are contributing to the threat of domestic extremism by doing so.\n\n\"Well, certainly we are concerned about the QAnon phenomenon which we view as a sort of loose, sort of set of conspiracy theories, and we've certainly seen domestic violent extremists of the sort that you're describing, who cite that as part of their motivation. And so that's something that we do,\" Wray said.\n\nBlumenthal interrupted Wray for not immediately condemning the idea that lawmakers support the insurrectionists and asked the question in another way: \"When members of Congress, as has happened endorse the QAnon theory, doesn't it worsen the threat of violence?\"\n\nBut Wray still did not take the opportunity to denounce the behavior, prompting Blumenthal to make clear he was disappointed by the response and intends to follow up on the issue in another setting.\n\nIn October, CNN reported that several congressional candidates engaged with the QAnon conspiracy theory of those mentioned, Marjorie Taylor Greene went on to win a seat in Georgia's 14th Congressional District.\n\nWray pressed on 'Norfolk memo'\n\nWray's team of federal investigators is currently chasing thousands of leads in twin efforts to prosecute people involved in the January 6 attack on the US Capitol and to try to prevent feared follow-up attacks in Washington and around the country."}

Eight people were wounded, some critically, including a 14-year-old girl who was placed on a ventilator after surgery.\n\nInvestigators were still trying to determine a motive for the shooting Tuesday at Oxford High School, located in a community of about 22,000 people roughly 30 miles (48 kilometers) north of Detroit, Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard said.\n\n\"The person that's got the most insight and the motive is not talking,\" he said at a news conference late Tuesday.\n\nDeputies rushed to the school around lunch time as more than 100 calls flooded 911 dispatchers with reports of a shooter. They arrested the student in a hallway within minutes of their arrival. He put his hands in the air as deputies approached, Bouchard said.\n\nThe boy's father on Friday bought the 9 mm Sig Sauer used in the shooting, Bouchard said. He didn't know why the man bought the semiautomatic handgun, which his son had been posting pictures of and practicing shooting, Bouchard said.\n\nAuthorities did not immediately release the boy's name.\n\nThe four students who were killed were 16-year-old Tate Myre, 14-year-old Hana St. Juliana, 17-year-old Madisyn Baldwin and Justin Shilling, who died Wednesday.\n\nBouchard said Myre died in a patrol car as a deputy tried to get him to an emergency room.\n\nA teacher who received a graze wound to the shoulder left the hospital, but seven students ranging in age from 14 to 17 remained hospitalized through the night with gunshot wounds, he said.\n\nThe gun the boy was carrying had seven more rounds of ammo in it when he surrendered, Bouchard said.\n\nUndersheriff Mike McCabe said the student's parents advised their son not to talk to investigators. Police must seek permission from a juvenile's parents or guardian to speak with them, he added.\n\nOakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald said in a statement that her office expects to issue charges quickly and that an update would be given Wednesday.\n\nAuthorities were made aware of posts on social media that said there had been threats of a shooting at the roughly 1,700-student school, but Bouchard said they didn't know about the rumors until after the attack.\n\nHe stressed how crucial it is for tips of the kind to be sent to authorities, while also cautioning against spreading social media rumors before a full investigation.\n\nMcCabe also downplayed the significance of a situation in early November when a deer head was thrown off the school roof, which he said was \"absolutely unrelated\" to the shooting. The vandalism prompted school administrators to post two letters to parents on the school's website, saying they were responding to rumors of a threat against the school but had found none.\n\nBouchard said the student in custody had no previous run-ins with his department and he wasn't aware of any disciplinary history at school.\n\n\"That's part of our investigation to determine what happened prior to this event and if some signs were missed how were they missed and why,\" he said.\n\nThe campus was placed on lockdown during the attack, with some children sheltering in locked classrooms. They were later taken to a nearby Meijer grocery store to be picked up by their parents."}

And with a significant percentage of the world's population not yet vaccinated against COVID, the coronavirus has a lot of room to infect people, mutate and, eventually, form new variants. The newest coronavirus variant that health officials are watching is \"delta plus,\" a mutation of the now-dominant delta variant. The original delta is highly contagious, suspected to cause more-severe disease and, according to an estimate by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, responsible for about 93% of coronavirus cases in the US right now.\n\nThough news of coronavirus variants (alpha, beta, delta, lambda and so on) can be overwhelming, not every variant is cause for more concern than the original coronavirus.\n\nWe'll break down what scientists know right now about delta plus, and how concerned we should be about it.\n\nDelta vs. delta plus\n\nIn June, health officials in India called out delta plus as a \"variant of concern\" because it's thought to be better at binding to lung cells and could possibly evade treatments for COVID. Delta plus has been detected in several other regions, including the US, the United Kingdom, Portugal, Russia and China, the BBC reported. South Korea is the latest country to raise a red flag about delta plus, identifying the variant in a man with no recent travel records, according to Reuters.\n\nThe \"plus\" in delta plus refers to the newer variant's K417N spike protein mutation, The Washington Post noted. (Spike proteins are what allows COVID and other viruses to get into our cells.) This mutation, also found in the earlier beta variant, can make certain COVID-19 treatments less effective, according to the CDC, adding emphasis to the warning from India.\n\nWill delta plus be worse than the already horrible delta? To survive well enough and become a dominant variant, a variant needs to infect a lot of people and prove to be more transmissible. So far, delta plus hasn't done that, but more research is needed.\n\n\"You need to study a few hundred patients who are sick with this condition and variant and find out whether they are at greater risk of greater disease than the ancestral variant,\" virologist Dr. Gagandeep Kang told the BBC.\n\nColin Angus, a public health policy modeler and analyst in England, told The Washington Post that \"there is no clear evidence that it (delta plus) conveys enough of a benefit to the virus to allow it to dominate the original delta variant. So although it is clearly here, there is no obvious sign that it has gained a foothold over existing variants of the virus.\"\n\nHow concerned should we be?\n\nAs long as the coronavirus is around and a good portion of the population is unvaccinated, we should be concerned because the virus will continue to mutate, according to US President Joe Biden's medical advisor, Dr. Anthony Fauci.\n\nIn an interview with McClatchy, Fauci said that though \"we're very lucky that the vaccines that we have now do very well against the variants -- particularly against severe illness,\" there could be a variant in the future that will \"push aside\" delta and be as transmissible, cause more-severe disease and get around our vaccines. The CDC refers to these variants as \"variants of high consequence.\" Right now there are none.\n\nGetting the \"overwhelming proportion of the population\" vaccinated will \"crush the outbreak,\" Fauci said. But until then, the coronavirus has \"ample chance\" to morph, he said.\n\n\"People who are not getting vaccinated mistakenly think it's only about them. But it isn't,\" Fauci said. \"It's about everybody else, also.\""}

He limited and reduced federal regulations. He put conservatives — to the tune of over 200 federal judges — on the lower federal courts and three conservative members of the U.S. Supreme Court. He engaged in strong-arm tactics against China. He built part of his wall on the southern border and attempted to reduce, and succeeded in reducing, illegal immigration.\"\n\nForecasting how historians will perceive and treat the 45th president decades from now is a risky endeavor. Perspectives change over time. Yet Perry and other students of politics agree that Trump's trial for inciting insurrection, which begins this week, will likely obscure or taint the most notable accomplishments achieved during his presidency.\n\nOne of his primary distinctions in the history books could be as the only president ever to be formally accused of, and tried for, fomenting rebellion against the government he led.\n\nHistoric proceeding\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives impeached the 74-year-old former president on January 13, charging him with inciting insurrection during an impassioned speech January 6 to supporters before the assault on the Capitol.\n\nTrump's followers wanted to stop a joint session of Congress from certifying Joe Biden's November 2020 election victory. Among the rioters were members of right-wing groups that embrace theories associated with white supremacy.\n\n\"It's a black mark on his record, and if he gets convicted, it's a serious black mark,\" says Susan Low Bloch, professor of constitutional law at Georgetown University Law Center. \"It'll have a huge significance on his life because he won't be able to run again. It'll have significance for his followers because they won't be able to vote for him. And I think it'll be a warning to future government officials not to engage in insurrections.\""}

Colin Powell's funeral at Washington National Cathedral marked a moment of collective mourning in a deeply divided United States. Powell died on Oct. 18 at 84 from complications of covid-19, to which he was especially susceptible despite vaccination because of cancer and Parkinson's disease. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight But, probably because of his and his family's wishes, Powell did not receive a state funeral, and his body did not lie in state at the U.S. Capitol. His service, although televised, was \"private\" and limited only to those invited. President Biden attended but did not speak.\n\nThis format muted some of the debates over Powell's legacy, particularly over the second Iraq War. But it also deprived the public of a chance to come together amid deep fractures centered around covid and debates over racism in America. When marked collectively, the passing of public figures has long allowed Americans to ponder their shared national values.\n\nPowell — the son of poor Jamaican immigrants who rose to become a four-star general in the U.S. Army, the youngest and first Black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as well as becoming the first Black Secretary of State under George W. Bush — is exactly the kind of figure to receive a ceremonial public funeral in the United States: a respected military leader and leading statesman with bonds across party lines.\n\nNational public mourning ceremonies date to Americans holding funeral processions all over the country after George Washington's death in 1799. Washington was not, as Congress hoped, buried beneath the U.S. Capitol, but the spontaneous mourning ceremonies, church services and commemorations (including pamphlets, embroidery and monuments) provided Americans an opportunity to join together in his honor. In the midst of the country's first era of rancorous partisan division, mourning the nation's first president struck a common note of patriotism, even among many who had bitterly opposed Washington himself as president and who reviled John Adams, his successor.\n\nBeginning with Sen. Henry Clay in 1852, presidents, members of Congress and Cabinet leaders periodically have lay in state in the Capitol Rotunda. Since 1865, many of those accorded this honor have lain atop a catafalque (platform) used to hold the coffin of Abraham Lincoln at the Capitol. After Lincoln lay in state, his body was transported to Illinois for burial, attended by throngs of public mourners and days of funeral rituals along the route.\n\nSuch public funerals are designed to celebrate both the dead and the American nation itself, and funerals have provided different Americans with a chance to imagine their connections to one another. No public funeral ever achieves perfect unity, but they all provide opportunities to imagine what American unity could look like, even when the visions differ.\n\nFor example, in 1874, when Sen. Charles Sumner (R-Mass.), a most hated enemy of slaveholding Southerners, died in office, he was surprisingly eulogized by Sen. Lucius Q.C. Lamar (D), a former Confederate from Mississippi, who used the occasion to try to dramatize a vision of sectional reconciliation. The former abolitionist Frederick Douglass also eulogized Sumner, but he argued that Sumner's work for Black equality must continue even if it risked keeping some White southerners alienated.\n\nWhen Douglass died in 1895, members of Congress moved to have his body honored in the Rotunda, but the speaker of the House and Southern senators blocked the motions, and Douglass's huge Washington funeral took place at the Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church instead. The refusal to have Douglass lie in state pointed to how official public mourning rituals were reserved for White men in the 19th century."}

But much of the most significant video capturing the most severe violent crimes from that day still can't be seen.\n\nThat's because the Justice Department and the federal courts haven't proactively made available footage from surveillance cameras around the Capitol and from DC Metropolitan police officers' body cameras.\n\nLast week, the public finally began to see some of that video, because a group of 16 major media outlets led by CNN sued for access. The video releases – just a few in the media coalitions' continued pursuit of dozens – come as some Republicans, inspired by former President Donald Trump's election lies, are denying what happened on January 6, despite injured law enforcement officers like DC Police's Michael Fanone pushing for officials to acknowledge the Trump supporters' unlawful brutality that day.\n\nThe effort to get footage released has taken months. In some cases, the videos became evidence in public portions of Capitol riot defendants' cases weeks ago. But it hasn't even been seen by reporters covering the court proceedings because of the peculiarities of video technology, the unprecedented sweep of the insurrection investigation and structural approaches in the federal court system.\n\nRolling the tapes in court\n\nCNN's work to view video used in court began in March. Two months after the insurrection, federal defendants were appearing in court each day by the dozen. As defendants came through DC District Court following their arrests in their home states, judges held waves of hearings about whether to detain each of them. At those hearings, prosecutors needed to prove the alleged dangerousness of each defendant, showing how violent some were on January 6, especially toward police. The best way to do it, in many cases: Roll the January 6 tapes.\n\nThe tapes showed from police officers' perspectives and unflinching surveillance cameras the violence of the pro-Trump crowd – law enforcement colleagues beaten and dragged and crushed in doorframes; police lines collapsing, completely overwhelmed.\n\nTypically the court press corps sits in the courthouse to watch hearings where these moments are laid out in excruciating detail. But because of coronavirus restrictions, we could only listen to DC federal court proceedings over the phone. The judges, lawyers and defendants, however, recreated their courtrooms over Zoom videoconferences.\n\nAnother technological hitch kept these videos out of sight: While most evidence used in early federal criminal proceedings gets posted on an online public docket, called Pacer, that system can't house videos.\n\nAs these limitations became more apparent every day, CNN and other news outlets started pushing for access. Thousands of hours of video became core to the Justice Department's prosecution of the siege – an overwhelming trove of evidence that would be rolled out gradually to prove scene by scene the behavior of hundreds of rioters.\n\nIn one case, against riot defendant Emanuel Jackson, NBC wrote to his judge and received limited access to a video from the case. In another, Judge Royce Lamberth ordered the court to post videos on its website from the case against the so-called \"Q Anon Shaman\" Jacob Chansley, who had become famous for posing with a horned headdress and a spear-tipped flagpole at the vice president's desk in the Senate.\n\nThen the Justice Department arrested two pro-Trump ralliers for spraying Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who later died, and two other officers with mace-like chemicals along the police line at the front of the Capitol building. It was a significant break in a major January 6 assault case.\n\nThe West Virginia court where one defendant, George Tanios, first appeared allowed reporters to view his detention hearing as a livestream video. Prosecutors played videos of the Sicknick attack one after another, showing how each officer physically reacted to the assault. The judge in West Virginia, Michael Aloi, called the video of Sicknick \"surreal\" and noted how he was impacted by the severity of the chemical spray hitting the officers' faces."}

Lisa Beamer was a wife and mother before she became a symbol of Sept. 11 — and though her celebrity passed, her widowhood cannot.\n\nIn the aftermath of the planes falling from the sky, America and the world were introduced to an array of personalities. Some we had known well, but came to see in different ways. Others were thrown into public consciousness by unhappy happenstance.\n\nSome, like Osama bin Laden and Mullah Mohammad Omar, are dead. But others have gone on to lead lives that are postscripts to Sept. 11, 2001. Here are a few of the boldface names of that tumultuous time — what they were then, and what has happened to them since.\n\nRUDOLPH GIULIANI\n\nTHEN: Mayor of New York City, he was a hero of the moment -- empathetic, determined, a focus of the nation's grief and a constant presence at ground zero. \"The number of casualties will be more than any of us can bear ultimately,\" he said on Sept. 11. Oprah Winfrey pronounced him \"America's Mayor\"; Time magazine declared him \"Person of the Year.\"\n\nSINCE: After suggesting that his expiring term be extended due to the 9/11 emergency -- an idea that was roundly dismissed -- Giuliani went into private life, but not all that private. He launched a profitable security firm and ran abortively for the Republican nomination for president in 2008. His adventures as a supporter of and agent for President Donald Trump are well documented, and resulted in the suspension of his law license in his home state.\n\nBERNARD KERIK\n\nTHEN: New York City's police commissioner. Bald and stocky, he never left Giuliani's side in the days after Sept. 11 -- and followed the mayor after he left office, joining the Giuliani security firm.\n\nSINCE: President George W. Bush appointed Kerik as Iraq's interim minister of the interior in 2003 during the Iraq war, and nominated him to head the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in 2004. He withdrew from consideration when it was revealed that he had employed an undocumented worker as a nanny and housekeeper; there followed a series of legal troubles, including convictions for ethics violations and tax fraud. He was pardoned by President Donald Trump in 2020.\n\nGEORGE W.

Some countries have given emergency use authorization for mRNA vaccines for use in the adolescent age group (aged 12-17 years): BNT162b2 developed by Pfizer, and mRNA 1273 developed by Moderna. In November 2021, one stringent regulatory authority approved the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 for the use in children aged 5-11. Trials in children as young as age 3 years were completed for two inactivated vaccines (Sinovac-CoronaVac and BBIBP-CorV) and these products were approved by Chinese authorities for the age indication of 3-17 years; although these vaccine products have received EUL for adults, they have not yet received WHO EUL for children. Covaxin, an adjuvanted inactivated vaccine developed by Bharat, was approved in India for the age indication of 12-17 years; but not yet received WHO EUL for this age indication. The Indian regulatory authorities have given approval to ZycovD, a novel DNA vaccine, for ages 12-17 years; however, this vaccine has not yet received WHO EUL. Several COVID-19 vaccines are undergoing trials in younger age groups (including as young as 6 months of age), but results have not yet been published.\n\nThe greatest burden of disease in terms of severe disease and deaths remains among older persons and those with comorbidities, the evidence of which led to the WHO Prioritization Roadmap which identifies high priority-use groups according to vaccine supplies available to countries(1). WHO recognizes that various countries are in different pandemic phases with different vaccination coverage rates. The WHO global vaccination strategy targets remain: 40% of each country's population by end of 2021, and 70% by mid-2022(2). These coverage targets were set to ensure an equitable pace of global vaccine rollout & prioritization of those at highest risk. To date, these targets have not yet been achieved.\n\nThis interim statement examines the role of COVID-19 vaccines in adolescents and children in the global context of inequitable vaccine distribution across countries and globally limited vaccine supply.\n\nBurden of disease in children and adolescents\n\nOverall, there are proportionally fewer symptomatic infections, and cases with severe disease and deaths from COVID-19 in children and adolescents, compared with older age groups. Age-disaggregated cases reported to WHO from 30 December 2019 to 25 October 2021(3) show that children under five years of age represent 2% (1 890 756) of reported global cases and 0.1% (1 797) of reported global deaths. Older children and younger adolescents (5 to 14 years) account for 7% (7 058 748) of reported global cases and 0.1% (1 328) of reported global deaths while older adolescents and young adults (15 to 24 years) represent 15% (14 819 320) of reported global cases and 0.4% (7 023) of reported global deaths. Deaths for all ages less than 25 years represented less than 0.5% of reported global deaths."}

And lumber shortages — which existed during former President Donald Trump's administration — were worsened by an unexpected housing boom.\n\nShortages have bedeviled the economy this spring, but most economists attribute the bulk of them to the difficulties of restarting the U.S. and global economies.\n\nA look at the claims and reality:\n\nMCCARTHY: \"Gas prices are the highest since 2014 — just as summer starts. The recent hack of the Colonial Pipeline exposed the flaws of Biden's approach to our country's energy policies. On day one he signed an executive order cancelling the Keystone XL Pipeline.\" — blog post Monday.\n\nREP. LIZ CHENEY, R-Wyoming: \"From cancelling the Keystone Pipeline to banning new oil & gas leasing on federal lands, Biden's energy policies are having devastating consequences. We've already seen a glimpse of this devastation with prices skyrocketing & gas shortages hitting communities across the country.\" — tweet Friday.\n\nTHE FACTS: Biden's action on the Keystone XL pipeline has nothing to do with the recent spike in gasoline prices. The pipeline handles crude oil, running from Canada to Texas through the Midwest, not gasoline, which had shortages on the East Coast after the Colonial Pipeline hack.\n\nBiden's order on his first day in office rescinded the construction permit for an extension to the main Keystone pipeline, which is still operating and runs about 2,687 miles (4,324 km) from Alberta to Illinois and Texas.\n\nAn expanded 1,210-mile (1,947-km) pipeline was planned to allow the system to carry up to 800,000 barrels of crude oil a day, passing through Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska.\n\nBut shortages of crude oil haven't been a factor.\n\nNoteworthy is that while gas prices are at their highest level in six years, oil prices are still slightly below where they were in 2018. That suggests oil supplies are adequate and the refining and distribution of gasoline — through such networks as the Colonial Pipeline — are the problem.\n\nMCCARTHY: \"Despite gas prices being at historic lows this time last year, the average price for a gallon of gas is currently an astounding $3.10. That's the highest it's been since 2014, the last time Joe Biden was in the White House.\" — blog post on Monday.\n\nREPUBLICANS on the HOUSE BUDGET COMMITTEE: \"Biden's policies have led to the highest gas prices in six years.\" — tweet Tuesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: Biden's policies aren't behind the price increases. Gas prices are up because of a rapid and unexpected bounce-back in demand, and because of lingering problems from the forced shutdown early this month of the Colonial Pipeline, which provides 45% of the fuel consumed on the East Coast."}

William Blount set a precedent for an impeachment trial after Trump leaves office\n\nWith so many constitutional questions swirling around the unusual situation of starting an impeachment trial after President Donald Trump leaves office, a look back in history — way back — shows precedent for just that.\n\nWith Trump impeached by the House, a new president assuming office and a Senate trial still to come, the name of Knoxville's William Blount has come back into the spotlight. He has the distinction of being a senator who was impeached and tried after being expelled from office, providing at least some historic clues about trying Trump after he leaves Washington.\n\nIt's not a perfect match, historians said. Trump was impeached for a second time while he was still in office and Blount was impeached after he had already been expelled by the Senate, but the timing has historic parallels.\n\nWilliam Blount's mess\n\nA native of North Carolina, Blount was an original signer of the U.S. Constitution and a Revolutionary War veteran. In 1790, President George Washington named him governor of the newly formed Tennessee Territory and he made his headquarters in Knoxville. When Tennessee joined the union in 1796, Blount was selected as one of the state's first two U.S. senators.\n\nThe fun ended soon after.\n\nThe next year, according to Senate records, Blount was in dire financial straits and he devised a plan using native people and frontiersmen to attack Spanish Florida and Louisiana in order to transfer those territories to Great Britain. The plan – and a handwritten letter detailing it – ended up in the hands of President John Adams who asked the legislature to handle it. It became the Senate's first impeachment case.\n\nSo, what does this early impeachment say about Trump's current situation? Legal experts and historians point to two things. One, again, it allows for an officeholder to be tried once they leave. More relevantly, it shows an impeachment doesn't mean the end of an official's political career.\n\nTried after being expelled\n\nMembers of the House informed the Senate – and a special committee looking into Blount – that they planned to impeach the Tennessean. Soon after, the Senate voted 25-1 to remove him.\n\nThe House went on to impeach but Blount was never convicted. His case was rejected in the Senate on jurisdictional grounds, George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley said. And this kind of trial of a former legislator would be considered inappropriate today, he said.\n\nHistory spotlight: Fingerprints shine a light on the slaves who built Blount Mansion — and Tennessee\n\nBlount didn't even show up for the trial, having already made it back to Tennessee where there was no pressure for him to return. When the Senate sent someone to get him to bring him back to the Capitol (then in Philadelphia), he refused.\n\nLincoln Memorial University constitutional law professor and Blount Mansion board member Stewart Harris said Blount shows that an impeachment trial timeline doesn't matter. The Senate can do what the Senate wants to do, he said.\n\nBut, he added, the Senate might not want to drag its feet before beginning any sort of trial.\n\n\"I think in terms of politics it might be better for the Senate to do it rather expeditiously and get it over with while the memories of the insurrection at the Capitol are fresh and while Trump's term has just recently concluded,\" he said. \"People might consider (holding an impeachment trial) more acceptable to do it at that point.\n\n\"If they wait a year, the politics might shift,\" he continued. \"But constitutionally speaking, they can do whatever they want to.\"\n\nPolitical future after impeachment\n\nSome of the supporters of Trump's impeachment have reasoned that convicting him and then immediately turning to disqualify him from future federal office would create a situation where he doesn't return. Impeachment requires support of two-thirds of the Senate, that is 67 votes, while banning him would only take a majority.\n\nBlount's case is no help with this theory. He was tried after being removed from office, but he was never convicted."}

The United States exported about 3.21 million barrels of oil per day in 2020, according to the Energy Information Administration.\n\nWood Mackenzie analyst Mfon Usoro said that the prolonged shut-in of the WD-143 platform would also affect smaller operators such as LLOG Exploration Co LLC which use the Mars pipeline."}

(AP) — A 15-year-old boy was charged with murder and terrorism for a shooting that killed four fellow students and injured more at a Michigan high school, authorities said Wednesday as they revealed additional details, including a meeting between troubled officials and his parents just a few hours before the bloodshed.\n\nNo motive was offered by Oakland County authorities, a day after violence at Oxford High School, roughly 30 miles (50 kilometers) north of Detroit. But prosecutor Karen McDonald said the shooting was premeditated, based on a \"mountain of digital evidence\" against Ethan Crumbley.\n\n\"This was not just an impulsive act,\" McDonald said.\n\nIndeed, sheriff's Lt. Tim Willis told a judge that Crumbley recorded a video the night before the violence in which he discussed killing students.\n\nCrumbley was charged as an adult with two dozen crimes, including murder, attempted murder and terrorism causing death. During his arraignment, he replied, \"Yes, I do,\" when asked if he understood the charges. Defense attorney Scott Kozak entered a plea of not guilty.\n\n\"He deliberately brought the handgun that day with the intent to murder as many students as he could,\" assistant prosecutor Marc Keast said in successfully arguing for no bail for Crumbley and a transfer to jail from a juvenile facility.\n\nEarlier, Sheriff Mike Bouchard told reporters that Crumbley's parents were called to the school Tuesday \"for behavior in the classroom that was concerning.\" The teen remained in school, and the shooting occurred a few hours later.\n\nBouchard didn't disclose what had worried school officials. He said investigators believe the gun was already in school.\n\n\"There is nothing that he could have faced that would warrant senseless, absolutely brutal violence on other kids,\" the sheriff said, noting that Crumbley had an additional 18 rounds of ammunition when he was arrested.\n\nIn court, Keast said Crumbley entered a bathroom with a backpack and came out with a semi-automatic handgun, firing at students while moving down the hallway. The four students who were killed were 16-year-old Tate Myre, 14-year-old Hana St. Juliana, 17-year-old Madisyn Baldwin and 17-year-old Justin Shilling.\n\nDeputies rushed to the school around lunchtime Tuesday and captured Crumbley within minutes of the shooting. His father bought the 9 mm Sig Sauer gun last week, according to the sheriff.\n\nIt was the deadliest school shooting since the Santa Fe, Texas, High School massacre in 2018, according to The Associated Press/USA TODAY/Northeastern University Mass Killings database. The U.S. has had 31 mass killings this year of which 28 involved firearms.\n\nMcDonald said charges were being considered against Crumbley's parents.\n\n\"Owning a gun means securing it properly and locking it and keeping the ammunition separate,\" she said.\n\nThe shooting should be a wake-up call for new gun laws in a country that has become \"desensitized to school shootings,\" McDonald told reporters.\n\n\"We have to do better,\" the prosecutor said without offering specific changes. \"How many times does this have to happen? How many times?\"\n\nShe also said the terrorism charge fits.\n\n\"What about all the children who ran, screaming, hiding under desks? ... Those are victims, too, and so are their families and so is the community,\" McDonald said."}

'Work-shy William' and 'waity Katie' were left looking like yesterday's royals.\n\nToday, Kate and Wills are the PR golden couple while it's all gone wrong for Harry and Meghan. What happened? Like all media darlings, eventually less favourable coverage began to surface (not least from Meghan's father). There were allegations that she was difficult to deal with, that courtiers were unhappy and leaving in droves — something that her lawyer, given specific permission to speak to the BBC, expressly denied. Then there was so-called tiara-gate, where Meghan was supposedly refused royal jewellery, an incident that resulted in either her or her royal fiance being marched in before the Queen. It is worth noting too, that much of this gossip initially went unreported. Dan Wootton, then of the Sun, explained that it took a good six months before these whispers appeared in the press. A lifetime in news cycles. There was clearly a reticence to go after the new royal pair. But eventually a narrative began to take hold of a demanding couple, insisting on American-style service from a British institution.\n\nIt's the deal they make: they get to live in opulence and in return we, the people who pay for it, who give them that grandeur, receive fragments of their lives\n\nFrustrating, no doubt, but these kinds of stories happen in royal land."}

Cumulatively, Americans have received more than $850 billion of Economic Impact Payments from three different stimulus packages in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. According to new research, here's how most Americans have spent their stimulus checks and how stimulus checks have impacted the economy.\n\nHow did Americans spend their stimulus checks?\n\nThe answer: it depends.\n\nFirst stimulus check: Cares Act\n\nFor the first stimulus check, almost 75% used, or planned to use, their stimulus payments for household expenses. Why? The first stimulus check was mostly disbursed in April 2020 when the unemployment rate was 14.7% and there was greater uncertainty about the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nSecond stimulus check and third stimulus checks\n\nHowever, the spending patterns changed for the second and third stimulus checks. For example, approximately 20% spent or planned to spend their stimulus checks on essential expenses such as food and housing. Americans instead chose to use their Economic Impact Payments to save for retirement or pay off debt. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, here's how the Americans spend their second stimulus check (Consolidation Appropriations Act) and third stimulus check (American Rescue Plan) compared to the first stimulus check:\n\nFirst Stimulus Check: Spend (74%), Save (14%), Pay Debt (11%)\n\nSpend (74%), Save (14%), Pay Debt (11%) Second Stimulus Check: Spend (22%), Save (26%), Pay Debt (51%)\n\nSpend (22%), Save (26%), Pay Debt (51%) Third Stimulus Check: Spend (19%), Save (32%), Pay Debt (49%)\n\nHow Americans spent their stimulus checks Peter G. Peterson Foundation per The U.S. Census Bureau data\n\nHow income level affected stimulus checks\n\nThe first, second and third stimulus checks reached an estimated 85% of households. Stimulus payments targeted lower income and middle income households, with a gradual decline for households earning more than $75,000 annually. The amount of an individual's income impacted how they spent their stimulus payment. While all income levels were more likely to spend their first stimulus check, higher income individuals were more likely to save their stimulus check. This is particularly true in the second and third stimulus checks. For example, in comparison to spending on essential expenses, households that earned more than $150,000 annually were more likely to both save their stimulus check and use their stimulus check to pay off debt. Lower income and middle income households, according to the researchers, may have been less willing to save or pay off debt due to uncertainty regarding the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nHave stimulus checks helped the economy?\n\nThe research is inconclusive how much stimulus checks have helped the economy. That said, Economic Impact Payments \"may have contributed to a rise in\" personal income, consumer spending, personal savings and economic growth. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the stimulus checks under the Cares Act increased economic output in the U.S. by 0.6%. In comparison, enhanced unemploymentt benefits boosted the economy by 1.1%, while the Payment Protection Program (PPP) led to an increase of 0.8%."}

Treasury and IRS are working tirelessly to make that happen,\" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Tuesday.\n\nRoughly 90% of American households will be eligible, according to an estimate from the Penn Wharton Budget Model.\n\nHere's what you need to know:\n\nHow much will you get?\n\nThe payments are worth up to $1,400 per person, including dependents. So a couple with two children could receive up to $5,600. Unlike prior rounds, families will now receive the additional money for adult dependents over the age of 17.\n\nThe full amount goes to individuals earning less than $75,000 of adjusted gross income, heads of households (like single parents) earning less than $112,500 and married couples earning less than $150,000. But then the payments gradually phase out as income goes up.\n\nDo you make too much money to be eligible?\n\nIndividuals who earn at least $80,000 a year of adjusted gross income, heads of households who earn at least $120,000 and married couples who earn at least $160,000 will be completely cut off from the third round of stimulus payments – regardless of how many children they have.\n\nOn what year are the income limits based?\n\nThe income thresholds will be based on a taxpayer's most recent return. If they've already filed a 2020 return by the time the payment is sent, the IRS will base eligibility on their 2020 adjusted gross income. If not, it will be based on the 2019 return or the information submitted through an online portal set up last year for people who don't usually file tax returns.\n\nWhen can you expect the money?\n\nPeople could start seeing the payments hit their bank accounts within days of Biden signing the bill – which is expected to happen soon after the House votes on Wednesday on the $1.9 trillion Covid relief package.\n\nFor the previous pandemic stimulus bill, the IRS started sending out the second round of payments three days after then-President Donald Trump signed that legislation in late December. But it's possible that tax filing season, which is underway, could slow down the process this time.\n\nThe payments do not all go out at once. Those whose bank information is on file with the IRS would likely get the money first, because it would be directly deposited into their accounts. Others may receive paper checks or prepaid debit cards in the mail.\n\nThe IRS is \"building on lessons learned from previous rounds to increase the households that will get electronic payments, which are substantially faster than checks,\" Psaki said.\n\nYou got the last stimulus check.

In the 8pm hour, for example, \"Anderson Cooper 360\" led with the news out of New York while MSNBC and Fox went with other stories. \"It's not clear\" if he \"can do the basic function of government and governing in this state,\" Maggie Haberman said.\n\nPer Haberman's NYT colleague Katie Glueck, \"Events could move swiftly: A person familiar with the process said it could take just a month to complete the inquiry and draw up the articles of impeachment. A trial in the State Senate could begin as soon as late September or early October.\" Details here...\n\nThe CNN angle\n\nCan Chris Cuomo continue to helm his 9pm show while being connected to one of the biggest stories in politics? CNN management said yes on Tuesday by keeping him on the air. Chris started to call his show a \"Covid command center\" last week and he kept up the theme on Tuesday, leading with the Covid case surge among the unvaccinated and interviewing Jerome Adams about it.\n\nInside CNN, some staffers I spoke with were supportive of Cuomo on Tuesday, recognizing that no one chooses their family members, and that viewers expected to see him on the air for \"Prime Time,\" one of the network's highest-rated shows. Some other staffers were, as BuzzFeed News wrote, \"highly critical of the company's decision not to discipline Chris Cuomo for his role in the scandal.\"\n\nThat's because of Chris Cuomo's role advising his brother, and even collaborating with members of his brother's senior staff, as the sexual harassment charges crested earlier this year. The Washington Post reported on this in May, and CNN publicly chastised Chris for participating in calls with the governor's staffers. Chris also publicly apologized to his colleagues at the time for putting them in a \"bad spot.\""}

(AP) — Prosecutors in Kyle Rittenhouse's murder trial may have lost their best chance at convicting the Illinois man of something when the judge threw out a charge that Rittenhouse was a minor in possession of a dangerous weapon.\n\nRittenhouse shot three men, killing two of them, with an AR-15-style rifle during a chaotic protest against police brutality in Kenosha last year. A jury deliberated about 3 1/2 days before finding Rittenhouse not guilty on Friday of five felony charges, including a murder charge that could have carried a life in prison sentence.\n\nThat jury never got to consider the gun possession charge — one that at one time had seemed a slam-dunk for the prosecution. Rittenhouse was 17 at the time, and there was no dispute that he was armed the night of the shootings with a Smith and Wesson AR-style semi-automatic rifle strapped to his chest.\n\nThough the charge was only a misdemeanor — punishable by a maximum nine months in jail — it might have offered the jury a way to convict Rittenhouse of a lesser crime if they were persuaded by his self-defense claims but agreed with prosecutors that he made a poor decision to carry a rifle on the streets of Kenosha.\n\nSo what happened?\n\nHours before closing arguments began on Monday, Judge Bruce Schroeder granted a defense motion to toss out the weapons charge. Rittenhouse attorneys Mark Richards and Corey Chirafisi pointed to an exception in the law that they said allows minors to possess shotguns and rifles as long as they're not short-barreled.\n\nAssistant District Attorney James Kraus argued that the exception renders the state's prohibition on minors possessing dangerous weapons meaningless. But when he acknowledged that Rittenhouse's rifle's barrel was longer than 16 inches, the minimum barrel length allowed under state law, Schroeder dismissed the charge.\n\nTo Kenosha-based defense attorney Michael Cicchini, the statute clearly requires a weapon to be short-barreled to apply, and the judge made the right call.\n\n\"There doesn't seem to be much ambiguity here,\" he said. \"(The charge) should have been dismissed earlier.\"\n\nThe current wording of the overarching law seems clear: \"Any person under 18 years of age who possesses or goes armed with a dangerous weapon is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor.\" A lead-in paragraph defines dangerous weapon as several things, including \"any firearm, loaded or unloaded.\"\n\nThe subsection that defense attorneys relied upon to seek dismissal reads: \"This section applies only to a person under 18 years of age who possesses or is armed with a rifle or a shotgun if the person is in violation of s. 941.28 ...\" That section of law isn't specific to minors, but rather forbids any person from having a short-barreled shotgun or rifle.\n\n\"We knew from the beginning, that if you read that statute correctly, he was legal in having that firearm,\" Richards said Friday after Rittenhouse was cleared of the remaining charges."}

Speaking at the Web Summit in Lisbon, the former Facebook employee, who has leaked tens of thousands of internal documents detailing the company's struggles with user safety and misinformation, also criticised Zuckerberg's \"unconscionable\" decision to invest in its metaverse concept instead of focusing on fixing its current problems.\n\nAsked if Zuckerberg should step down, Haugen said: \"I think Facebook will be stronger with someone who is willing to focus on safety, so yes.\"\n\nHowever, Haugen acknowledged that Zuckerberg's control of Meta was an issue for any independent shareholders who might wish for a change at the top. Zuckerberg controls decision-making at the company through his majority ownership of the voting shares in Meta, which makes his position unassailable.\n\n\"Mark holds 54% of the voting shares in Facebook. He is the chairman and the CEO and I think that at a minimum the shareholders have the right to actually choose their CEO. And so I think it is unlikely the company will change if he remains the CEO,\" said Haugen.\n\n\"And I hope that he can see that there is so much good he could do in the world, and maybe it's a chance for someone else to maybe take the reins.\"\n\nHaugen also criticised the strategic shift behind the company's surprise rebranding last week, with Zuckerberg committing the business to a major investment in the metaverse, a space where digital representations of people – avatars – interact at work and play, meeting in their office, going to concerts and even trying on clothes.\n\nHaugen said the documents she had released to Congress, regulators and the press made clear that the company needed to spend more on basic safety systems and not an expansion into virtual reality.\n\nThe documents released by Haugen have revealed that Meta was aware its Instagram photo-sharing app has been accused of exacerbating mental health problems for teenage girls, that its own workers were dismayed by a failure to stem misinformation spreading in the run-up to the 6 January riot in Washington, and that Facebook was helping to fan ethnic violence in Ethiopia.\n\n\"I think there is a meta problem at Facebook which is that over and over again Facebook chooses expansion in new areas over sticking the landing on what they have already done and I find it unconscionable that, as you read through the documents, it states very clearly there needs to be more resources on very basic safety systems,\" she said."}

Gen. William Walker, commanding general of the District of Columbia National Guard, told senators that the then-chief of the Capitol Police requested military support in a \"voice cracking with emotion\" in a 1:49 p.m. call as rioters began pushing toward the Capitol. Walker said he immediately relayed the request to the Army but did not learn until after 5 p.m. that the Defense Department had approved it. Guard troops who had been waiting on buses were then rushed to the Capitol, arriving in 18 minutes, Walker said.\n\nThe hourslong delay cost the National Guard precious minutes in the early hours of the Jan. 6 rioting, with Walker saying he could have gotten personnel into the building within 20 minutes of getting approval. As it stood, the support did not happen until the evening. The delay also stood in contrast to the swift authorization for National Guard deployment that Walker said was granted in response to the civil unrest that roiled Washington last June as an outgrowth of racial justice protests.\n\nA senior Pentagon official who testified, Robert Salesses, said then-acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller wanted to take time to understand precisely how National Guard troops would be used at the Capitol and what assignments they would be given. Mindful of criticism that the response to the demonstrations last spring was heavy-handed, military officials were also concerned about the optics of a substantial National Guard presence at the Capitol, and thought such visuals could inflame the rioters, Walker said.\n\n\"The Army senior leadership\" expressed \"that it would not be their best military advice to have uniformed Guardsmen on the Capitol,\" Walker said.\n\nThe Senate hearing was the latest in a series dedicated to the government's preparations and response as a mob of then-President Donald Trump's supporters laid siege to the Capitol. Taken together, the hearings have spelled out the challenge law enforcement officials face in sorting through an ocean of unverified tips but also highlighted how police inadequately prepared for the Trump loyalists; that FBI warnings about the threat of violence did not reach top police officials; and that requests for aid were not promptly answered.\n\n\"Anytime there's an attack, we in the FBI want to bat 1,000, and we want to not ever have this happen again,\" said Jill Sanborn, the bureau's top counterterrorism official and one of the witnesses. \"So we're asking ourselves exactly the questions that you're asking: Is there a place that we could have collected more (intelligence)? Is there something we could have done?\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Capitol Police disclosed the existence of intelligence of a \"possible plot\" by a militia group to breach the Capitol on Thursday. The revelation, coming as the acting police chief was testifying before a House subcommittee, differed from an earlier advisory from the House sergeant-at-arms that said police had no indication that any such violence was planned."}

It's potential catastrophic delays.\n\n\"Ten per cent of the world's trade goes through the Suez Canal and you average about 50 vessels a day and we're in the second day of not being able to move any vessels.\n\nSuez Canal The Suez Canal is the quickest sea route between Asia and Europe and is one of the world's most heavily used shipping lanes. On average 50 vessels per day pass along the canal, although at times the number can be much higher. The canal is 120 miles long, 672ft wide and 78ft deep meaning it can handle the world's biggest ships, which take around 11 hours to pass through. Ships have been grounded in the canal before and in 2017 a Japanese ship became stuck but was re-floated within hours. The first canal was dug under the reign of Senausret III, Pharaoh of Egypt, who reigned from 1887-1849BC. A new artificial waterway was planned by French engineer Ferdinand de Lesseps, which took 10 years to complete and opened in November 1869. Egypt nationalised the canal in 1956, prompting an invasion by shareholders Britain and France along with Israel. The Suez Crisis ended only after Egypt sank 40 ships in the canal and the United States, Soviet Union and United Nations intervened, forcing Britain, France and Israel to withdraw. The state-owned Suez Canal Authority was established in July 1956 and runs the waterway. In 2015 Egypt extended the Suez Canal providing ships with a 22 mile channel parallel channel, allowing more vessels to use it.\n\n\"Shipping companies are going to have to make a decision fairly soon whether or not to route the vessels around Africa, which adds and additional 12-14 days.\"\n\nDr Mercogliano, a former merchant mariner and associate professor of history at North Carolinas Campbell University, said the situation of a ship blocking the entire canal has never been faced before.\n\n\"There have been groundings on the Suez Canal before but never one of a ship this size or so dramatic - literally shutting the whole canal down by crossing the entire width of the canal,\" he said.\n\nHe appeared to contradict the owner's explanation for the incident that a gust of wind blew vessel of course, saying loss of power was probably to blame.\n\n\"According to the ship's agent, the ship lost power,\" he said.\n\n\"They literally said ship went 'dark' and in that scenario they would not only propulsion but also the rudder controls and it appears the vessel veered to the right and went ashore on the eastern bank.\n\n\"And because of the length of the vessel, it's one of the largest ships in the world, she's an ultra large container vessel, she actually ran aground on the eastern bank. You can see part of her bow is out of the water.\"\n\nHe said that if they ship can't immediately be re-floated then a more complex operation will begin - but that's unlikely to be quick.\n\n\"If they can't get her off with tugs they will have to start removing fuel off her and then the containers,\" he said.\n\n\"But the difficulty with getting the containers off her is that she's so tall it would be very difficult to get the correct sized cranes in there to get those off.\""}

Need help navigating the Republican primaries? Get text updates from Karen Tumulty. ArrowRight The storming of the Capitol was one of the most deplorable and shocking events in U.S. history. Never before had a mob of Americans seized the citadel of American democracy in a fit of fury. The evidence produced at former president Donald Trump's impeachment trial that showed some intended to kill Vice President Mike Pence and Pelosi demonstrated how close the event came to being catastrophically worse. We must get to the bottom of what happened and why.\n\nPelosi's proposed commission could accomplish that. The 9/11 Commission that she says this would be modeled on was genuinely bipartisan. Its five Republican and five Democratic members were distinguished former legislators and public officials whose prestige and reputations lent credibility to the investigation. It conducted months of investigations, followed the evidence where it led and produced a massive report detailing what happened and offering recommendations to prevent a similar tragedy. No such effort is immune from criticism, but the 9/11 Commission did an excellent job of putting politics behind it in pursuit of the truth.\n\nThat's exactly what's needed here. We need to know how the riot came to be and why Capitol security failed so dismally. Given the prevailing partisan passions, such an effort must be perceived by all to be interested in the truth and not in digging up nuggets of facts that would then be spun into a partisan web.\n\nThis effort should look at the role Trump and his official or campaign staff played in organizing or inspiring the rally that transformed into the riot. It should also look into what Trump knew about the riot and when, and what he did and did not do to protect the vice president, lawmakers and their staffs. We don't know what this will uncover, but it could find things that will make many Republicans unhappy and uncomfortable.\n\nBut that's not the only line of inquiry it should pursue. Did anyone — including extremists on the right — infiltrate the protesters with the intent of turning a mass rally into a violent event? Some on the right still believe antifa or other leftist extremist were involved even though the FBI discredits that notion. These possibilities should also be thoroughly investigated regardless of who might be embarrassed or what it implies for Trump's culpability.\n\nThe commission should also examine why Capitol Police failed so dismally when put to the test. It's clear that at a minimum they were understaffed, improperly equipped and poorly deployed. It's also clear that supporting forces, such as the National Guard or D.C. police, were not readily available in case the gathering exploded out of control. History would have been very different if police had held their lines and kept protesters outside the building. It's crucial to understand why such a massive and consequential failure of duty occurred and who was to blame.\n\nCommissioners themselves should include notable representatives from all political persuasions. That means at least one person should be recognized as a strong progressive while another should be a high-profile Trump supporter. It's essential that people on both political poles know that their views are included and respected during the search for truth. Anything less would mean the commission's conclusions would be rejected out of hand by important segments in both parties."}

Commissions do not affect our editors' opinions or evaluations.\n\nNow that the third round of pandemic relief stimulus checks has been long spent, you might wonder if there's any potential for a fourth round of payments.\n\nIn short, no. However, a few states have opted to issue payments of their own.\n\nLawmakers instead are focusing on other measures to provide financial support, like child tax credit payments.\n\nDirect payments and other pandemic relief programs have been shown to curb housing and food insecurity during the pandemic. Without them, it's likely the economic recovery after the early pandemic recession in spring 2020 would move even slower than the gradual progress it's been making for the last year and a half.\n\nBut although some members of Congress have previously called for additional aid for households still weathering the financial effects of the pandemic, there have not been meaningful discussions at the federal level about issuing another round of checks.\n\nWhat States Are Sending New Stimulus Checks?\n\nMany states have either sent, or are sending, stimulus checks to qualifying residents.\n\nCalifornia\n\nIn July, California announced the Golden Gate Stimulus deal to provide a payment to 5.7 million people. Taxpayers earning between $30,000 and $75,000 per year can receive one-time payments of $600, and households with dependents can receive an additional $500. Distribution of those payments began in September.\n\nNew York\n\nIn April, New York started offering one-time payments of up to $15,000 for undocumented immigrants who couldn't work due to the pandemic. Applications are considered in the order received, and the state has cautioned that the fund is nearly empty.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nNew Mexico announced one-time payments of $750 to more than 4,000 low-income households that didn't receive federal stimulus payments. Applications for this program are no longer accepted, and payments were issued in early August.\n\nMaryland\n\nIn Maryland, taxpayers with qualifying income could receive up to $500.

Some teachers in Georgia and Florida received payments in 2021; in Minnesota, those receiving bonus checks included grocery store workers and medical center staffers.\n\nIn some cases, additional direct payments have come from state budgets: California's, for one, was funded by a surplus in state income tax revenue. Other state programs have used federal pandemic aid to distribute money to residents directly.\n\nIs Congress Calling for a Fourth Stimulus Payment?\n\nDiscussion on Capitol Hill about issuing additional stimulus payments has quieted since the spring.\n\nIn late March, a group of more than 20 Democratic senators signed a letter to Biden asking for additional aid for Americans. The group recommended recurring direct payments instead of a one-time check."}

The speed, and Wood's failure to handle a curve, led to the crash, the sheriff said.\n\nThe powerful collision, at a bend on Hawthorne Boulevard near Blackhorse Road on the Palos Verdes Peninsula at around 7:15 a.m. Feb. 23, launched the the car into the air.\n\nThe SUV went spinning until coming to a rest several hundred feet away, sheriff's Capt. James Powers said.\n\n\"The impact of the vehicle when it hit the tree caused the vehicle to go airborne, and do a somewhat pirouette, landing on its side,\" Powers said.\n\nThe data recorder indicates Woods never hit his brakes as he drifted toward the median, but detectives believe he \"inadvertently hit the accelerator\" as he tried to brake, the sheriff's captain said. Woods was cooperative with investigators but told them he doesn't recall the collision, sheriff's officials said.\n\nA seat-belted Woods was trapped inside until firefighters and paramedics pulled him out through the windshield.\n\nHawthorne Boulevard's downward stretch is known for bad accidents. Neighbors have described the sloping, curvy stretch of roadway as notorious for crashes, especially among those not from the area. It is not uncommon for drivers to travel in excess of 80 mph there.\n\nWoods was the only person in the vehicle. Villanueva said he was not cited for an infraction, nor was he charged with a crime.\n\nThe sheriff repeated on Wednesday that there was no sign the 45-year-old Woods was impaired. After he was rescued from the vehicle, Woods had help sitting up from deputies. Despite suffering significant injuries, he was alert, Powers said.\n\nWoods has famously been involved in at least two other incidents on the road involving apparent impairment, both times in Florida: In 2009 he was found unconscious in his car after a crash and later admitted to taking Ambien; eight years later he was arrested and pleaded guilty to reckless driving after a toxicology report found multiple prescription drugs in his system.\n\nIn the Rolling Hills Estates crash, no law enforcement officer witnessed what happened, so Woods could not be cited for speeding, the sheriff said. And without probable cause that Woods was impaired or distracted, the sheriff said, investigators could not seek a blood-alcohol test or try to obtain a search warrant for calls made or received on his cell phone.\n\n\"Past history does not get you the elements you need for probable cause,\" said Villaneuva, adding Woods was treated the same as anyone else would have been. \"I'll leave it at that.\""}

This decision was based on the evidence presented to the TAG-VE that Omicron has several mutations that may have an impact on how it behaves, for example, on how easily it spreads or the severity of illness it causes. Here is a summary of what is currently known.\n\nCurrent knowledge about Omicron\n\nResearchers in South Africa and around the world are conducting studies to better understand many aspects of Omicron and will continue to share the findings of these studies as they become available.\n\nTransmissibility: It is not yet clear whether Omicron is more transmissible (e.g., more easily spread from person to person) compared to other variants, including Delta. The number of people testing positive has risen in areas of South Africa affected by this variant, but epidemiologic studies are underway to understand if it is because of Omicron or other factors.\n\nSeverity of disease: It is not yet clear whether infection with Omicron causes more severe disease compared to infections with other variants, including Delta. Preliminary data suggests that there are increasing rates of hospitalization in South Africa, but this may be due to increasing overall numbers of people becoming infected, rather than a result of specific infection with Omicron. There is currently no information to suggest that symptoms associated with Omicron are different from those from other variants. Initial reported infections were among university students—younger individuals who tend to have more mild disease—but understanding the level of severity of the Omicron variant will take days to several weeks. All variants of COVID-19, including the Delta variant that is dominant worldwide, can cause severe disease or death, in particular for the most vulnerable people, and thus prevention is always key.\n\nEffectiveness of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection\n\nPreliminary evidence suggests there may be an increased risk of reinfection with Omicron (ie, people who have previously had COVID-19 could become reinfected more easily with Omicron), as compared to other variants of concern, but information is limited. More information on this will become available in the coming days and weeks.\n\nEffectiveness of vaccines: WHO is working with technical partners to understand the potential impact of this variant on our existing countermeasures, including vaccines. Vaccines remain critical to reducing severe disease and death, including against the dominant circulating variant, Delta. Current vaccines remain effective against severe disease and death.\n\nEffectiveness of current tests: The widely used PCR tests continue to detect infection, including infection with Omicron, as we have seen with other variants as well. Studies are ongoing to determine whether there is any impact on other types of tests, including rapid antigen detection tests.\n\nEffectiveness of current treatments: Corticosteroids and IL6 Receptor Blockers will still be effective for managing patients with severe COVID-19. Other treatments will be assessed to see if they are still as effective given the changes to parts of the virus in the Omicron variant.\n\nStudies underway\n\nAt the present time, WHO is coordinating with a large number of researchers around the world to better understand Omicron. Studies currently underway or underway shortly include assessments of transmissibility, severity of infection (including symptoms), performance of vaccines and diagnostic tests, and effectiveness of treatments."}

So I went over to Tiger's house a few weeks ago to see him, and in his family room he's got his trophy cabinet and it's his 15 major trophies. I said, 'That's really cool.

But does that mean non-citizens who reside in the United States will receive the check?\n\nIn some cases, yes. Anyone who pays taxes in the United States as a resident is eligible for a stimulus payment. The American Rescue Plan has specific eligibility requirements for who can receive a stimulus check.

A statement by the Suez Canal Authority initially blamed the incident on high winds and a sand storm that reduced visibility, but later said that strong winds were \"not the only cause,\" and that an investigation was ongoing.\n\nThere is no clear indication at this point that climate change played a role in the sandstorm that led to the ship's blocking the canal, but the incident raises intriguing questions that likely will prompt research into any correlation.\n\nThe multi-day shutdown of one of the world's busiest shipping chokepoints underscores the vulnerability of the global food system and economy to disruptions. That vulnerability is playing on the stage of increasingly extreme weather, rising seas, and an increasingly just-in-time world of shipping.\n\nFigure 1. MODIS satellite image from March 23, 2021, the day of the grounding of the container ship Ever Given in the Suez Canal. A cold front over Egypt was causing a widespread dust storm that affected the Red Sea, Suez Canal, and waters of the Mediterranean Sea. (Image credit: NASA Worldview)\n\nMeteorology of the event\n\nThe high winds and sand storm that contributed to the grounding incident were caused by a cold front trailing to the south of a low-pressure system centered near southern Turkey.\n\nAs the cold front swept eastwards across Egypt on March 23, powerful winds of 25-30 knots (29-35 mph) blew along the axis of the Red Sea from the south-southeast, into the southern end of the Suez Canal, as seen in the 6 UTC analysis from the GFS model (Figure 2). The Ever Given became stuck at 05:40 UTC that day. According to the GFS analysis, a sharp wind shift, with winds blowing out of the southwest to west, was present near the spot where the Ever Given blocked the canal, about five miles north of its connection with the Red Sea."}

Rating: About this rating False\n\nIn early April 2021, a seemingly endless number of social media users copied and pasted a purported breaking news story about the ship that was famously stuck for days in the Suez Canal. Most of the posts began with the same sentence: \"Over a thousand trafficked children and dead bodies have been rescued out of shipping containers in the Suez Canal by US Navy Seals.\" The story referenced the Evergreen cargo ship Ever Given, which became stuck in the Suez Canal in March and caused a major maritime traffic jam that took days to clear after the ship was freed.\n\nThe source of the text appeared to be Before It's News, a dubious website that has consistently published content not rooted in facts. For example, the unreliable website once falsely claimed Pope Francis had been found guilty of child trafficking and murder.\n\nRegarding the Ever Given ship and the purported U.S. Navy SEALs rescue, the full story on Before It's News bore the headline: \"Trafficked Children, Bodies, Weapons Found on Evergreen Ship Blocking Suez Canal.\" In addition to being posted on Facebook, the misleading content was also shared on TikTok.\n\nThe introduction of the article read as follows:\n\nOver a thousand trafficked children and dead bodies have been rescued out of shipping containers in the Suez Canal by US Navy Seals. Sources say that as of this writing, children were still being rescued and bodies discovered in Evergreen's 18,000+ containers. The containers were on an Evergreen Corporation ship that blocked the Canal from Tues. 23 March to Mon 29 March, causing billions in lost revenue to shipping companies internationally. The Seals also found Weapons of Mass Destruction on the six story high vessel – which were believed destined to start a war in the Middle East. Finally by Tues. the Evergreen cargo ship was loosened and taken to Bitter Lake in Egypt. By order of the Egyptian President, the containers were taken off the ship and searched by US Navy Seals. The Japanese-owned, Taiwanese-operated ship of Evergreen Corporation was actually co-owned by Walmart and the Clinton Foundation – known for it's international child trafficking ring. The children were said ordered out of magazines like Wayfair by pedophiles who paid big bucks for certain abused children.\n\nThe rest of the article mentioned \"weapons of mass destruction\" and included a purported \"telegram\" that read: \"Ever Given has been boarded by the US Navy Seals and they have opened several cargo containers with live and dead inside. The vessel is in Bitter Lake and the Navy is performing unloading procedures. No images will be leaked, but I have been sent one.\"\n\nThe entire story was false.\n\nOne Facebook user who shared the baseless article posted: \"YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS STUFF UP!!\" That was also false.\n\nNot one credible news publisher across the world reported anything similar. If such a story had any basis in fact, it is unlikely that coverage of the massive breaking news event would be limited to a single obscure website that had a history of publishing false and misleading content.\n\nThe mention of the Clinton Foundation in the story might remind readers of a somewhat similar, debunked claim involving former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Ever Given cargo ship."}

After the round he told reporters about his Masters Week, which included a visit to Woods' home, just minutes away from Fowler's on Jupiter Island.\n\nThe visit marked the first time Fowler had seen Woods since Woods' February car crash, which left him in a hospital bed for weeks before he was able to return home.\n\n\"Between that and the British Open, those are two tournaments that I love to watch,\" Fowler said of the Masters. \"Typically I'm in them and I'm watching either the morning or afternoon wave when I'm not playing, so it was a little difference in that sense, being at home.\"\n\nFowler acknowledged that both he and Woods were disappointed not to be playing the event, but he still got plenty out of the experience.

Justin Thomas had gone by several times, and Rory McIlroy had stopped in to see him, too. Both were encouraged by his condition.\n\n\"One thing JT told me, he went over pretty much after [Woods] got back from L.A. and JT told me, 'Honestly, he was a lot better than I expected.' So that was good to hear.\"\n\nWhen Thomas first went to visit, Woods had to keep his leg elevated to keep the inflammation down. But Woods has since posted a photo on crutches with his dog and other photos have emerged where he's riding in a golf cart, following his son Charlie on the course.\n\n\"It was good to see him,\" Fowler said. \"Hung out and spent some time with Charlie and [Woods' daughter] Sam was there for a little bit before she had to go to soccer practice.\"\n\nFowler made it clear that Woods is focused on the big things.\n\n\"I think his main focus and concern is getting back to being a dad, go play golf with Charlie, push him around and be able to run around with Sam.\"\n\nThe photos — and reports from Woods' friends — are encouraging developments given the severity of his accident. It was just a couple months ago that players were wearing red and black on Sunday at the WGC-Concession to let Woods know they were thinking of him as he recovered post-surgery. Subsequent reports have only made it that much more clear that Woods was fortunate to escape the crash.\n\n\"Getting to be around him on a bit more of a personal level and getting to know him, especially over the last really five, six years, you know, we try and push him as hard as we can, but at the same time it's still pretty cool to get to go hang out and spend time with Tiger,\" Fowler said."}

Liz Cheney as their No. 3 leader and saying they'd fight a Democratic push to kick Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene off her committees.\n\nCongresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has shown support on social media for calls to violence against Democrats and a range of conspiracy theories. Her Twitter account was suspended in January after she repeated allegations of fraud in the US presidential election\n\nIn a 145-61 vote by secret ballot, House Republicans overwhelmingly rebuffed a rebellion by hard-right conservatives to toss Cheney, R-Wyo., over her vote last month to impeach then-President Donald Trump.\n\nMinority Leader Kevin McCarthy ridiculed Democrats for slating a House vote on Thursday that would remove Greene from her committees. McCarthy's comment was a signal that he was dismissing bipartisan demands that the hard-right Georgia Republican be punished for her online embrace of racist and violent views and bizarre conspiracy theories.\n\nThe decisions over Greene and Cheney have subjected the GOP to a politically agonizing test of its direction as it moves beyond the Trump presidency. Since he grudgingly vacated the White House last month, the party has been ideologically adrift as it's struggled over whether to embrace his norm-busting divisiveness or the party's more traditional, policy-oriented conservative values.\n\nBut shortly after the Democratic-led House Rules Committee cleared the way for Thursday's vote, McCarthy released a statement saying Democrats were \"choosing to raise the temperature\" by attempting a \"partisan power grab.\"\n\nMcCarthy condemned Greene's past endorsements of conspiracy theories — after weeks of saying little critical of her — and said the first-term congresswoman had recognized in a private conversation that she must meet \"a higher standard\" as a lawmaker. Greene has shown support for calls to violence against Democrats and bizarre fictions about faked school shootings.\n\n\"I hold her to her word, as well as her actions going forward,\" McCarthy said.\n\n00:30\n\nCheney is a daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney and a fixture of the party establishment. She was among just 10 House Republicans to vote to impeach Trump last month.\n\n\"I won't apologize for the vote,\" Cheney told her colleagues in the closed-door session, according to a person familiar with the session who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private meeting.\n\nDuring a break in that closed-door session, McCarthy told reporters he'd defended Cheney inside.\n\n\"People can have differences of opinion. That's what you can have a discussion about. Liz has a right to vote her conscience,\" said McCarthy, who'd previously given no clear signal about whether he'd support his lieutenant.\n\nAt the earlier Rules Committee meeting, Chair Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said lawmakers would send \"an awful message\" if they took no action on Greene. \"If this is not the bottom, I don't know what the hell is,\" McGovern said.\n\nMcCarthy tried to push blame onto Democrats, criticizing them for taking no action against their own lawmakers whom he didn't name, including one he said \"spread anti-Semitic tropes.\" Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., made comments critical of Israel in 2019 and apologized.\n\nThe internal GOP fight over how to handle Greene and Cheney underscored the hold Trump and his voters still have on much of the party. But it's not uniform.\n\nAround two-thirds of House Republicans voted to back Trump's effort to overturn his November election loss — just hours after his supporters' deadly storming of the Capitol that led to his impeachment for inciting insurrection. Yet Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and other GOP senators have lambasted Greene, reflecting worries that her wing of the party cannot win statewide Senate races.\n\nHouse Republicans had faced bipartisan pressure to punish Greene, including from McConnell. A House vote was expected to be a political ordeal for many Republicans, forcing them to go on record defending or punishing the unapologetic, social media-savvy Greene.\n\nShe burst onto the national political scene after just a month in office and with enthusiastic support from Trump. Even during the effort to punish her, she has lashed out at Democrats and raised money on the controversy.\n\nRepublicans appointed Greene to the Education and Labor Committee, a decision that drew especially harsh criticism because of her suggestions that mass school shootings in Connecticut and Florida could be hoaxes. Greene is also on the Budget Committee.\n\nMcCarthy said Democrats turned down his offer to move Greene onto the House Small Business Committee instead."}

Binge attempted to get the bond arrangement for Rittenhouse changed after he was spotted drinking at a bar soon after he pleaded not guilty to the charges against him on January 5.\n\nRittenhouse is accused of killing two people and injuring one other during Black Lives Matter protests in Kenosha in August 2020. His defense team said the suspect, aged 17 at the time, attended the protests to protect the city and provide medical care to those injured during the unrest, following the shooting of Black man Jacob Blake by police.\n\nThe court documents state that while Rittenhouse was at Pudgy's Pub in Mount Pleasant with his mother and several other people, he was \"serenaded\" by a group of adults singing a song written for the 1992 Disney film Aladdin which the far-right Proud Boys group use as an \"anthem and for self-identification.\"\n\nThe prosecutors also said that Rittenhouse posed for pictures at the bar while flashing the OK hand gesture—a previously innocuous symbol that has been co-opted by some on the far-right as a coded message to show support for white supremacy.\n\nBinge applied in a state motion to have Rittenhouse's bond modified to state he is prohibited from consuming alcohol or being present in any establishment where alcohol is served, as well as associating himself with any \"white power/white supremacist groups or organizations\" such as the Proud Boys or making public displays of any \"white power\" signs.\n\nResponding to the state motion, defense attorney Mark Richards said that Rittenhouse does not object to his bond being modified to prohibit him from drinking alcohol while denying he has any links to the Proud Boys or other far-right groups.\n\n\"The State has done an extensive search of all of Mr Rittenhouse's social media as part of its investigation in this case,\" Richards wrote. \"Upon information and belief, no information linking Mr Rittenhouse to the listed organizations has been found.\n\n\"Additionally, the State has presented no evidence of Mr Rittenhouse visiting any of the listed organizations' websites.\n\n\"The State's bond motion is a not-so-thinly veiled attempt to interject the issue of race into a case that is about a person's right to self-defense.\""}

Some of Trump's supporters were armed and ready for war: an Alabama man allegedly parked a pickup truck with 11 homemade bombs, an assault rifle and a handgun two blocks from the Capitol hours before authorities discovered it, according to federal prosecutors. Another man allegedly showed up with an assault rifle and hundreds of rounds of ammunition, telling acquaintances he wanted to shoot or run over House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Pipe bombs were found near the headquarters of the Republican National Committee and the Democratic National Committee as authorities tried to dispel the mob and secure the Capitol.\n\nBut three days later, Trump appears no more aware of the consequences of his actions than on the day of the riot when he delighted in the mayhem. Bunkered at the White House with an ever-shrinking circle of aides, he has offered no remorse for inciting the crowd and offered only a forced denunciation of their actions. Aides, weary and disgusted, refuse to come near him. His central line to the outside world, Twitter, was severed Friday night. People who admired him, worked for him and followed him down dark paths before now say he has crossed into a delusional place, entirely detached from reality."}

The caller reported seeing flames coming out of a window.\n\nWhen firefighters arrived, at least one of the home's occupants had made it outside, Truesdell said. That person told firefighters that five people were still inside.\n\nTwo people were reported dead at the scene, and one person was taken to a hospital with critical, possibly life-threatening injuries. Three others were injured in the fire, medics said.\n\nListen to the Statesman's news podcast: The best local news, 8 minutes a day\n\nThe home is considered a total loss and investigators are still working to determine the fire's cause, Truesdell said.\n\n\"We are aware of reports that it might have been attributed to some sort of indoor warming fire, but we won't have a final official cause for a while,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Austin Energy's outage map, the home was without power at the time of the fire. The area the home is in has been without power since around 2 a.m. Monday, according to the outage map.\n\nAs power outages are expected to continue through at least Wednesday night, Truesdell said Austinites should be careful about how they're seeking to warm up.\n\n\"Unfortunately, with the prolonged power outages, people are taking some pretty serious risks. We're trying to get the message out to remind people that there's a lot of dangers with starting fires indoors,\" he said.\n\nMany fires in Austin and Travis County were reported this week as residents tried to heat their homes with propane, charcoal and other methods. Some fires were also started by fireplaces or faulty heating units.\n\nFirefighters and medics on Wednesday urged Travis County residents to avoid trying to heat their homes with methods that could lead to poisonings and death.\n\nStarting a fire by bringing a charcoal barbecue pit inside or using a gas grill inside could lead to a structure fire or carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\nIf people go to sleep with fires from items like a barbecue pit or gas grill, the danger is they won't wake up, officials have said.\n\n\"Once the fire starts, they don't have the wherewithal to wake up,\" Truesdell said.\n\nAustin-Travis County EMS Captain Darren Noak on Wednesday said medics and firefighters have worked around the clock to respond to thousands of emergencies in Travis County since the severe winter weather began.\n\nDozens of those calls were from Austin-Travis County residents who were injured after slipping on icy pavement, while many others included such emergencies as carbon monoxide poisoning, vehicle crashes and fires.\n\nMedics say a person died from a cardiac arrest Monday afternoon at the camp that Gov. Greg Abbott set up for people experiencing homelessness near U.S. 183 and Texas 71. It is unclear whether the death was related to the cold weather, they said.\n\nSome rumors spread across social media Tuesday saying bodies were found outside in the snow after temperatures dipped below 10 degrees overnight. However, EMS and Austin fire officials said they have not responded to any such calls.\n\nNoak said if bodies are located in homes or outside in the Austin area, first responders can't immediately link those deaths to cold weather. It's the job of local medical examiners to determine how a person died, which is a process that could take weeks.\n\nAustin firefighters and medics said Wednesday there didn't appear to be more calls about fatalities than normal.\n\nMore than two dozen people across the country have died in the extreme weather this week, some while struggling to find warmth inside their homes."}

The jurors deliberated for more than 10 hours over two days before coming to their decision.\n\nWearing a mask inside the Hennepin County Courthouse in Minneapolis, Chauvin had no apparent reaction to the guilty verdict. Afterward, his bail was revoked and he was placed in handcuffs and removed from the court through a side door.\n\nHe was taken to a facility in Stillwater, Minnesota, about 25 miles east of downtown Minneapolis, officials said.\n\nThe second-degree murder charge said Chauvin assaulted Floyd with his knee, which unintentionally caused Floyd's death. The third-degree murder charge said Chauvin acted with a \"depraved mind,\" and the manslaughter charge said his \"culpable negligence\" caused Floyd's death.\n\nChauvin could face up to 40 years in prison for second-degree murder, up to 25 years for third-degree murder and up to 10 years for manslaughter.

Tech is not your friend. We are. ArrowRight The Google-owned video site was the last of the major social media networks to suspend Trump after the attack on the U.S. Capitol. It said it removed a video uploaded Tuesday for violating its policies and \"in light of concerns about the ongoing potential for violence.\"\n\nYouTube wouldn't confirm which video broke its rules, but a review of archived versions of its site suggests it was a clip from a news conference Trump gave to reporters where he said his comments to supporters before the Capitol attack were \"totally appropriate.\"\n\nIn the same clip, which is available on C-SPAN, Trump said social media companies were making a \"catastrophic mistake\" and doing a \"horrible thing for our country\" by penalizing him.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment. On Wednesday, the White House Twitter account shared a video statement from Trump. He didn't directly address tech companies, but he hinted at the issue with a jab at the \"unprecedented assault on free speech we have seen in recent days.\"\n\n\"These are tense and difficult times,\" he said in an uncharacteristically calm statement. \"The efforts to censor, cancel and blacklist our fellow citizens are wrong and they are dangerous. What is needed now is for us to listen to one another, not to silence one another.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Facebook said it would cut the president off indefinitely, \"for at least the next two weeks.\" Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg later told Reuters that the company had no plans to reinstate the president's account. YouTube took down one video from the president's account.

The newly formed Alphabet Workers Union, a collection of Google employees and contractors, put out a statement saying YouTube's actions in taking down just one video were \"lackluster, demonstrating a continued policy of selective and insufficient enforcement of its guidelines.\"\n\nYouTube has a three-strike process when deciding which channels to take down, which directly affects the speed at which it moves. Facebook also has a strike system, but big, complex decisions often roll up directly to Sandberg and CEO Mark Zuckerberg. At Twitter, decisions are made by the company's policy team and signed off on by CEO Jack Dorsey.\n\nYouTube's process can seem \"frustratingly slow,\" but the company actually has more of a thought-out process than Twitter and Facebook, said Jim Steyer, CEO and founder of Common Sense Media, which advocates for safer technology for children. The suspension of Trump is a positive first step, but the ban should be made permanent, he said.\n\n\"I think all the platforms missed this one,\" Steyer said, saying they should have acted earlier to crack down on misinformation Trump shared.\n\nIt's not the first time YouTube specifically has come under fire for moving too slowly."}

And the mighty vessel's fate has crucial lessons for everyone who depends on shipping. That's every single one of us.\n\nFor six days earlier this year, the world's eyes were on the Suez Canal when the Ever Given—a member of the class of so-called ultra-large container vessels (ULCVs)—got stuck in the narrow waterway. For those six intense days, rescue crews dug, drilled, and pulled while the world watched the spectacle with intense fascination. And the Ever Given's fate mattered far beyond cybergawkers' sudden interest in massive container ships in distress: It mattered because every day the Ever Given blocked the canal, dozens of ships carrying billions of dollars' worth of cargo had to wait to enter the waterway.\n\nThe resulting supply chain delays are still reverberating months after the incident. After finally being dislodged, the Ever Given was pulled by several tugboats to the adjoining Great Bitter Lake, where a new crew of Indian seafarers took over. The retrieval crew that arrived in the Great Bitter Lake was led by Capt. Hanse Kurisinkal, a highly experienced Indian officer who has worked on ULCVs pretty much since they entered the seas.\n\nGlobal supply chain delays are still reverberating months after the ship got stuck in the Suez Canal.\n\nBoth Kurisinkal's crew and the crew they replaced were fortunate that the Ever Given has a reputable owner and a similarly reputable management company. In many other cases, crews of cargo ships stuck in ports or even offshore for various reasons are simply abandoned by the ship's owner. As I've previously reported in Foreign Policy, every year dozens of crews are left on their ships—without fuel, food, and even water—for months, sometimes even years, relying on charities and seafarer unions for their survival.\n\nUntil July, when Egyptian authorities and the Ever Given's insurer finally agreed on an undisclosed compensation payment for the rescue operation, the Ever Given and its new crew couldn't go anywhere. Their departure that day generated considerable press coverage—but since then, virtually nothing has been heard from the ill-fated ship.

I sincerely apologize to my colleagues, constituents and friends for the pain I caused,\" he said. \"I recognize the horrible historical context of these words and have started to reach out to my colleagues personally to express that I understand the harm caused.

Graham began his NFL coaching career in New England from 2009-15, a stretch in which Brady and the Patriots won the AFC East title all seven seasons, the conference championship twice and Super Bowl XLIX.\n\nGiven that experience, Graham was asked if it would have been more advantageous for the Giants had Brady thrown five touchdowns in a victory last week and not entered this game looking to make amends for an unsatisfactory performance in an unexpected defeat. Graham's response was, in essence: no way.\n\n\"I was around him for seven years, every week is different for him,\" Graham said. \"I don't know anybody that's more competitive, more serious about the game and, on top of that, he's a great person. I mean, if they won by 20 touchdowns or if they lost, it doesn't matter. If he's playing the New York Giants on Monday night, that's where his focus is and it's laser focus. If you had a chance to be around him, it's laser focus, truly. To be around one of the best to ever play the game and just see that focus – I mean, I remember practicing against him – it just makes you have to raise your level as a coach because he'll take advantage. If you don't have it fixed, he's going to take advantage of it. I don't think that will play into it at all really, not with him at all, I don't think so.\"\n\nWhen these teams met last season on a Monday night in MetLife Stadium, the Buccaneers had won two in a row and five of their previous six games. The Giants jumped out to a 14-6 halftime lead. But Brady threw second-half touchdowns to Ron Gronkowski and Mike Evans and when the Giants came up short on a late two-point conversion attempt, Tampa Bay won, 25-23.\n\n\"Tom's going to figure it out,\" Graham said. \"I mean, you look back at the tape to try to have a reference point because, again, most of their offense is the same offense. They're the only team in the league to come back with all 22 starters. There are some different pieces, so you look back to have a reference point there, but each game is so different and Tom, B.A. (coach Bruce Arians), and (offensive coordinator Byron) Leftwich, they're all treating it as it's a different game."}

This impeachment, unlike his first, was bipartisan. All told, 10 Republican representatives cast their vote to impeach Trump.\n\nThis vote makes Wednesday's impeachment the most bipartisan impeachment of all time.\n\nTo be clear, 197 Republicans still voted against impeaching Trump. That shouldn't be too surprising, as only about 15% of Republicans nationally want Trump to leave office before his term is up next week.\n\nStill, the fact that so many Republicans got behind removing Trump from office is historic.\n\nOnly three other impeachments have ever taken place. They all tell a similar story: impeachments are almost always down the party-line affairs.\n\nDuring the impeachment of Democrat Andrew Johnson in 1868, no Democrats voted to impeach him.\n\nJust five House Democrats voted to impeach Democrat Bill Clinton in 1998.\n\nAnd finally, no Republicans voted to impeach Trump in 2019.\n\nWhat makes the Trump vote even more amazing is that we're at a very high level of polarization right now. The Democrats who abandoned Clinton were all moderate Democrats. Two (Virgil Goode and Ralph Hall) would eventually switch parties and serve as Republicans.\n\nThere are very few moderate House Republicans right now. Rep. Liz Cheney and Rep. Tom Rice, who voted for impeachment, are certainly not what most objective observers would consider moderate.\n\nThe relatively high number of Republican defectors comes at a time when Trump's job approval rating with Republicans has dropped below 80% (though it is still well above 70%).\n\nFrom a statistical angle, it would have been unexpected if more Republicans went against Trump. Trump may be in a valley of Republican support, but he's still got a lot of it.\n\nMost Republicans hail from safe districts where there is a far greater chance of losing a primary than a general election. Two of the Republicans who voted yes (Rep. Don Newhouse and Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler) hail from Washington state, where there is the untraditional top-two primary system in which all the candidates regardless of party run against each other.\n\nThe only historical parallel to what happened on Wednesday is the abandoned impeachment of Republican President Richard Nixon in 1974. Nixon stepped down before the House could impeach him.\n\nAlthough no formal impeachment vote took place involving the entire House, seven of the 17 House Republicans on the Judiciary Committee voted for at least one article of impeachment against Nixon in July 1974. Keep in mind, there were a lot more moderate Republicans in the House in 1974.\n\nPerhaps as interesting as the divide within the Republican ranks is the uniformity within the Democratic ranks.\n\nNot a single Democrat voted against impeaching Trump. That's a record for an impeachment.\n\nIn 1868, an Independent Republican and Conservative Republican voted against impeaching Johnson.\n\nIn 1998, four Republicans voted against all the articles to impeach Clinton.\n\nAnd when it came to Trump's last impeachment, two Democrats voted against both articles and one voted present for both.\n\nThe fact that Democrats are unified makes a lot of sense. Neither of the Democrats who voted against impeaching Trump last time are still sitting Democratic members of Congress. One of those Democrats is now a Republican (Rep. Jeff Van Drew) and the other (Collin Peterson) lost re-election last fall. The member who voted present (Tulsi Gabbard) is no longer in Congress.\n\nFurther, the Democratic caucus is smaller than it was last go around with fewer moderate members overall.\n\nOf course, impeachment is just the first step in a two-step process.\n\nThe big question going forward is whether the Senate partisan divide mirrors that of the House. If it does, there will be a lot of votes against Trump – but still not enough to convict."}

Of the 12 jurors, six were White, four were Black and two were multiracial, according to information released by the court.\n\nTwo other White women selected as alternates in the case were dismissed by the judge prior to deliberations.\n\nThe jury selection process began March 9 at the Hennepin County Government Center and wrapped up March 23, exactly two weeks later.\n\nFloyd, a 46-year-old Black man, died on May 25, 2020, after Chauvin, a White former Minneapolis Police officer, kept his knee on Floyd's neck for 9 minutes and 29 seconds while Floyd pleaded, \"I can't breathe.\" His final moments were captured on video, and his death led to widespread protests against police brutality and racism under the banner Black Lives Matter as well as incidents of unrest and looting.\n\nChauvin had pleaded not guilty to second-degree unintentional murder and second-degree manslaughter charges. He had also pleaded not guilty to third-degree murder, which was reinstated in the case on March 11.\n\nChauvin could face up to 40 years in prison for second-degree murder, up to 25 years for third-degree murder, and up to 10 years for second-degree manslaughter.\n\nSentencing is set for eight weeks from now, Judge Peter Cahill said.

In court, each person was sworn in and then questioned one by one in a process known as voir dire. The juror's name, address and other information are kept anonymous.\n\nEric Nelson questioned the prospective jurors for the defense, while Steve Schleicher questioned them for the prosecution.\n\nThe first juror selected was a White man in his 20s or 30s who works as a chemist and said he has an analytical mind.\n\nThe second juror was a woman of mixed race who appeared to be in her 20s or 30s, according to a pool reporter's observations in court. She said she was \"super excited\" about getting the jury questionnaire form.\n\nThe third juror selected was a White man in his 30s who works as an auditor. He said he supports Black Lives Matter in the general context but doesn't like everything they have done.\n\nThe fourth juror selected was a Black man in his 30s or 40s who moved to the United States 14 years ago and works in information technology. He said he had a \"somewhat negative\" opinion of Chauvin, that he strongly disagreed with defunding the police and that police make him feel safe."}

Four students were killed and seven people were wounded last month during the Oxford shooting rampage.\n\nIn Waterford, about 20 miles from Oxford High School, Police Chief Scott Underwood said his officers investigated three reports of threats by students and took four children into custody, including two from an elementary school.\n\nJust 5 minutes: A gunman turned a normal day at Oxford High into a nightmare\n\nA statement from Underwood said two 9-year-old students had a \"'naughty/nice' list with several names on each, as well as the words 'alive' and 'dead' on each side of the lists.\" They were taken to police headquarters and later turned over to their parents, with juvenile petitions to be submitted to the Oakland County Prosecutor's Office to consider charges, the statement said.\n\nAn eighth-grade student told another student that he brought a gun to school and mimicked shooting the gun with his hand, the statement said.

And in a particularly noteworthy moment, Biden cited a \"rise of political extremism, white supremacy, [and] domestic terrorism that we must confront and we will defeat.\"\n\nBiden is not the first US president to discuss racism in his inaugural address. In Barack Obama's first speech as president, he observed that \"a man whose father less than 60 years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath.\" President George W. Bush in 2005 and president Bill Clinton in 1997 both acknowledged the persistence of racism in the US.\n\nBut Biden is the first to specifically acknowledge the existence of white supremacy. That's an important sign of the way that the popular understanding of racism in the US has evolved in recent years, and of how Biden may approach racial inequality in office.\n\nAs the New York Times explained last fall, for the past few decades, the American mainstream media was more likely to reserve the phrase \"white supremacy\" to describe Nazis or the Ku Klux Klan—hate groups that claimed their own bigotry and had an explicit agenda to kill and/or oppress people of color and Jewish people.\n\nBut over the past 10 years, influential people like writer Ta-Nehisi Coates and activist-athlete Colin Kaepernick have helped to not only popularize the term, but to broaden its application to refer not only to those who explicitly embrace white supremacy. In the current parlance—and particularly in the wake of the widespread discussions about racism that began last summer—white supremacy is understood as a force enacted through systems and institutions that benefits white people while oppressing non-white people, evident in everything from the US legal system to the way corporations hire.\n\nWhite supremacy is particularly useful as a term that encapsulates the ways racism can be reinforced independently of individual prejudice. \"People have this misconception that [white supremacy] has something to do with hate or racial animus, and it doesn't,\" journalist Michael Harriott explained in an interview last summer. The fact that majority-white schools have more funding than majority-Black schools, or that Black people are disproportionately more likely to be shot and killed by police, are illustrations of white supremacy in action."}

This alert provides a brief overview of the content and timing of the principal initiatives, and previews certain objections likely to be raised in legal challenges that some governors and others have said they will file.\n\nOSHA rule requiring all employers with 100+ employees to ensure their workers are vaccinated or tested weekly, and to pay for vaccination time.\n\nThe President announced that the Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is developing an Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) that will require all employers with 100 or more employees to ensure that their workforce is fully vaccinated or to require any workers who remain unvaccinated to produce a negative test result at least weekly before coming to work. The rule—which is expected to issue within weeks—will require employers with more than 100 employees to provide paid time off for the time it takes for workers to get vaccinated and to recuperate if they experience serious side effects from the vaccination.\n\nOSHA ETS's are authorized by statute, which permits the Secretary of Labor to promulgate an ETS when he determines (1) \"that employees are exposed to grave danger from exposure to substances or agents determined to be toxic or physically harmful or from new hazards,\" and (2) \"that such emergency standard is necessary to protect employees from such danger.\"[1] An ETS may be in place for up to six months, at which point OSHA must issue a permanent standard that has been adopted through ordinary rulemaking processes.[2] This would be OSHA's second COVID ETS, following an ETS adopted in June that was limited to the health care sector.[3]\n\nOSHA likely does not plan a notice-and-comment process for the forthcoming rule, which is not required for an ETS. As a consequence, the standard's specific requirements likely will become known the day of publication, with an effective date shortly thereafter. Uncertainties that issuance of the rule should resolve include how it would apply to employees working at home, or to workers at remote locations without contact with other employees.\n\nThe decision to adopt the rule as an \"emergency\" and \"temporary\" standard, without notice and comment, could be one focus of a legal challenge. A challenge may also target the rule's wage-payment requirement; wages are not a subject that OSHA ordinarily regulates, and the requirement arguably contrasts with Congress's decision to let the COVID-related paid leave programs established by the Families First Coronavirus Response Act expire after December 31, 2020. If the ETS requires vaccination for workers who recently had and recovered from COVID-19, that could be targeted also.\n\nExecutive Orders requiring vaccinations for employees of federal contractors, and for all federal workers.\n\nIn announcing the OSHA ETS, the President also issued separate Executive Orders regarding vaccination of employees of federal contractors, and regarding vaccination of federal workers."}

She spends her evenings on the outdoor patio of Mar-a-Lago, where she prefers fish for an entrée, according to the source, and is often joined at the table by her parents, Viktor and Amalija Knavs, who reside in a private suite of rooms at Mar-a-Lago for much of the year.\n\nThough she is now a former first lady of the United States, her daily routine has not seen a significant change.\n\n\"It's pretty much the same as it was before (she was first lady) or even when she would come down during vacations,\" said the source familiar with Trump's schedule, noting there is not much evidence to delineate pre- and post-White House activities or work.\n\nMelania Trump's office did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment.\n\nTrump is in the midst of setting up an official office and has hired three former employees from her East Wing staff in the hopes of resurrecting her Be Best campaign of helping children, continuing her \"work,\" as she calls it to friends.\n\nMoments of bitterness\n\nYet there have been moments of bitterness and regret, say several people with knowledge of Trump's conversations of late, most notably since Joe Biden's inauguration and with respect to the activities of her successor, Jill Biden.\n\nWhen Trump left Washington, she had the worst favorability ratings of any modern first lady upon departure from the White House, according to polling conducted by SSRS for CNN.\n\nAt one time, early in her tenure, that wasn't the case – Melania Trump was the most-liked member of the Trump family and the broader administration. But it's possible that Donald Trump's incendiary style, even though not necessarily something his wife condoned, had the residual effect of chipping away at the first lady's popularity. After the January 6 attack on the Capitol, Melania Trump did not make a statement denouncing the violence for five days.\n\n\"She could see how it was going to go for her,\" said one former White House official who spoke to CNN, noting that Trump felt she was in a lose-lose predicament whether she spoke publicly or not. If she condemned the violence, her husband and his base would be angered and it would create a stir about her breaking with the President. And by staying silent, she was implying support for what happened.\n\n\"Once (the insurrection) happened, she knew there was nothing to gain for her by speaking out or doing something – so she didn't do anything,\" the former White House official said.\n\nTwo members of the first lady's staff resigned shortly after the deadly insurrection in protest of the administration's seeming acquiescence.\n\nTrump, according to a person familiar with her schedule, had planned on going to Biden's inauguration and learned she would not be attending when her husband tweeted he would not go."}

But winter storm-related supply chain shortages are different than those consumers experienced during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIt's a matter of supply and demand, said David Anderson, Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service economist, Bryan-College Station.\n\n\"This is not another COVID situation from last March,\" Anderson said. \"This is a really harsh winter storm. Of course, the effects have been exacerbated by the electric grid and water problems.\"\n\nHe explained that snow and ice storms, as well as other weather events, can and do cause food production problems, both short- and long-term.\n\nMany AgriLife Extension agents and specialists, as well as other government officials, are assessing damages this week and turning those reports in for a state assessment of expected losses and economic impacts. Some impacts can be seen immediately, while others, especially on crops subjected to freezing temperatures for extended periods, need some time to materialize once the snow and ice have melted away.\n\n\"If a cattle packing plant is shut down, then beef production will be lower one week but back up the next,\" he said. \"Also, these weather events may destroy crops like vegetables or fruit. If they do, then we'll have tighter supplies and higher prices until the next production can occur either from another region of the world or part of the U.S. If the storm killed a lot of chickens, then we might have lower production for a few months and higher prices.\"\n\nSo, while this is a transportation and supply chain issue again, it is one that will be mostly short in nature. What occurred last week and through the weekend in the stores is the result of understandable occurrences, Anderson said. With a little more time to resupply shelves, things should soon be back to normal, he said, as it's not a food production problem.\n\n\"In extreme events like this people go to the store and buy a lot of stuff to get through the event,\" he said. \"Then, during the event, the trucks to resupply the shelves can't get through, so there is nothing there. And all the folks working to refill the shelves were also affected by the storm — their homes faced the same problem, they have trouble getting to work, and the trucks can't move until the storm passes.\"\n\nHowever, Anderson said, this situation was a consumer issue as well – one seen during the early stages of the pandemic. In addition to overcoming the urge to overbuy on some items, consumers had to learn to be flexible in their choices until things returned to normal.\n\n\"I can't help but think there is some demand side to this too,\" he said. \"All of us consumers rush out to buy stuff, overwhelming the system. That's fine. You need to get stocked up for not being able to go out. But I think also we could probably all use some flexibility. We expect the shelves to be full no matter what. We expect to be able to get whatever we want, whenever we want it, regardless of season. I think some flexibility, planning and patience would help us all.\""}

He is the only modern pro to win all four major golf titles in succession, taking the U.S. Open, British Open and PGA Championship in 2000 and the Masters title in 2001, a feat that became known a the Tiger Slam.\n\nHAZARDOUS ROAD STRETCH\n\nIn a statement to Golf Digest magazine, Woods' agent, Mark Steinberg, said the winner of 15 major championships was undergoing surgery.\n\nThe cause of the accident was under investigation, though the sheriff said weather was not a factor.\n\nVideo footage from the scene showed Woods' dark gray 2021 Genesis sport utility vehicle badly crumpled and lying on its side near the bottom of the hillside, its windows smashed.\n\nWoods' vehicle swerved across the median strip into an oncoming lane then struck a curb and a tree as it plunged off the road and down an embankment, Villanueva said, adding \"there were several rollovers\" before the SUV came to rest. The sheriff said the steep and winding stretch of road \"has a high frequency of accidents.\"\n\nThe sheriff also said the distance the vehicle traveled before leaving the roadway, with no visible skid marks, pointed to the car \"going at a relatively greater speed than normal.\"\n\nFire department officials said emergency personnel pulled Woods from the vehicle through the front windshield after the glass and its surrounding frame were cut out and removed."}

The network aired its segment about Dominion in November, before the company wrote a letter raising the prospect of legal action against those making or providing a platform for what it claims are defamatory statements.\n\nMy Pillow CEO Mike Lindell has seen his personal and corporate Twitter accounts suspended in the past week due to violating a disinformation standard regarding his repeated false claim that President Donald Trump won the November election.\n\nHe was shut down again Tuesday for propagating that conspiracy theory, but this time by a surprising source: Newsmax, the Trump-friendly, right-wing upstart cable network. After repeatedly trying to cut Lindell off as he perpetuated election falsehoods, Newsmax anchor Bob Sellers eventually gave up and, in a bizarre scene, got up and walked away from his anchor chair.\n\nIn December, Newsmax aired a segment shooting down election-fraud claims after two election-technology companies, Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic, raised the prospect of legal action over what they claim is false reporting about them. Dominion has since filed a $1.3 billion defamation suit against former Trump lawyer Sidney Powell.\n\nTuesday's Newsmax segment featuring Lindell, a Trump ally, was set up to discuss his Twitter suspensions and whether they fit into the larger context of \"cancel culture.\" Last week, Twitter permanently banned Lindell's personal account for perpetuating the falsehood that the election was rigged. On Monday, the company's corporate Twitter account was permanently suspended after Twitter said Lindell used it to get around the personal ban.\n\nTwitter suspended Trump's account permanently earlier in January when he was still president, citing the risk that he would incite further violence after a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\nWhen Newsmax anchor Heather Childers, appearing on a separate screen from Sellers, asked Lindell about the Twitter suspensions, he started spewing false claims about Dominion machines and Sellers immediately stepped in, talking over the pillow pitchman.\n\n\"Mike, Mike,\" Sellers started, trying to interrupt Lindell multiple times. \"Mike, you're talking about machines that we at Newsmax have not been able to verify any of those kinds of allegations. We just want to let people know that there's nothing substantive that we've seen.\"\n\nSellers and his producers appear to have been prepared for Lindell's allegations, as the anchor had a prepared text at the ready.\n\n\"Let me read you something,\" said Sellers. \"While there (was) some clear evidence of some cases of vote fraud and election irregularities, the election results in every state were certified and Newsmax accepts the results as legal and final. The courts have also supported that view.\"\n\n\"So, we wanted to talk to you about canceling culture. We don't want to re-litigate the allegations that you're making, Mike,\" Sellers said as Lindell spoke over him, gesticulating toward the camera.\n\nWhen the anchor followed up by asking whether Lindell could make an argument that the Twitter ban should be temporary, not permanent, the My Pillow magnate went back to his earlier claims."}

I responded as politely as I could that Trump continues to heave himself almost daily into the news with false claims about a \"rigged\" presidential election and with ongoing attacks on the free press and even on members of his own party.\n\nHad I waited a few days to respond to the email, I would have included an excellent example of Trump's ongoing lack of common decency when he issued a tasteless statement following the death of statesman and trail-blazing military hero Gen. Colin Powell.\n\nPowell, 84, a longtime Republican who became a Trump critic, died Oct. 18 of COVID-19, amid a battle with cancer.\n\nShowing his usual lack of class, Trump said the following: \"Wonderful to see Colin Powell, who made big mistakes on Iraq and famously, so-called weapons of mass destruction, be treated in death so beautifully by the Fake News Media. Hope that happens to me someday. He was a classic RINO (Republican in name only), if even that, always being the first to attack other Republicans. He made plenty of mistakes, but anyway, may he rest in peace!\"\n\nTrump's criticism of Powell was in stark contrast to the well-deserved praise Powell received from various political leaders, both Republicans and Democrats. Trump can hope all he wants, but he was such a horrible president I'm certain neither the legitimate news media nor historians will treat him \"beautifully\" after he dies.\n\nAlso, as he often does, Trump was really speaking about himself when he accused Powell of attacking other Republicans. Trump has trashed a long hit list of Republican leaders over the years, including former President George W. Bush, former House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Trump's one-time Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and his Vice President Mike Pence, who wouldn't kowtow to Trump's blatant attempt to steal the election.\n\nIt's not the first time Trump has insulted a hero. Remember when he belittled Arizona Sen. John McCain, who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam? Trump said McCain, who died in 2018, was no hero because he got captured. Remember when news outlets reported that Trump called America's heroic war dead \"losers\" and \"suckers.\"\n\nTrump is no match for Powell – intellectually, as a patriot or a human being. Powell served in the Army for 35 years. He was a Vietnam veteran, a four-star general, and the first Black Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton. He was secretary of state under George W. Bush from 2001 to 2005.\n\nTrump is a draft dodger, failed businessman with multiple company bankruptcies, and a grifter who has conned millions of people into believing he is their political savior. Trump continues to collect millions of dollars in donations from supporters who believe his lies that Democrats cheated him out of the presidency. Even his statement disparaging Powell included a request for money.\n\nPowell was man enough to regret his role in the invasion of Iraq, calling it a blot on his record. He considered the weapons of mass destruction fiasco \"one of the worst intelligence failures in U.S. history.\" Contrast that to Trump's refusal to take responsibility for anything negative that occurred during his presidency, including his administration's poor handling of the COVID-19 epidemic that so far has killed 750,000 Americans."}

I support the BLM movement, I support peacefully demonstrating,\" Rittenhouse tells Carlson in excerpts of the interview released by Fox News ahead of its airing.\n\n\"The jury reached the correct verdict -- self-defense is not illegal,\" Rittenhouse said, according to Agence France-Presse. \"I'm glad that everything went well. ...

Pool/CBS News\n\nRittenhouse was 17 last year when he traveled 20 miles from his home in Antioch, Illinois, to Kenosha, Wisconsin, which had been racked with protests in the wake of the Aug. 23 shooting of Jacob Blake. That shooting and the response in Kenosha - protests that turned destructive - became part of the national reckoning over police use of force against Black people following George Floyd's death in Minneapolis the previous May at the hands of police.\n\nRittenhouse, armed with an AR-style semiautomatic rifle, joined others who said they were intent on protecting private property from potential damage on Aug. 25. During his trial, prosecutors argued that the teenager was a \"wannabe soldier\" who went looking for trouble that night. Rittenhouse countered that he fired in self-defense after he was attacked and was in fear for his life.\n\nThe shootings quickly made Rittenhouse a rallying cry for supporters of Second Amendment rights and those angered by the sometimes violent protests seen in some American cities after Floyd's death."}

This came as little surprise to anyone who watched the trial with an open mind.\n\nRegardless of one's thoughts on the wisdom of a 17-year-old arming himself to defend the livelihoods of strangers, Rittenhouse had strong claims of lawful self-defense, and conviction seemed like an uphill battle for the state from the outset.\n\nAnd yet, countless blue-check pundits on social media immediately lost their collective minds in a race-baiting game of \"What if Rittenhouse was black?\"\n\nTheir presumptive implication is that Rittenhouse's acquittal was based entirely on his race. Several highly followed commentators went so far as to explicitly assert that no person of color could ever intentionally shoot someone with a gun he or she carried in public and be acquitted on grounds of lawful self-defense.\n\nThe idea that self-defense is a legal justification largely for white Americans and that no jury would ever acquit defendants of color who claim they acted in self-defense is not just overly reductive, it's absurd.\n\nIt's also easily disprovable with a basic Google search.\n\nConsider just some of the many non-white defendants who were acquitted of murder or attempted murder charges in recent years because juries determined they acted in lawful self-defense:\n\nTony Bristol —A jury acquitted Bristol on all charges related to a confrontation during which he fatally shot one man and wounded another. The prosecution argued that Bristol intentionally armed himself with a gun just before the confrontation and shot the two unarmed men—one in the back—over a longstanding interpersonal dispute.

Please refer to revised SAGE Prioritization Roadmap for the latest recommendations.\n\nThe World Health Organization, with the support of the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization and its COVID-19 Vaccines Working Group, continues to review the emerging evidence on the need for and timing of a booster dose for the currently available COVID-19 vaccines which have received Emergency Use Listing (EUL). This statement reflects the current understanding of vaccine performance and supply as presented to SAGE on 7 December 2021. It summarizes and contextualizes current evidence on booster vaccination. In recent weeks the SARS-CoV2 Omicron variant has emerged. Data are currently insufficient to assess the impact of this new variant of concern on vaccine effectiveness, in particular against severe disease. The statements and conclusions in this document will therefore be updated as data become available.\n\nDefinitions:\n\nThe following definitions and terminology are used by WHO throughout its policy recommendations on COVID-19 vaccination. This note focuses only on booster doses.\n\nBooster doses are administered to a vaccinated population that has completed a primary vaccination series (currently one or two doses of EUL COVID-19 vaccine depending on the product) when, with time, the immunity and clinical protection has fallen below a rate deemed sufficient in that population.

The objective of a booster dose is to restore vaccine effectiveness from that deemed no longer sufficient. Additional doses of a vaccine may be needed as part of an extended primary series for target populations where the immune response rate following the standard primary series is deemed insufficient. The objective of an additional dose in the primary series is to enhance the immune response to establish a sufficient level of effectiveness against disease. In particular, immunocompromised individuals often fail to mount a protective immune response after a standard primary series, but also older adults may respond poorly to a standard primary series with some vaccines (1).\n\nGlobal context\n\nThe Director-General of WHO has called for a moratorium on booster vaccination for healthy adults until the end of 2021 to counter the persisting and profound inequity in global vaccine access (2). While many countries are far from reaching the 40% coverage target by the end of 2021, other countries have vaccinated well beyond this threshold, already reaching children and implementing extensive booster vaccination programmes. At the time of release of this statement, globally about 20% of COVID-19 vaccine doses, daily, are used for booster or additional dose vaccination."}

Thirteen U.S. service members were killed. The vast majority of the casualties were Afghans — 170 killed and at least 200 wounded, with the figures poised to rise in the coming days.

They were working class as well as highly educated professionals and included doctors, journalists, athletes and tailors.\n\nBut the victims shared something in common: a desire to leave their country and the brutality and uncertainty of life under their new Taliban rulers. Such was their desperation to board a flight out of Kabul that they arrived despite public warnings that the airport was a possible target of the Islamic State.\n\nHere are portraits of a few of them:\n\nALI REZA AHMADI\n\nAli Reza Ahmadi, 36, had fled the Taliban before. When the group first seized Kabul in 1996, he escaped as a child to Iran, where he grew up as a refugee and graduated from high school. He returned to Kabul after the Taliban was toppled from power in 2001. He enrolled at Kabul University, graduating with a degree in journalism in 2013.\n\n\"When we were studying and discussing under trees on Kabul University's campus, we never thought we would be here today,\" said Basir Ebadi, a classmate and friend of Ahmadi. \"Ali Reza was the hopeful one. He imagined an Afghanistan free of violence.\"\n\nAs the Taliban gradually expanded its control over the country, Ahmadi co-founded a news agency, Raha News Agency, and worked as a freelance reporter for local media outlets.\n\nWhen the Taliban entered Kabul on Aug. 15, Ahmadi lost hope. In the first week of the group's rule, Ahmadi wrote in a Facebook post that he had sold off 60 of his books for 50 Afghani (less than $1). He wanted to flee the country.\n\n\"He wanted to save his life,\" said Ebadi, who spoke with Ahmadi a few days ago. \"He encouraged me to pack my bags and flee the country. He said that the Taliban would censor us if they do not kill us now. He said this place is no longer a place for living.\"\n\nAhmadi had no documents for boarding an evacuation flight. Still, he decided on Thursday to try his luck, along with his 33-year-old brother, Mujtaba. They carried their passports and national ID — and the hope that they could somehow enter the airport's gate and hop on to a flight to freedom.\n\nAli's body was unrecognizable after the blast. Mujtaba is still missing.\n\n\"We never thought we would lose [Ali] in this brutal way,\" said Ebadi. \"He had dreams and hopes.\""}

No, this isn't a movie\n\nThe inauguration was witnessed by several people and broadcast live by numerous outlets. Biden has been seen several times in the White House.\n\nClaims that the inauguration was fake or that Joe Biden is not the real president are not accurate. There's no evidence.\n\nA new conspiracy theory has blossomed among some people who believed that former President Donald Trump had an elaborate scheme to remain in office: that Biden's inauguration was fake, and he isn't the real president.\n\nThe theory started to gain traction online when the Jan. 20 \"storm\" disrupting Biden's inauguration didn't happen. It points to a myriad of ill-perceived discrepancies for what a real inauguration and presidency should look like.\n\nThese claims fall short. Biden is the real president and his inauguration was legit. The day's events were broadcast and live-streamed by several outlets including ABC, CNN, C-SPAN, Fox News, NBC and PBS.\n\nThe event was much smaller this year due to COVID-19 restrictions. But we know it happened because it was witnessed and documented by elected officials, former presidents, military members, reporters, photographers and performers.\n\nSocial media posts and videos spreading the theory were flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWe debunked a variety of claims that argue the inauguration didn't happen and that Biden isn't the legitimate president.\n\n\"The White House's inauguration video was unlisted\"\n\nSome people on Facebook claimed that the White House's official inauguration video was unlisted on YouTube because it had more dislikes than likes.\n\nIndeed, the 34-minute video has many more dislikes than likes — currently 76,000 to 14,000 — but it is still up on the White House YouTube channel. Web archives show no record that the video was ever taken down.\n\n\"Biden's executive orders aren't available online\"\n\nAccording to one viral video, Trump's executive orders were available on the Office of the Federal Register website \"immediately,\" while there are still no sign of Biden's.\n\nThat's false. Biden's executive orders may not have been uploaded at the time the video was made, but the documents are published on the site now. The online register shows that it also took a few days for Trump's orders to be published after they were signed.\n\n\"Biden's granddaughters disappeared and reappeared in between frames of inauguration coverage\"\n\nSome claim that the inauguration was staged because Biden's granddaughters, who were standing behind him when he took the oath of office, suddenly disappeared in certain shots.\n\nThey didn't. Biden's granddaughters may not have been visible at certain points due to different camera angles, but they were present throughout the oath and did not move. They can also be seen standing behind Biden in photographs taken by Reuters and the Associated Press.\n\n\"Biden took a private plane to D.C.\"\n\nBiden's form of travel has nothing to do with the legitimacy of his presidency.\n\nBiden originally planned to travel to Washington by train from Delaware, but that plan changed when it was deemed too great a security risk. So he took a private jet, which was also a break from tradition.\n\nUsually the outgoing administration provides a government plane to bring the president-elect to Washington for the inauguration. Trump, who refused to acknowledge Biden's victory until early January, opted to not attend the inauguration, becoming the first outgoing president in more than a century to skip the event.\n\nWe previously reached out to the White House, but couldn't confirm whether the Trump administration offered to provide transportation to the Bidens. CNN reported that \"a source familiar with the matter\" said the government didn't offer the Bidens a plane, but did not provide further details.\n\n\"Biden's Oval Office is a movie set\"\n\nSome social media users have shared photos of Biden in the Oval Office and say they provide proof that it's not the real presidential office but a movie set owned by Castle Rock Entertainment.\n\nFilm sets of the famous room exist, but there is no credible evidence that supports this. Biden made a public entrance into the White House on Jan. 20 and was photographed in the Oval Office shortly after. He has been seen in the White House several times in the days that have followed.\n\nSome point to a vehicle visible outside the window behind the Resolute Desk as Biden sits there, saying there is no parking lot in that location. But the Oval Office overlooks the South Lawn and has a private road and circular driveway, both places where the car could have been parked.\n\nOur ruling\n\nA conspiracy theory circulating on social media says that Biden's inauguration was fake and that he isn't the real president.\n\nThe evidence is paltry. Biden was legally inaugurated as the 46th U.S. president on Jan. 20."}

I'm a brother,\" he said. \"I was there to listen and offer my take. And my advice to my brother was simple and consistent: Own what you did. Tell people what you can do to be better. Be contrite.

The ship, one of the largest in the world, became horizontally wedged in the canal last Tuesday. Since then crews worked night and day to free the vessel, which at more than 1,300 feet is almost as long as the Empire State Building is tall. Ultimately, the ship was dislodged around 9 a.m. ET on Monday after more than 10 tugboats arrived on the scene, along with specialized dredging equipment and expert salvage teams all working together to free the 220,000-ton vessel. But while traffic has now resumed in the key waterway, the repercussions after days of halted movement will continue to be felt.\n\nAround 12% of global trade flows through the Suez Canal on massive ships like the Ever Given, which can hold 20,000 containers. Lloyd's List estimates that more than $9 billion worth of goods passes through the 120-mile waterway each day, translating to around $400 million per hour. \"The disruption of a week of this size is going to continue to have cascading effects ... it's got to be at least 60 days before things get sorted out and appear to be a bit back to normal,\" said Stephen Flynn, professor of political science at Northeastern University. \"This level of disruption cascaded after every 24 hours,\" he added. The knock-on effects include congestion at ports as well as vessels not being in the right place for their next scheduled journey. Most importantly, it further exacerbates supply chains already reeling from a container shortage amid the Covid-19 buying boom. Flynn, who is also founding director at the Global Resilience Institute, noted that this is one of the challenges of a just-in-time system. Assembly lines will be idled because parts don't show up when they're expected, for example.\n\n\"It's never been stressed this badly before, and it's going to take a really long time, and they're just beginning the process of sorting it out ... you've essentially created this traffic jam that doesn't allow you just to reset and restart — you have to restack and reset the system and that's something that's going to take a lot of choreography,\" Flynn added. In the hunt for efficiency and low-cost goods, ships have become larger and larger. Not all ports can handle ships the size of the Ever Given, creating concentrated systems. Ships of this size might sail from China to Rotterdam — the path the Ever Given was on — where its containers might then be loaded onto smaller ships that sail to the rest of Europe or other destinations including the United States. In other words, smaller ports can't just absorb the scheduling conflicts created by the traffic jam at the Suez Canal. Nearly 19,000 ships passed through the canal during 2020, for an average of 51.5 per day, according to the Suez Canal Authority. By Monday morning, more than 350 vessels total were backed up on both ends of the Suez Canal, as the Ever Given cut off access in both directions. Shipping agent GAC said that traffic was expected to be back to normal in the next three to four days."}

Paxlovid is available by prescription only and should be initiated as soon as possible after diagnosis of COVID-19 and within five days of symptom onset.\n\n\"Today's authorization introduces the first treatment for COVID-19 that is in the form of a pill that is taken orally — a major step forward in the fight against this global pandemic,\" said Patrizia Cavazzoni, M.D., director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. \"This authorization provides a new tool to combat COVID-19 at a crucial time in the pandemic as new variants emerge and promises to make antiviral treatment more accessible to patients who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19.\"\n\nPaxlovid is not authorized for the pre-exposure or post-exposure prevention of COVID-19 or for initiation of treatment in those requiring hospitalization due to severe or critical COVID-19. Paxlovid is not a substitute for vaccination in individuals for whom COVID-19 vaccination and a booster dose are recommended. The FDA has approved one vaccine and authorized others to prevent COVID-19 and serious clinical outcomes associated with a COVID-19 infection, including hospitalization and death. The FDA urges the public to get vaccinated and receive a booster if eligible. Learn more about FDA-approved or -authorized COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nPaxlovid consists of nirmatrelvir, which inhibits a SARS-CoV-2 protein to stop the virus from replicating, and ritonavir, which slows down nirmatrelvir's breakdown to help it remain in the body for a longer period at higher concentrations. Paxlovid is administered as three tablets (two tablets of nirmatrelvir and one tablet of ritonavir) taken together orally twice daily for five days, for a total of 30 tablets. Paxlovid is not authorized for use for longer than five consecutive days.\n\nThe issuance of an EUA is different than an FDA approval. In determining whether to issue an EUA, the FDA evaluates the totality of scientific evidence available and carefully balances any known or potential risks with any known or potential benefits of the product. Based on the FDA's review of the totality of the scientific evidence available, the agency has determined that it is reasonable to believe that Paxlovid may be effective for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in authorized patients. The agency has also determined that the known and potential benefits of Paxlovid, when used consistent with the terms and conditions of the authorization, outweigh the known and potential risks of the product. There are no adequate, approved and available alternatives to Paxlovid for the treatment of COVID-19."}

As the nation's eyes were focused on the pipeline attack this week, another hacker group was busy targeting Washington DC police – striking at law enforcement in the American capital.\n\nBut it was the pipeline attack that had the most impact, emerging from the dark web and sending tens of thousands of Americans to panic-buy gas for their cars. The 5,500 mile-long pipeline, which carries 45% of the east coast's fuel supplies, announced on Saturday that it had been forced to shut down after attackers used the internet to seize control of the fuel-pumping operation.\n\nOn Wednesday, Colonial Pipeline said it had \"initiated the restart\" of operations, reportedly after paying a $5m ransom fee. But that didn't stop hours-long lines continuing to form at gas stations in the south-east US, as fuel began to dry up and the price of gas hit its highest point in years.\n\nA group of cybercriminals called Darkside has taken responsibility for the ransomware attack, which works by hacking into a company, or government's, network, and scrambling the data. The hacker then posts a note in the system demanding payment. If the organization pays up, the hacker hands back control.\n\n\"The analogy would be I break into your house, and once I get access to your house, I change all of the locks, and lock you out of your own house,\" said Eric Cole, author of the book Cyber Crisis and founder of the Secure Anchor cybersecurity company.\n\n\"And then I say: 'Hey, unless you give me money, I'm not going to give you the keys to your house.'\"\n\nThe Colonial Pipeline debacle is merely the latest in a spate of ransomware attacks, which include the targeting of a water treatment plant in Florida, and the Texas-based SolarWinds IT company.\n\nUS police forces have also been a focus. The Babuk group, another Russian cyber gang, is currently holding up the Washington DC police department, threatening to release stolen data unless law enforcement cough up an unspecified amount of money.\n\nThe Presque Isle police department was attacked in April, police in Azusa were hit in March, while the city of Baltimore suffered a costly attack in 2019.\n\nAs the number of attacks rise, Darkside has become one of the more prominent groups, and Cole said it has managed to \"commercialize cybercrime\".\n\n\"They've been in operation for over three years, they started around 2018, and they typically focus on lower end ransoms,\" he said. \"The average Darkside attack would ask for anywhere from $80,000 to $100,000 ransom, and they would typically do eight to 10 of these attacks a month, so they were bringing in about $12m a year.\n\n\"But we've noticed in the last couple of months they ​started targeting and going after bigger organizations. Colonial really shows their change in business model – where now instead of going after 12 small entities they go after one big one.\"\n\nThe Washington Post reported that 26 government agencies have been hit by ransomware since the beginning of the year. The number of private companies targeted is difficult to calculate, given no company wants to reveal to the world, and to other would-be attackers, that they will pay up if compromised, but it's likely the number of reported attacks are just the \"tip of the iceberg\", one expert said.\n\nIn most cases, organizations have little option but to pay the ransom. After the city of Baltimore was attacked in May 2019, it decided not to pay the ransom of 13 bitcoins, which at the time came to roughly $91,000. It was a noble move, but not a financially successful one – Baltimore ended up spending more than $18m on recovery.\n\nThe FBI and other security experts say Darkside is made up of a group of criminals based in Russia, but little is known beyond that."}

Right-leaning detractors are thrilled the brash and showy prime-time talker finally got his comeuppance. But in a micro sense, Cuomo's departure means little in the media landscape, even at CNN. His ratings had deteriorated and his agenda-driven shtick had run its course.\n\nThere is something to be learned, however, from the Cuomo/CNN screwup, if the news industry is willing to do some soul searching on a broader scale.\n\nCuomo's departure should be viewed more generally than just an accumulation of missteps that CNN could no longer tolerate. This fiasco needs to be assessed in the context of the news profession's limitations and conventional wisdoms, which no longer serve the citizens' information needs in a democracy.\n\nJournalism has always had a casual relationship with codes of ethics, but they have been established for good reason by reputable organizations such as the Society of Professional Journalists and the Radio Television Digital News Association. CNN's management surely overlooked these standards in its handling of Cuomo, acting like it had never heard of the concept of conflict of interest.\n\nCNN looked the other way as Cuomo interviewed his brother governor multiple times during the early days of the COVID-19 story. The segments served as political PR stunts for a governor with possible presidential aspirations and a book to sell. Other segments ventured into stand-up comedy, with jokes and props about COVID-19 testing. In the midst of the national COVID-19 crisis, this demented New York \"bros\" routine was not the least bit funny. Given CNN's permission for such editorial nonsense, it is little wonder Chris Cuomo felt bulletproof, so to speak, and saw no barriers to further pushing ethical boundaries when he immersed himself in his brother's management of harassment allegations.\n\nWhile Cuomo finally paid the price for brazen ethical lapses, the news industry should consider that shenanigans similar to what put Chris Cuomo on the bus to journalism Siberia are happening elsewhere in the industry.\n\nCuomo is hardly the only \"anchor\" on cable or broadcast prone to mixing a bit of news with entertainment. He's not the only news personality getting paid mega-money to the point journalistic gumption goes out the door. He's not the only celebrity mouth who shoehorns a few facts into a conjured narrative to suit his own opinions, conveniently omitting context or details that might get in the way.\n\nThe electronic media's mishandling of countless stories has led to national confusion and cultural polarization. Stories from Waukesha to Rittenhouse to Smollett were handled not to inform the citizenry but to work them. Professional standards found in journalism codes of ethics could have helped guide the nation's news agenda, but seem instead to have no traction with the news industry's executives.\n\nThe nation's news consumers are savvy enough to know when they are being underserved. Media credibility studies underscore the public's disappointment. Only a third of Americans have any trust in political news they receive, according to Rasmussen Reports. Gallup surveys mirror that dismal result, with public confidence in media near record lows.\n\nCitizens with such low opinions of the journalism profession will either stop consuming news or rely on getting news from social media — both inadequate alternatives for a healthy democracy."}

President Donald Trump has not reached out to President-elect Joe Biden or invited him to the White House, and has instead spent the weeks since he lost the Nov. 3 election holed up at the White House, trying to undermine the legitimacy of Biden's win with baseless claims of mass voter fraud that culminated in last week's violent storming of the Capitol building.\n\nPence, who didn't speak with Trump for days after the siege, has become an unexpected — albeit late — defender of Biden's win. The vice president resisted enormous pressure from Trump to try to interfere in Congress' certification of the Electoral College vote count last week — even though he has no such power. And he has announced that he will attend Biden's Jan. 20 inauguration, which Trump is refusing to do — making him just the fourth president in the nation's history to skip the symbolic passing of the torch.\n\nPence and Harris spoke Thursday afternoon and had a \"good call,\" according to one of the people familiar with the conversation, with Pence congratulating Harris and offering his assistance. The people spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the private exchange.\n\nThe call came less than a week before Biden and Harris take office and just over a week after Trump supporters violently stormed the Capitol and tried to halt the peaceful transition of power after he delivered a speech calling on them to \"fight.\" Five people died, including a Capitol Police officer, and Trump got impeached on a charge of incitement of an insurrection.\n\nWhile Trump has remained largely behind closed doors, without his Twitter bullhorn and fuming since his loss, Pence has been stepping up and fulfilling many of the ceremonial duties of the presidency.\n\nOn Thursday, Pence received a briefing at the Federal Emergency Management Agency headquarters in Washington from the FBI and other agencies on inauguration security and stopped by to thank White House phone operators, giving them a framed letter of appreciation. Later, he greeted members of the National Guard now protecting the Capitol building from further attack.\n\nThis weekend, he will travel to thank the troops — first flying to Lemoore, California, to deliver remarks to sailors, and then to Fort Drum, New York, to speak before 10th Mountain Division soldiers, many of whom recently returned from Afghanistan."}

The lawmaker's 25-year-old son died by suicide just a week before the January 6 riot at the Capitol.

Here's what to know\n\nOne-hundred sixty-one million third stimulus check payments have been made to individuals and families who qualify for the payments. That includes \"plus-up payments\" for those eligible for a larger check based on their 2020 tax returns. But what happens if the IRS sent you stimulus money you didn't actually qualify for? It could be that you'll have to return the amount you were overpaid. (This applies to the child tax credit, too.)\n\nWe'll go through scenarios where you'd have to return stimulus money you received for any of the three checks. For example, with the first stimulus check, the IRS accidentally sent out payments to people who weren't eligible. If you received a check in error, there are specific ways to send the money back, depending on the payment method used -- paper check, EIP card or direct deposit.\n\nRead on for details to know. For more information, here's how you could get up to $50,000 back with one-time COVID credits, and what we know about student loan debt forgiveness.

John Bel Edwards said at a press conference Sunday afternoon.\n\n\"We're just getting started,\" he said.\n\nThe storm came ashore as a Category 4 storm in Port Fourchon on the Louisiana coast just before noon Sunday. With 150 mile-per-hour winds, it is one of the strongest hurricanes to make landfall in Louisiana since the middle of the 19th century.\n\n\"There is no doubt that the coming days and weeks are going to be extremely difficult for our state, and many, many people are going to be tested in ways that we can only imagine today,\" Edwards said. \"But I can also tell you that, as a state, we've never been more prepared.\"\n\nIda arrived on the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina — which destroyed much of New Orleans – and two days after the first anniversary of Hurricane Laura, which devastated Lake Charles in the southwestern region of the state.\n\nEdwards said southeastern Louisiana residents who stayed for Hurricane Ida need to be prepared to \"shelter in place\" for 72 hours after the storm has passed. Search and rescue crews won't be able to start their work until Monday morning, he said.\n\n\"We will be ready at first light tomorrow morning to go out in those areas that we know already have received the most damaging impacts of the storm,\" Edwards said.\n\nLouisiana's entire National Guard — nearly 5,000 people — have been called up to service. The state fire marshal, law enforcement and Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries agents will also be involved in search and rescue missions — and there's an additional 900 people on loan from 16 other states available to help, Edwards said.\n\nBy Sunday evening, Ida had already hit Louisiana's coastal towns like Houma, which is home to a large segment of the state's commercial fishing operations and the nexus of the offshore oil and gas industry. Ida also walloped Grand Isle, a popular vacation spot, though Edwards said almost the entire population of that barrier island had been evacuated before the storm.\n\nFrom Sunday evening to Monday morning, Ida is expected to creep its way up into the most populous areas of Louisiana — hitting New Orleans, Baton Rouge and the northshore of Lake Pontchartrain hard. Communities will not not only face the strongest winds they have seen in decades, but may also be inundated with flooding for much of the rest of the week, according to local weather reports.\n\nMany coastal parishes put mandatory evacuations in place Friday. Notably, New Orleans did not. New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell said the storm was moving too quickly by Friday evening to safely make that call, but thousands of residents fled the city voluntarily, resulting in hours-long traffic jams on interstates going to Texas and Florida on Saturday.\n\nLouisiana is trying to avoid some of the problems it saw in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The Department of Public Safety and Corrections has agreed to house 2,500 jail detainees and prisoners from Acadia, Plaquemines, St. Mary, Orleans, St. Bernard, Vermillion and Terrebonne parishes. After Hurricane Katrina, people in jails struggled to get access to food and water.\n\nEdwards also insisted Sunday that the state is \"more prepared than it ever has been\" for a hurricane of Ida's magnitude. After Hurricane Katrina, the federal government spent billions of dollars developing a new protection system consisting of levees and floodgates around New Orleans and its surrounding parishes. Though Louisiana has been threatened with other storms in recent years, Hurricane Ida is the first time the state intends to make use of the full protection system.\n\n\"Will [New Orleans storm protection system] be tested? Yes. But it was built for this moment,\" Edwards said.\n\nThe governor said about 1,400 people were being housed in public shelters across the state Sunday afternoon, but expected that number to grow.

The steady stream of users pushed the company's revenue and earnings for the April-June quarter above Wall Street's expectations.\n\nFacebook raked in $29.07 billion in revenue, a 56% rise from the same quarter a year earlier. The company chalked up $3.61 in earnings per share, beating the $3.03 forecast by analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters.\n\nThe strong results come as Facebook continues to face criticism it isn't doing enough to fight false claims about coronavirus vaccines. US President Joe Biden has urged platforms like Facebook to tackle the problem.\n\nThe social network says it directs people to authoritative sources of information, labels posts and works with fact-checkers. The spread of misinformation has been an ongoing problem for the social network, including during the US presidential election. On Wednesday a group of Facebook critics placed body bags in front of the social network's offices in DC as part of a protest against disinformation.\n\nDespite the company beating Wall Street's expectations, Facebook stock was down more than 4% in after-hours trading, to $356.46 per share.

The number of US Facebook users remained flat at 259 million.\n\nFacebook CFO Dave Wehner said in a call with analysts that the drop in European users was due to \"seasonal slowness\" and the impact of countries reopening after more than a year of lockdowns because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nA new Apple feature that restricts Facebook's ability to gather data from its users has also prompted questions about how successfully it'll be able to target ads.\n\n\"We continue to expect increased ad targeting headwinds in 2021 from regulatory and platform changes, notably the recent iOS updates, which we expect to have a greater impact in the third quarter compared to the second quarter.

Powell remained preoccupied with fixing things. The former secretary of state and four-star general tinkered endlessly in his garage — sometimes with his welder and sometimes on a succession of early Volvos, which were less complicated than the Corvette he used to whiz around the Beltway. (He took the Corvette to a track to race against Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his Stingray in the fall of 2016. \"You want a head start?\" Powell goaded Biden. \"Go ahead.\") He was a regular at the neighborhood hardware store in McLean, Va., where he rummaged through parts for his house's malfunctioning dishwasher or leaky faucets.\n\nHis plywood-and-wire fixes often left something to be desired aesthetically. But they satisfied his native frugality, his curiosity about how things worked and, perhaps above all, his compulsion to repair rather than discard what was broken. When he was fixing things, his longtime friend and deputy secretary of state Richard Armitage said, \"there was a result at the end of the day. It's why he was so happy as an Army officer: You take a platoon, and you make it better.\"\n\nAt Powell's memorial service in November, his son, Michael, recalled the time in 1982 when his father, then stationed at Fort Carson in Colorado Springs, bought a pallet of defective adding machines from a government surplus auction so that he could take each of them apart and make them work again. He did not mention that his father's career at the time had hit a brick wall, after receiving a lackluster annual efficiency report. Then and later, Powell refused to blame racism for the matter, though he might have had cause to suspect it. His Jamaican parents had taught him that the way to overcome bigotry was to \"get over it and be better than them,\" as Michael Powell recently told me.\n\nHe did: A decade later, Colin Powell was a four-star general, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and arguably the most admired man in America. His swift ascent seemed to personify the military strategy that came to be known as the Powell doctrine: Establish precise goals, exhaust all diplomatic options, amass support from allies and the public, then defeat the adversary with overwhelming force.\n\nBoth the general and his doctrine became famous during the Persian Gulf war of 1991, an invasion of such brutal efficiency that it lasted all of 100 hours. The victory would not save the presidency of Powell's friend and political benefactor George H.W. Bush. Yet Powell also seemed well suited to the center-left boomer triumphalism of Bush's successor, Bill Clinton, whom Powell served for eight months of the new president's first term. After all, Powell's persona offered the tantalizing prospect of America moving past the two defining fault lines of the 1960s: race and Vietnam.\n\nAfter Powell stepped down, Republicans swooned over the idea of the Black general as their standard-bearer. He and his wife, Alma, eventually decided that a life of electoral politics would not be to their liking. But he was still the most popular political figure in America five years later, when George W. Bush, in his first cabinet appointment, named Powell secretary of state.\n\nBy the beginning of 2003, Powell was faced with a problem that seemed beyond his ability to fix: the commander in chief was determined to go to war with Iraq, hastily and with threadbare support from America's allies. Such a ground invasion flew in the face of the Powell doctrine. Alone among the members of Bush's war council, the secretary of state enumerated to the president the many things that could go disastrously wrong. Still, when Bush asked in January 2003, \"Are you with me on this?\" Powell assured him that he was.\n\n\"What choice did I have?\" Powell told me a decade and a half later. \"He's the president.\" His decision reflected a career built on prevailing from inside the system, ever aware that quitting was exactly what the critics and bigots wanted to see him do. For once, however, the supremely self-confident Powell failed to appreciate his leverage with the American public. Had he resigned in protest, the likely succession of events might well have forestalled the war.\n\n\"They call me the reluctant warrior,\" Powell told me, \"but if you want to go to war, I know how to do it.\" Bush tasked Powell not with overseeing the war but instead selling it to the public. The secretary's infamous speech to the United Nations on Feb. 5, 2003, with its multitude of claims about Saddam Hussein's illicit weapons program that would later be proved false, amounted to an indelible stain on an otherwise remarkable career of public service.\n\nPowell later matter-of-factly described the U.N. speech to his son as the biggest mistake of his career. But he refused to denigrate his former commander in chief — who, after all, had delegated the burden of that speech to the one man in America who had the credibility to deliver it."}

He made plans to enter hospice and have his feeding tube removed but wanted to give his friends a chance to say goodbye.

That means it could be accessed through a password without a second step such as a text message, a common security safeguard in more recent software.\n\n\"In the case of this particular legacy VPN, it only had single-factor authentication,\" Blount said. \"It was a complicated password, I want to be clear on that. It was not a Colonial123-type password.\"\n\nThe panel was convened to examine threats to critical U.S. infrastructure and the Colonial attack, which shut key conduits delivering fuel from Gulf Coast refineries to major East Coast markets. Cyberattacks also hit U.S. meatpacking plants owned by JBS (JBSS3.SA) , showing the breadth of infrastructure facing cyber threats.\n\nThe Colonial Pipeline hack demonstrated that much of the company's infrastructure remains highly vulnerable and the government and companies must work harder to prevent future hacks, senators said during the hearing.\n\nSecurity experts call the use of a single-factor login system a sign of poor cybersecurity \"hygiene.\" They recommend two-factor authentication, which requires a secondary measure like a mobile text or hardware token, and most major companies require this across all internal applications.\n\nSenators questioned Blount about the company's preparations and the timeline for responding to the ransomware attack, which shut the line for days and led to a spike in gasoline prices, panic buying and localized fuel shortages.\n\n\"I'm alarmed this breach ever occurred in the first place,\" said Senator Gary Peters, the committee's chairman. \"Make no mistake: if we do not step up our cyber security readiness, the consequences will be severe.\"\n\nThe FBI attributed the hack to a gang called DarkSide. Some senators suggested Colonial had not sufficiently consulted with the U.S. government before paying the ransom against federal guidelines.\n\nBlount said he made the decision to pay ransom and to keep the payment as confidential as possible because of concern for security.\n\n\"It was our understanding that the decision was solely ours to make about whether to pay the ransom,\" he said.\n\nBlount said Colonial did not have a plan in place to prevent a ransomware attack, but did have an emergency response plan. The company notified the FBI within hours.\n\nBlount said Colonial has invested over $200 million over the last five years in its IT systems. When pressed to answer how much Colonial has spent to keep its pipeline cyber secure, Blount repeated that amount. A company spokesperson later clarified the $200 million was for IT overall, which includes cyber security.\n\nOn Friday, U.S. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco urged companies to tell federal authorities whether they paid ransom to cyberattackers, information that can help investigators.\n\nBlount said even after getting the key from the hackers, the company is still recovering from the attack and is bringing back seven finance systems that have been offline since May 7.\n\nOn Monday, the Justice Department said it had recovered some $2.3 million in cryptocurrency ransom paid by Colonial Pipeline."}

But Twitter warned that Trump could receive a permanent suspension if he continued to break its rules.\n\nIn his first tweet since gaining access to his account, Trump on Thursday evening posted a video in which he condemned the riot by his supporters at the U.S. Capitol and said he would prepare for a smooth presidential transition.\n\nYouTube also removed Trump's Wednesday video. The company said he will accumulate \"strikes\" against his account for continued violations, which could block him from uploading content in the future. Twitch, the live-streaming service owned by Amazon.com Inc., disabled Trump's account indefinitely while Snap Inc. banned the president from posting on its Snapchat app until further notice.\n\nThe bans, while unprecedented, were too little and too late for some. \"Facebook has finally taken the long-overdue step of blocking the President's account – at least for the next 13 days – but I'm deeply frustrated that it took a group of domestic terrorists storming the Capitol before they were willing to do so,\" House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, said in a statement on Thursday. \"I also can't help but wonder if the decision was an opportunistic one, motivated by the news of a Democratically controlled Congress.\"\n\nThompson and civil rights advocates are calling on the social media companies to remove the president's accounts altogether.\n\nTrump, through a spokesman, decried the bans. \"It is indisputable that nobody has been more successful at using digital media than President Trump to communicate directly with the American people,\" said White House spokesman Judd Deere. \"But it's incredibly ironic, yet not surprising, that when the President spoke to the country at a critical time Big Tech chose to censor and block him from doing so. Big Tech is out of control.\""}

Around $465 billion of Biden's $1.9 trillion 'rescue plan' is earmarked to go directly to Americans' wallets.\n\nThe bonus per dependents would be $1,400 and would apply to all dependents. Previously, parents or guardians could only claim the bonus for dependents under 17. Now the bonus can be claimed for college students, disabled adults, and other adults who are dependents.\n\nIf Biden's proposal is the same as the Democrats' $2,000 stimulus plan passed by only the House in December, the income eligibility criteria would mirror the requirements for the current $600 stimulus payments being distributed.\n\nThe payments would reduce gradually for those with adjusted gross income (AGI) over $75,000 for single filers without dependents and $150,000 for married couples without dependents. The phaseout thresholds would change depending on the number of dependents in the household.\n\nEligibility criteria for the $2,000 checks under the CASH Act based on estimated by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\n\nEligibility would likely be based on your most recent tax return and your adjusted gross income. For the second round of checks, the Internal Revenue Service used 2019 tax returns to determine who qualified for the direct payment.\n\nThe $2,000 stimulus checks would also mean a big increase in income for America's poorest families. The 20% of households with the lowest incomes would see their annual income increase by 29% if Congress passed the Democrats' $2,000 stimulus check proposal, the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP) found.

Authorities haven't said if any other items were found, or what was inside the backpack.\n\nLaundrie had been missing for more than a month, having last been seen six days before Petito's body was found in Wyoming's Grand Teton National Park on Sept. 19.\n\nPetito, 22, died from strangulation while on a two-month-long, cross-country road trip with Laundrie. He was named a person of interest in her disappearance on Sept. 15 — after returning home alone in Petito's van on Sept. 1 without her, say authorities.\n\nFor more on the updates on Brian Laundrie's cause of death and funeral plans, and other top stories, listen below to our daily podcast PEOPLE Every Day.\n\nThough Laundrie is dead, many unanswered questions remain.\n\nHere are what legal experts say are authorities' next steps:\n\nSolving Petito's Homicide\n\nDespite the assumption of many that Laundrie killed Petito, former FBI special agent Stuart Kaplan, who is now an attorney, tells PEOPLE the case is still open, legally.\n\n\"We can surmise, we make an assumption, but right now the responsible party for the homicide of Gabby Petito, arguably, is still unsolved,\" Kaplan says.\n\nLocal and state authorities in Florida and Wyoming are still working with the FBI to figure out exactly what happened to the couple who were traveling around the country documenting their adventures on YouTube.\n\n\"I think that the FBI is coordinating local law enforcement's efforts,\" says Kaplan.\n\nInvestigating Laundrie's Cause of Death\n\nAscertaining Laundrie's cause of death will be challenging because his remains were found in an area that was previously underwater.\n\nDental records confirmed that human remains found last week belong to Laundrie.\n\nBut since autopsy results were inconclusive, his remains will be further examined by an anthropologist, Laundrie family attorney Steven Bertolino has told PEOPLE.\n\n\"That seems to make it that much more difficult, because you're now asking someone to try to piece together, potentially, the cause of death,\" says Kaplan. \"Obviously with the degradation or the decomposition of the body, we may never know the actual cause of death.\n\n\"Absent a gunshot wound to the head, where it would've been readily available to see, even by the naked eye, you just may not ever find out what the cause of death was,\" he says."}

A source explained to the outlet on Wednesday, \"You have to be nominated and make a formal application.

A second source told the outlet that the couple has already been made to feel very welcome among the Billionaire's Bunker set, who, Page Six notes, are largely Republican, and the two have already received a number of invitations to dinner.

But obviously that's not measuring an immune response directly – it's using quite a crude measure of how many people have been infected.\" Altmann explains that he wouldn't advise anyone to consider themself safe 14 days after their first dose of the vaccine. \"The graph is just a way of saying 'something is happening',\" he says.\n\nIn a more recent development, an Israeli academic who coordinated the country's Covid-19 response – Professor Nachman Ash – has claimed that a single dose of the vaccine is not as effective as Pfizer originally estimated. However, the comments have been widely criticised.\n\nThere are a number of reasons that it is inappropriate to compare the research, which was conducted by the health organisation Clalit, with the Pfizer study. For one, the Israeli study found that a single dose of the vaccine reduced the number of people testing positive for the virus, i.e. being infected, by 33%, while the Pfizer paper suggested that it would prevent 52% from developing symptoms – they looked at two different things.\n\nIn addition, the data from Clalit has not been made available, or peer-reviewed. It also involved examining the impact of the vaccine just two weeks after people had received it – considered too early to see an immune response – rather than three, as in the Pfizer study. Finally, the research was not a clinical trial, but rather an observational study, which means the results should be viewed with caution.\n\nOxford-AstraZeneca\n\nFor the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, things are a bit different. In a paper published in January, the authors explain that the vaccine offers protection of 64.1% after at least one standard dose. This compares to 70.4% if you've had two full doses, or – oddly – 90% in people who have had one half dose followed by one full dose.\n\nA month later, AstraZeneca revealed the results of a first analysis of their phase III trial data in a press release. Starting from 22 days after the first dose, the vaccine provided 70% protection against mild or moderate illness and 100% against severe disease, hospitalisation and death.\n\nBecause the phase three trial included two gaps between the first and the second dose – including one of six weeks and a longer one of 12 weeks – it's possible to say with more certainty that the first dose can continue to provide some protection for at least a few months before the booster shot."}

In fact, he's been more late-game clutch than overall dominant, even in winning four Super Bowl MVPs.\n\nHere is our ranking of his first nine Super Bowl performances:\n\n1. Super Bowl LI: Patriots 34, Falcons 28 (2016)\n\nIt was on pace to be Brady's worst Super Bowl in the third quarter, when the Patriots trailed 28-3 and the quarterback's most noteworthy play was throwing a pick-six. But he orchestrated the biggest Super Bowl comeback in the first one ever to go to overtime by completing 43-of-62 passes for 466 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nBrady completed third-down passes to three different receivers on the game-tying 91-yard touchdown drive — then capped it with a must-have 2-point conversion pass. The halftime adjustment to target 1-on-1 coverage outside the numbers was brilliant.\n\n2. Super Bowl XLIX: Patriots 28, Seahawks 24 (2014)\n\nYou remember Malcolm Butler's goal-line interception, but did you forget the Patriots' 10-point fourth-quarter comeback?\n\nUndeterred by the dark cloud of Deflategate and an unthinkable decade-long championship drought, Brady was 37-of-50 for 328 yards and four touchdowns with two interceptions. But he was 13-of-15 for 124 yards with two touchdowns in the fourth quarter against the NFL's top-ranked defense, anchored by its secondary.\n\n3. Super Bowl LII: Eagles 41, Patriots 33 (2017)\n\nLike the only other quarterback ever to throw for 500 yards in the playoffs — Ben Roethlisberger, three weeks ago — Brady lost. Unlike Roethlisberger, Brady wasn't piling up meaningless stats.\n\nBrady took shots down the field in completing 28-of-48 passes for 505 yards — including 237 yards while throwing under pressure — and three touchdowns with no interceptions. But he was strip-sacked by Brandon Graham in the closing minutes of a shootout.\n\n4. Super Bowl XXXVIII: Patriots 32, Panthers 29 (2003)\n\nGraduation day! The end of knocking Brady as a game-manager came when he led two scoring drives in the final four minutes of the first half and two more in the final three minutes of the second half. He threw for 354 yard and three touchdowns — one of which claimed the lead with three minutes to go — on a then-record 32 completions.\n\nAfter the Panthers tied the score with 68 seconds left, Brady set up Adam Vinatieri in range for the winning field goal.\n\n5. Super Bowl XXXVI: Patriots 20, Rams 17 (2001)\n\nWho is this guy? He was the backup who replaced Drew Bledsoe early that season.\n\nBrady's final numbers were those of a caretaker: 16-of-27 for 145 yards with one touchdown and no interceptions. But his legend was born in the final 90 seconds, when the great broadcaster John Madden suggested the Patriots should play for overtime. Brady completed five passes — including a 23-yarder to Troy Brown — to set up the last-second field goal.\n\n6. Super Bowl XXXIX: Patriots 24, Eagles 21 (2004)\n\nThe win that cemented the dynasty.\n\nDonovan McNabb had the gaudy stats (357 yards, three touchdowns) but made the mistakes (three interceptions) his counterpart did not. Linebacker Mike Vrabel caught one of Brady's two touchdown passes, and favorite target Deion Branch exploded for 11 catches, 133 yards and MVP honors.\n\n7.

It will be the couple's first interview since since stepping back from their royal duties in early 2020, but it could also mark the moment that the Sussexes evolve from British royalty to Hollywood elite.\n\n\"Having a big interview with these royals, or ex-royals, and having it done by Oprah Winfrey, begs the question – as it always does – who is the bigger star here, the interviewer or the interviewees?\" said Robert Thompson, a professor of TV and film at the Newhouse School at Syracuse University.\n\nWhile Meghan already had a successful career as an actor and was well known in the US before her marriage to Harry, since their move to the States last year the couple have dominated drugstore magazines and online gossip sites, all obsessed with tracking their lives in California as well as every twist and turn of their rifts with the royal family, which appeared to deepen even further this week.\n\nWhile some in the UK have been concerned over the timing of the interview, as Prince Philip remains in hospital, commentators in the US have mainly focused on the claims that the palace appeared to be attempting a \"smear\" campaign prior to it airing, and the further revelations that could be in store.\n\n\"You've said some pretty shocking things here,\" Winfrey says to the pair in one teaser clip from the two-hour interview released this week.\n\n\"How do you feel about the palace hearing you speak your truth today?\" Winfrey asks Meghan at the start of another. \"I don't know how they could expect that after all of this time, we would still just be silent,\" Meghan responds.\n\nHaving secured lucrative deals with Netflix and Spotify that will finance their new independent lives, the couple have been speaking out on a range of hot-button issues in the US, from racism and police brutality following the killing of George Floyd to voting rights.\n\nA January cover story in People magazine credited the \"progressive\" couple with having \"changed the royal family forever\" and continuing to \"shake up the monarchy\" while settling into their California lives with their young son, Archie.\n\nIn the interview, Britain, as well as the couple, will be under the microscope.

Reports of outages and disruptions began pouring in at about 11:30 EST on Monday - but Facebook's loss turned into gain for other platforms. With Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp all facing disruptions, Twitter is where all the action was on Monday. From Instagram head Adam Mosseri to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, everyone flocked to the microblogging platform as the Facebook-owned services shut out its users.\n\nSignal, the private messaging app endorsed by Edward Snowden, saw millions of people signing up as WhatsApp faced a prolonged downtime, according to Bloomberg. Millions of new users joined the app on Monday, Signal announced on Twitter. The messaging service also received an endorsement from Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. Responding to a tweet from Edward Snowden urging people to switch to Signal from WhatsApp, Mr Dorsey quipped: \"Signal is WhatsUp.\"\n\nDowndetector, a service that monitors reports of outages, said the Facebook service outage is the largest it has ever seen. The outage prompted an apology from Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg and a slew of memes and jokes on Twitter, with the official account of the microblogging platform itself joined the meme-fest.\n\n\"Sorry for the disruption today -- I know how much you rely on our services to stay connected with the people you care about,\" Mark Zuckerberg said on Tuesday as services began returning online. \"Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger are coming back online now,\" he said in his post.\n\nMeanwhile, Instagram head Adam Mosseri confirmed that it was a tough day at work as millions of users failed to access the photo and video sharing platform.\n\nWhen one Twitter user suggested \"Instagram should stay offline forever\", Mr Mosseri responded: \"Them fighting words... but it does feel like a snow day.\"\n\nSeveral Facebook employees told New York Times technology reporter Ryan Mac that they were unable to work due to the outage. \"No one can do any work.

(AP) — An Illinois man who shot three people during a protest over police brutality in Wisconsin last year was justified because the men confronted him and two of them tried to wrestle his gun away, a use-of-force expert called by the defense testified at a pretrial hearing Tuesday.\n\nThe expert, John Black, spent hours outlining the moments that led to Kyle Rittenhouse's decisions to shoot Joseph Rosenbaum, Anthony Huber and Gaige Grosskreutz, offering a preview of the defense team's strategy when Rittenhouse's trial begins next month. Black testified that video shows Rosenbaum chasing Rittenhouse and reaching for the teenager's gun, Huber attacking Rittenhouse with a skateboard and trying to wrestle away his gun, and Grosskreutz running at him with a pistol in his hand.\n\n\"A citizen in that position, given those indicators, would it be reasonable for them to believe they were about to be assaulted?\" Black said. \"I would argue yes.\"\n\nRittenhouse was 17 years old when he made the short trip from his home in Antioch, Illinois, to Kenosha on the night of Aug. 25, 2020, in response to a call from a Kenosha militia to help protect businesses from protesters. The city was in the throes of several nights of chaotic demonstrations sparked by a white police officer's decision to shoot Jacob Blake, a Black man, during a domestic disturbance. The shooting left Blake paralyzed from the waist down.\n\nShortly before midnight, Rittenhouse shot Rosenbaum with an AR-style semiautomatic rifle in the parking lot of a used car dealership, killing him. Moments later, he shot Huber in the street, killing him as well. Seconds after shooting Huber he shot Grosskreutz, wounding him in the arm.\n\nProsecutors have charged Rittenhouse with multiple counts, including homicide, attempted homicide and being a minor in possession of a firearm. Rittenhouse's attorneys say he fired in self-defense. His trial is slated to begin Nov. 1.\n\nRittenhouse's lead attorney, Mark Richards, is trying to persuade Kenosha County Circuit Judge Bruce Schroeder to let Black testify at the trial. Schroeder allowed Black to speak at the hearing via Zoom in hopes that would help him make a decision.\n\nBlack testified that he studied bystander video of the three shootings extensively. He noted that Rosenbaum was chasing Rittenhouse and threw a plastic bag at him before reaching for Rittenhouse's rifle.\n\n\"Now the firearm is a potential weapon for both parties,\" Black said. \"Now we have a potential wrestling match.\"\n\nBystander video showed that after Rittenhouse shot Rosenbaum, he ran down the street. At one point he stumbled and a man came out of the crowd and kicked him in the face, Black said. Rittenhouse fired at that man but missed."}

Many have been quick to say that the incident had to do with BGP, or Border Gateway Protocol, citing sources from inside Facebook, traffic analysis, and the gut instinct that \"it's always DNS or BGP.\" Facebook is back up and has since released an explanation detailing how BGP was just a part of its woes (and saying that it more or less worked as intended), but this all raises the question:\n\nWhat is BGP?\n\nAt a very basic level, BGP is one of the systems that the internet uses to get your traffic to where it needs to go as quickly as possible. Because there are tons of different internet service providers, backbone routers, and servers responsible for your data making it to, say, Facebook, there's a ton of different routes your packets could end up taking. BGP's job is to show them the way and make sure it's the best route.\n\nI've heard BGP described as a system of post offices, an air traffic controller, and more, but I think my favorite explanation was one that likened it to a map. Imagine BGP as a bunch of people making and updating maps that show you how to get to YouTube or Facebook.\n\nBGP is like a map telling your computer whose bridges it has to cross to get to Facebook\n\nWhen it comes to BGP, the internet is broken up into big networks, known as autonomous systems. You can sort of imagine them as island nations — they're networks that are controlled by a single entity, which could be an ISP, like Comcast, a company, like Facebook, or some other big organization like a government or major university. It would be extremely difficult to build bridges connecting every island to all the others, so BGP is what's responsible for telling you which islands (or autonomous systems) you have to go through to get to your destination.\n\nSince the internet is always changing, the maps need to be updated — you don't want your ISP to lead you down an old road that no longer goes to Google. Because it'd be a massive undertaking to map the entire internet all the time, autonomous systems share their maps. They'll occasionally talk to their island neighbors to see and copy any updates they've made to their maps.\n\nTurn left into the river\n\nUsing maps as a framework, it's easy to imagine how things can go wrong. Back when consumers first got access to GPS, there were always jokes about it having you drive off a cliff or into the middle of the desert. The same thing can happen with BGP — if someone makes a mistake, it can end up leading traffic somewhere it's not supposed to go, which will cause problems. If it isn't caught, that mistake will end up on everyone's map. There are other ways this can go wrong, but we'll get to those in a bit.\n\nYeah, yeah, maps. Give me an example.\n\nOf course! This is massively simplified, but imagine you want to connect to an imaginary tech news website called Convergence. Convergence uses the ISP NetSend, and you use DecadeConnect. In this example, DecadeConnect and NetSend can't talk directly to each other, but your ISP can talk to Border Communications, which can talk to Form, which can talk to NetSend. If that's the only route, then BGP would make sure that you and Convergence could communicate through it. But if alternatively, both DecadeConnect and NetSend were connected to ThirdLevel, BGP would likely choose to route your traffic through it, as it's a shorter hop.\n\nOkay, so BGP is like maps that detail all the fastest ways from you to a website?\n\nRight! Unfortunately, it can get even more complicated because the shortest doesn't always equal best. There are plenty of reasons why a routing algorithm would choose one path over another — cost can be a factor as well, with some networks charging others if they want to include them in their routes.\n\nMapping unchanging roads is hard; imagine mapping the internet\n\nAlso, maps are super tricky! I discovered this just recently trying to plan a trip where roads existed on one map and not another or were different between maps. One road even had three different names across three maps. If it's that hard to pin down for a \"town\" that has all of five roads, imagine what it's like trying to connect the entire internet together. Real roads don't change that often, but websites can move from one country to another or change, add, or subtract service providers, and the internet just has to deal with it.\n\nI remember something like this from my algorithms and data structures class — trying to build algos to find the shortest route.\n\nI'll take your word on that. I dropped out as soon as I heard about graphs."}

In an early excerpt from the book (which is set to be released September 1) published by Us Weekly, Dennison said that \"Elizabeth was hurt and disappointed\" by the Sussexes' decision but she didn't let that affect her monarchy-first mindset.\n\n\"Elizabeth's official statement expressed loving finality: 'It is my whole family's hope that today's agreement allows them to start building a happy and peaceful new life.' It was an attempt to reassert control in the interests of damage limitation and a decisive but dark beginning to a new decade,\" Dennison writes. \"Elizabeth had never been a sentimental woman; she had acted in the only way she understood.\"\n\nDennison also included a little context (you know, for any royal readers out there who haven't seen season 1 of The Crown) and explained why the Queen forced Harry and Meghan to make a clean break from royal duties instead of letting them continue to do some engagements.\n\n\"As throughout a life in which she had consistently honored her father's belief that 'the highest of distinctions is the service of others,' she had placed the monarchy first, safeguarding its mission of service and duty that could never, she was certain, be a part-time calling,\" he writes in the excerpt.\n\nOf course, it should go without saying (but maybe doesn't, so here we are, saying it explicitly) that \"putting the monarchy first\" and \"still loving and supporting Harry and Meghan\" are not mutually exclusive, and the Queen has made it abundantly clear that the latter is very much the case several times since the royal exit."}

Here's why\n\nThousands of Americans living abroad received stimulus checks during the Covid-19 pandemic, according to federal data. While that may sound incongruous with the notion of \"stimulus\" for the U.S. economy, lawmakers generally had a sound rationale for sending funds overseas, according to tax policy experts. \"They are casting a very broad net and [payments may] go to places where people think, 'Did they really need to go there?'\" said Kyle Pomerleau, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning think tank. \"But I think the answer is generally, 'Yes.'\" More from Invest in You:\n\nThese companies have a 4-day workweek. Here's what they've learned\n\nHere are the 5 most valuable — and 5 least valuable — college majors\n\nMake these financial and career moves before you quit your job The IRS issued more than 3.7 million payments worth $5.5 billion to individuals outside the 50 states and Washington, D.C., according to agency statistics. The figures include three rounds of pandemic-era payments through June 3, 2021. (Additional payments may have been sent since then.) The data encompasses U.S. citizens abroad, military members stationed overseas and residents of U.S. territories such as Puerto Rico. (While U.S. territories aren't \"overseas\" in the sense that foreign countries are, the IRS doesn't report these statistics separately.)\n\nLess than 1%\n\nAbout 9 million U.S. citizens live overseas, according to the U.S. Department of State. It's natural many of them would get checks due to the expansive eligibility framework set by Congress, Pomerleau said. The scope of the overseas payments is also small relative to the total — 0.7% and 0.8%, respectively, of the $803 billion and 472 million payments issued over three rounds of funding. \"The scale of the payments going overseas is less than 1% of the [total],\" Pomerleau said. \"It wasn't really very much when you look at it.\"\n\nCongress authorized the IRS to send stimulus checks three times during the pandemic: in March 2020 (up to $1,200 a person), last December ($600) and this past March ($1,400). The funds are technically advance payments of a refundable tax credit (the recovery rebate credit). The advance payments are called Economic Impact Payments — the legislative terminology for what Americans have come to call \"stimulus checks.\" But the term \"stimulus checks\" is somewhat of a misnomer, according to tax policy experts. The term implies lawmakers aimed to stimulate demand for goods and services in the U.S. economy by sending money to households. But it seems Congress' primary intent was to buoy household finances at a time of mass unemployment and financial hardship, according to policy experts."}

So I know the recipe for it. I've just got to get to a point where I feel comfortable enough where I can do that again.\"\n\nThe parallels between Hogan's accident in 1949 and Woods' accident this year are numerous, including the fact that both accidents happened in February. And through Woods' own words this week, there is another parallel. Woods won't be a full-time golfer again, which was true of Hogan after his accident.\n\nHogan's car was hit head-on by a bus on a foggy Texas road on Feb. 2, 1949. Hogan had played four tournaments that year, including wins in the Bing Crosby Pro-Am and the Long Beach Open and a second in the Phoenix Open.\n\nHogan's body was badly broken in the accident, including two breaks in his pelvis, a broken leg, broken ribs, a broken collarbone and more. He also fought blood clots that nearly killed him three months after the accident.\n\nHogan miraculously returned to competitive golf in 1950, playing nine tournaments and winning three times, including the U.S. Open. But those nine tournaments would be the most he ever played in a single year again. The 1950 U.S. Open was one of six majors Hogan won after his accident. Three of those majors came in 1953, when he won the Masters, the U.S. Open and the British Open among his eight starts.\n\nLimited play because of injuries\n\nBut Hogan played just four tournaments in 1954 and another four in 1955. His badly damaged legs wouldn't allow him much more at the time.\n\nWoods has hardly been a full-time player in recent years, with back surgeries cutting down his play to just nine tournaments in the 2020 calendar year, including one unofficial start in the made-for-television The Match. He hasn't played any tournaments since the 2020 Masters played in November.\n\nWoods saying he will never be a top-level player again was hardly news, because he wasn't one of the top players in the game when he had his accident. In fact for the week of Feb. 28 this year, Woods was just 53rd in the Official World Golf Rankings. The accident and the damage to his already ailing body certainly had fans understanding that Woods was never going to be peak Tiger Woods again."}

(AP) — The wind ripped chunks off the hospital's roof and the entire building rumbled. One nurse said the cement pounding into the walls sounded like the loudest bowling alley she could imagine. Another felt like she was inside a meteor shower.\n\nOne of the most powerful hurricanes in the nation's history was barreling into south Louisiana. Fifty miles (80 kilometers) southwest of New Orleans, the staff at Leonard J. Chabert Medical Center in Houma was already weary from a year and a half of caring for patients with COVID-19.\n\nNow water was pouring from the ceiling tiles. A giant metal beam tore off the building and thumped into a glass door, over and over, like a battering ram. The medical staff prepared to keep patients on ventilators alive by hand if the worst were to happen.\n\nHurricane Ida was colliding with the country's out-of-control pandemic. Hospitals facing a Category 4 storm typically either evacuate or discharge as many patients as possible. But this time, amid the community's fourth, brutal surge of COVID, many of Chabert Medical Center's patients were too sick to be sent home. And hospitals that lay outside the hurricane's most destructive path were too full of COVID patients to absorb any more. So here they stayed — nurses, doctors, paramedics — exhausted from battling one catastrophe, watching through the windows as a second one tore into town with 150 mph (240 kph) winds.\n\n\"The mental stress on our employees is much worse now than it's ever been,\" said Richard Zuschlag, the owner of Acadian Ambulance Service, the state's largest emergency medical outfit. \"COVID set us up for that. And the hurricane is the icing on the cake.\"\n\nSome nurses wept. The staff stood in a hallway, held hands and asked God to protect them. They feared any minute the building might collapse.\n\nAcross town, huge sections of the roof blew off Terrebonne General Health System, the largest hospital in Terrebonne Parish, whose bayous brimming with sinewy cypress trees run through the region like veins. Water poured in so quickly it looked like it was raining inside. The windows shattered, the walls shook and it sounded like a freight train.\n\nAs the hours passed, some nurses began asking the same question about the storm that they'd been pondering about the pandemic for months: \"When is this ever going to end?\"\n\nBy the time the sun came up, both hospitals in Houma had endured so much damage, they had to coordinate a massive evacuation.\n\nDr. Chuck Burnell, the chief medical officer of Acadian Ambulance, was in the basement of Terrebonne General sorting out how to move more than 100 patients, many of them infected with COVID, some on ventilators.\n\nBurnell has been an emergency physician for almost 30 years, and he said this is among the worst storms he's been through, arriving as it did just as the state's COVID deaths soared and its vaccination rate remained among the lowest in the country."}

His four-year tenure in the White House revealed extraordinary fissures in American society but left little doubt that he is a figure unlike any other in the nation's history.\n\nTrump, the New York businessman and former reality TV show star, won the 2016 election after a campaign that defied norms and commanded public attention from the moment it began. His approach to governing was equally unconventional.\n\nOther presidents tried to unify the nation after turning from the campaign trail to the White House. From his first days in Washington to his last, Trump seemed to revel in the political fight. He used his presidential megaphone to criticize a long list of perceived adversaries, from the news media to members of his own administration, elected officials in both political parties and foreign heads of state. The more than 26,000 tweets he sent as president provided an unvarnished, real-time account of his thinking on a broad spectrum of issues and eventually proved so provocative that Twitter permanently banned him from its platform. In his final days in office, Trump became the first president ever to be impeached twice – the second time for inciting an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol during the certification of the election he lost – and the nation's first chief executive in more than 150 years to refuse to attend his successor's inauguration.\n\nTrump's policy record included major changes at home and abroad. He achieved a string of long-sought conservative victories domestically, including the biggest corporate tax cuts on record, the elimination of scores of environmental regulations and a reshaping of the federal judiciary. In the international arena, he imposed tough new immigration restrictions, withdrew from several multilateral agreements, forged closer ties with Israel and launched a tit-for-tat trade dispute with China as part of a wider effort to address what he saw as glaring imbalances in America's economic relationship with other countries.\n\nMany questions about Trump's legacy and his role in the nation's political future will take time to answer. But some takeaways from his presidency are already clear from Pew Research Center's studies in recent years. In this essay, we take a closer look at a few of the key societal shifts that accelerated – or emerged for the first time – during the tenure of the 45th president.\n\nHow we did this This examination of how the United States changed during Donald Trump's presidency is based on an analysis of public opinion survey data from Pew Research Center, administrative data from government agencies, news reports and other sources. Links to the original sources of data – including the field dates, sample sizes and methodologies of individual surveys by the Center – are included wherever possible. Unless otherwise noted, all references to Republicans and Democrats in this analysis include independents who lean to each party.\n\nDeeply partisan and personal divides\n\nTrump's status as a political outsider, his outspoken nature and his willingness to upend past customs and expectations of presidential behavior made him a constant focus of public attention, as well as a source of deep partisan divisions.\n\nEven before he took office, Trump divided Republicans and Democrats more than any incoming chief executive in the prior three decades. The gap only grew more pronounced after he became president. An average of 86% of Republicans approved of Trump's handling of the job over the course of his tenure, compared with an average of just 6% of Democrats – the widest partisan gap in approval for any president in the modern era of polling. Trump's overall approval rating never exceeded 50% and fell to a low of just 29% in his final weeks in office, shortly after a mob of his supporters attacked the Capitol.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats weren't just divided over Trump's handling of the job. They also interpreted many aspects of his character and personality in fundamentally opposite ways. In a 2019 survey, at least three-quarters of Republicans said the president's words sometimes or often made them feel hopeful, entertained, informed, happy and proud. Even larger shares of Democrats said his words sometimes or often made them feel concerned, exhausted, angry, insulted and confused."}

If administrators were doing their jobs, faculty and students would freely air a wide variety of viewpoints and have opportunities to better understand one another's diverse perspectives. Instead, many administrators are preemptively imposing their preferred narratives.\n\nThe Rittenhouse saga began in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on August 25, amid rioting that followed the police shooting of a Black man. Rittenhouse, then 17, armed himself with an AR-15-style rifle and walked into the chaos, claiming that he intended to protect the community. He wound up shooting three men, killing two. Last week, a Wisconsin jury found him not guilty of murder, crediting his claim that, at the moment he fired, he feared for his life and acted in self-defense. This, many analysts argued, was a plausible conclusion to draw from Wisconsin law and video footage and testimony presented at trial.\n\nAdam Serwer: Of course Kyle Rittenhouse was acquitted\n\nMore than 2,000 miles away, administrators at UC Santa Cruz felt otherwise. Chancellor Cynthia Larive and Interim Chief Diversity Officer Judith Estrada issued a statement that began like this:\n\nWe are disheartened and dismayed by this morning's not guilty verdict on all charges in the trial of Kyle Rittenhouse ... We join in solidarity with all who are outraged by this failure of accountability.\n\nUC Santa Cruz is a public institution with roughly 19,000 students and 1,000 instructors who, one can safely say, do not all share the same viewpoints. But Larive and Estrada emphasized their personal feelings and openly pledged solidarity (meaning \"unity or agreement of feeling or action,\" by one definition) with others based on whether they too feel angry. This is posturing, not engagement with a campus community. I wrote to Larive and asked her to clarify why the jury should have found Rittenhouse guilty, if that's what she meant by \"failure of accountability.\" A university spokesperson, Scott Hernandez-Jason, responded, \"The campus message speaks for itself.\"\n\nIndeed, it does. America has never known a time without sensational murder trials that seize the public's attention and inflame passions. I have an old-fashioned answer to how a university should behave in these cases: It should stay neutral and promote reasoned analysis and debate. But Larive and Estrada made a different choice. And they aren't the only university leaders who have done so in the days since the verdict. Rather than encourage independent scrutiny, administrators on many campuses have issued statements that presuppose answers to hotly contested questions, and assert opinions about the not-guilty verdict in the case and its ostensible significance as though they were matters of community consensus."}

The Southwest Power Pool, a group of utilities across 14 states, called for rolling outages because the supply of reserve energy had been exhausted. Some utilities said they were starting blackouts, while others urged customers to reduce power usage.\n\n\"We're living through a really historic event going on right now,\" said Jason Furtado, a professor of meteorology at the University of Oklahoma, pointing to all of Texas under a winter storm warning and the extent of the freezing temperatures.\n\nIn Houston, where county leaders had warned that the freeze could create problems on the scale of massive hurricanes that slam the Gulf Coast, one electric provider said power may not be restored to some homes until Tuesday.\n\n\"This weather event, it's really unprecedented. We all living here know that,\" said Dan Woodfin, senior director of system operations at the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. He defended preparations made by grid operators and described the demand on the system as record-setting.\n\n\"This event was well beyond the design parameters for a typical, or even an extreme, Texas winter that you would normally plan for. And so that is really the result that we're seeing,\" Woodfin said.\n\nThe largest grocery store chain in Texas, H-E-B, closed locations around Austin and San Antonio, cities that are unaccustomed to snow and have little resources to clear roads. The slow thaw and more frigid lows ahead was also taking a toll on Texas' distribution of COVID-19 vaccines."}

It embraced Trump's view instead.\n\nColin L. Powell had kept the political world guessing: Was he a Democrat or a Republican? At a packed news conference in November 1995, dominated by speculation about a presidential bid for the trailblazing four-star general, Powell delivered the big reveal: He was a Republican. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight That announcement was overshadowed by his other news, that he wouldn't seek the presidency, clearing the way for Sen. Bob Dole (Kan.) to seize the GOP nomination and removing a challenge to President Bill Clinton (D). But Powell used that very public moment to lay out his vision for the Republican Party and what the first Black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff hoped to accomplish.\n\n\"I believe I can help the party of Lincoln move once again close to the spirit of Lincoln,\" Powell said in a tacit rebuke of GOP ideologues who opposed racial diversity and extending a welcoming hand to immigrants.\n\nHis vision for the Republican Party, however, never materialized. Instead, it swiftly and surely moved toward Donald Trump's political worldview, a party warning of immigrants replacing White Americans, one wary and sometimes mocking of international engagement and willing to embrace a populism that has divided the nation. Powell, the hero of the 1991 Persian Gulf War who once was heralded as the next Dwight D. Eisenhower, became an outlier in the party.\n\nIn 2008, he endorsed Barack Obama, the first Black president, and later backed Democratic presidential candidates, soundly rejecting Trump. In January, after a pro-Trump mob stormed the U.S. Capitol, Powell said he could \"no longer call himself a Republican.\"\n\nThe divorce seemed inevitable for a never-Trumper often described as a RINO — Republican in name only — by the party faithful, some of whom had once promoted him as a possible presidential nominee, a Black Republican in a GOP struggling for diversity.\n\n\"He certainly is one of the greatest political what-ifs,\" said Douglas Heye, a former Republican National Committee communications director who served as deputy chief of staff to former House majority leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.), referring to Powell's potential as a leader of a modern GOP. \"It highlights the fact that people like him were turning away in part because of some of that increased — especially racial — rhetoric that was acceptable in too many parts of the Republican Party.\""}

(WLBT) - If you missed a few of the most important headlines and need to play catch up, no worries. WLBT has gathered some of the top stories from our website to get you up to speed.\n\n1. Weekend homicides\n\nJackson Police Department (WLBT)\n\nThe Jackson Police Department is investigating a shooting that occurred around 10:30 p.m. Saturday. According to police, Antoinette Robinson was shot multiple times while sitting inside her Nissan Altima at Winter Street and Dalton Street. Deputy Chief Deric Hearn says Robinson was transported to UMMC, where she died.\n\nThree people were also found dead around 12:30 a.m. Sunday. Jackson Police Department Spokesperson Sam Brown says officers responded to a shooting in the 800 block of Britton Street. According to Brown, once officers arrived, they discovered 43-year-old Jessie Bullock, 56-year-old James Bullock, and 60-year-old Colleen Bullock dead from gunshot wounds.\n\n2. Changes for Mississippi judicial races\n\nPoliticians running for governor, attorney general or many other Mississippi offices are free to make all sorts of promises about what they'll do if elected. Judicial candidates are supposed to be much more reserved, according to the Mississippi Code of Judicial Conduct. They can promise to be fair, but they cannot pledge specific outcomes on particular types of cases. That doesn't stop outside groups from spending money — sometimes piles of money — to promote one judicial candidate or disparage another. Under change recently made by a majority of the Mississippi Supreme Court, the public could receive less information about findings of unethical behavior during judicial campaigns. For years, Mississippi has had a committee to keep an eye on races for Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, chancery court, circuit court and county court judges. The committee was created because of concerns about the increasing amount of money flowing into the state to influence the elections, especially for the top courts. In an order issued Nov. 30, the state Supreme Court revised the committee's size and scope of operations. Instead of having a five-person committee that serves for a single election year, the state now has a nine-person committee that serves for multiple years."}

And sitting Secretary of State Anthony Blinken delivered formal remarks recalling how kindly Powell had treated career diplomats and what a mentor Powell had been to many.\n\nThere was nothing from the immediate past president, Donald Trump – not even a brief, rote statement of condolence.

He made plenty of mistakes, but anyway, may he rest in peace!\"\n\nRepublicans aligned with Trump or that wing of the party toed the line, not going so far as to openly insult Powell, but by remaining quiet or putting out brief and impersonal statements of condolence. Only a handful – such as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who angered Trump when the Kentucky Republican said Trump was morally responsible for the Jan. 6 insurrection – made more effusive remarks .\n\nThis is the new mourning in America, where even the death of a widely admired and barrier-breaking military and diplomatic leader has been reduced to a political talking point. And while the deaths of politicians have been used as partisan platforms before, Trump, experts say, has taken it to a new level.\n\n\"Their silence is a measure of their cowardice\" in failing to praise Powell along with Democrats and Republicans who are not Trump-aligned, says Mac Stipanovich, a veteran Republican political strategist in Florida who now considers himself an independent.\n\n\"They are so afraid of his MAGA myrmidons that they would rather pass up the opportunity to laud a man of the stature of Colin Powell, who richly deserves their praise, particularly in the Republican Party, than run any risk on incurring the disappointment – not even the wrath – of Donald Trump,\" Stipanovich adds."}

Andrew Cuomo, and the role the cable network star played in advising the governor through his political crisis and how the network will handle one of the biggest stories of the year going forward.\n\nCuomo will likely keep his job, say Northeastern journalism faculty experts Dan Kennedy and Mike Beaudet, even as media watchdog groups and others have called for him to step down or be fired for his involvement with the matter. They say network management and Chris Cuomo himself share blame for a \"messy situation\" that blurred personal and professional lines between the anchor and his embattled sibling.\n\nCNN hasn't said anything publicly about Cuomo's status since more information came to light last week about his role in helping Gov.

The Cuomo Prime Time host was expected to be in his usual 9 p.m. EDT slot on Monday between Anderson Cooper 360 at 8 p.m. EDT and Don Lemon Tonight airing at 10 p.m. EDT.\n\nCuomo's job with CNN \"appears to be safe at the moment,\" says Beaudet. \"But,\" he cautions, \"this is an evolving situation.\"\n\nKennedy adds that disciplinary action is not likely to materialize unless Cuomo's boss, CNN President Jeff Zucker, is punished as well, \"and that's not going to happen.\"\n\nChris Cuomo was interviewed as part of the New York attorney general's investigation and testified that he encouraged his brother to show remorse, and had a hand in writing public statements―actions that raised questions about journalistic boundaries.\n\n\"CNN needs to commission a report of its own to determine just how its star anchor fit into this sexual harassment pushback effort,'\" wrote Washington Post media critic Erik Wemple.\n\nChris Cuomo acknowledged that it was a mistake and has apologized on air.

If the firm did not pay to decrypt it, the data would be \"automatically published\" online, the hackers said, according to the note, which was shared with The Washington Post by the firm that helped the victim deal with the attack.\n\nOn Wednesday, the company paid $850,000, according to Austin Berglas, the former head of the cyber branch in the FBI's New York field office who is now global head of professional services for the cyber security firm BlueVoyant.\n\n\"In this case,\" he said, \"they had no option.\" If they didn't pay, he said, \"they would go out of business.\"\n\nThe firm's dilemma is faced by thousands of companies, schools, governments, and other entities around the world every year. Most incidents go unreported. Anecdotally, according to companies that help victims hit by ransomware attacks, more than half pay some form of ransom — estimated last year to average about $312,000, according to Palo Alto Networks, another cybersecurity company that deals regularly with ransomware attacks. Some experts suspect that amount is low.\n\nThe attack that led Colonial Pipeline to shut down its 5,500-mile pipeline, causing fuel shortages throughout the southeastern United States, underscored that the ballooning ransomware wave isn't just about money. Targeting the private businesses that run much of the economy also threatens national security.\n\nPresident Biden on Thursday announced that the U.S. government had \"strong reason to believe\" the criminals behind the attack lived in Russia, though he said he did not believe the Russian government had directed the assault. Nonetheless, he warned Moscow about the need to \"take decisive action\" against them. The Justice Department, he said, would step up prosecutions of ransomware hackers and the government will \"pursue a measure to disrupt their ability to operate.\"\n\nShortly after Biden's comments, DarkSide, the hacker ring behind the Colonial strike, told its criminal partners that it had lost control of its computer servers and was shutting down. Some experts and U.S. officials warned this could be an \"exit scam,\" to pretend they were leaving the business only to reappear at a later date under a different name. In any case, it is unlikely to end the risk from ransomware attacks.\n\nOne thing is certain. DarkSide had a profitable quarter. The ring collected $14 million in ransoms for all of 2020 and raked in $46 million in just the first three months of this year, according to an analysis by Chainalysis.\n\nColonial told U.S. officials it was not planning to pay ransom, according to three people familiar with the matter, but one person later said the company changed course. The Washington Post previously reported that the company had no plan to pay a ransom. Industry analysts, based on circumstantial evidence in an online ledger that tracks cryptocurrency payments, say they believe Colonial made a $5 million payment. Colonial has declined to say.

To date, the focus has been on how a stimulus package will impact consumer spending, but it is not clear how President Joe Biden's proposed $1,400 stimulus check for eligible households will affect Americans' ability to pay their bills.\n\nConventional economic data such as gross domestic product and high-frequency consumer spending data both measure economic output. Similarly, aggregate personal saving data offers no insight into the distribution of savings across the population. While these data sources offer important insight into the likely impact of fiscal spending on the economy, they only tell part of the story.\n\nTo assess the impact, amount and eligibility of a third stimulus package, Morning Consult analyzed its proprietary tracking data on household finances, which offers insight into the current condition of households' balance sheets.\n\nUsing this data, this analysis argues that a third round of $1,400 stimulus checks more narrowly targeted to low-income adults and parents combined with enhancements to the country's unemployment benefit system would prevent unnecessary financial hardship and mitigate future economic risks.\n\n$1,400 would help many Americans avoid financial hardship through July\n\nThe purpose of fiscal spending during a recession is not only to boost short-term economic activity; it's also to provide financially vulnerable households with enough money to avoid unnecessary financial harm. As a society, delinquencies and defaults are inefficient and costly uses of resources, and financial uncertainty prevents families from investing in their futures. During recessions, it's cheaper for the country as a whole to keep people out of financial trouble than it is helping them fight their way back."}

Those arguments were enumerated on a whiteboard.\n\n\"I absolutely wanted to make sure that everyone was on the same page,\" Belton Hardeman said. \"I wanted to make sure that we were doing due diligence and that we actually understood what our task was. There was no room for error at all.\"\n\nThere were about four votes on the second count before agreement was reached on guilty. They watched the video and went through reams of notes and testimony to answer questions such as: How many times was Floyd's pulse checked? What did the officers say to one another?\n\nJodi Doud posed another question: \"Wait a minute. Does the intended act of harm have to be the death of George Floyd, or can it be him not providing the life support?\"\n\n\"All of a sudden light bulbs just went on for those people I think that were undecided or on the not guilty side,\" Deters said.\n\n\"This is not what he did but more or less what he didn't do,\" Doud added, referring to Chauvin. \"He did not provide life saving measures for George Floyd when he knew that the guy was in pain or needed medical attention.\"\n\nDeters was a holdout – either for not guilty or undecided – until Doud spoke of intent.\n\n\"I was just kind of, like, 'Oh my gosh, you're totally right,'\" Deters said. \"There is intent ... to not provide lifesaving measures when he knew three times there was no pulse.\"\n\n'Race wasn't even ever mentioned'\n\nIn the jury room, Belton Hardeman said, she recalled testimony about a Minneapolis police motto: \"In our custody, in our care,\" or words to that effect."}

He also cited the presence of children when he committed the crime and the fact Chauvin was part of a group with at least three other people.\n\nCahill said Chauvin and two other officers held Floyd handcuffed, in a prone position on the street for an \"inordinate amount of time\" and that Chauvin knew the restraint was dangerous.\n\n\"The prolonged use of this technique was particularly egregious in that George Floyd made it clear he was unable to breathe and expressed the view that he was dying as a result of the officers' restraint,\" Cahill wrote.\n\nEven with the aggravating factors, legal experts have said, Chauvin, 45, is unlikely to get more than 30 years when he is sentenced June 25.\n\nChauvin, who is white, was convicted in April of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter for pressing his knee against Floyd's neck for 9 1/2 minutes as the Black man said he couldn't breathe and went motionless.\n\nEven though he was found guilty of three counts, under Minnesota statutes he'll only be sentenced on the most serious one — second-degree murder. Under Minnesota sentencing guidelines, he would have faced a presumptive sentence of 12 1/2 years on that count, and Cahill could have sentenced him to as little as 10 years and eight months or as much as 15 years and still stayed within the guideline range.\n\nBut prosecutors asked for what is known as an upward departure — arguing that Floyd was particularly vulnerable with his hands cuffed behind his back as he was face-down on the ground. They noted that Chauvin held his position even after Floyd became unresponsive and officers knew he had no pulse.\n\nWith Tuesday's ruling, Cahill has given himself permission to sentence Chauvin above the guideline range, though he doesn't have to, said Mark Osler, professor at the University of St. Thomas School of Law. He said attorneys for both sides will argue whether an upward departure is appropriate and how long the sentence should be.\n\nA pre-sentence investigation report will also be conducted. These are usually nonpublic and include highly personal information such as family history and mental health issues, as well as details of the offense and the harm it caused others and the community.\n\nIn arguing for the upward departure, prosecutors said Chauvin treated Floyd with particular cruelty during the lengthy restraint, saying Chauvin inflicted gratuitous pain and caused psychological distress to Floyd and to bystanders. They also said Chauvin abused his position of authority as a police officer, committed his crime as part of a group of three or more people, and that he pinned Floyd down in the presence of children — including a 9-year-old girl who testified at trial that watching the restraint made her \"sad and kind of mad.\"\n\nCahill agreed with all but one of the prosecutors' arguments. He said prosecutors did not prove that Floyd was particularly vulnerable, noting that even though he was handcuffed, he was able to struggle with officers who were trying to put him in a squad car.\n\nBut Cahill said one of the other officers twice checked Floyd's pulse and told Chauvin he detected none, while another officer suggested rolling Floyd to his side and said he was passing out. Cahill said these officers let Chauvin know that asphyxia was actually happening — yet Chauvin held his position.\n\nCahill said when it became clear to bystanders that Floyd was in distress and stopped breathing, Chauvin continued to abuse his position of authority by not rendering aid.\n\nIn finding that Chauvin treated Floyd with particular cruelty, Cahill wrote: \"The slow death of George Floyd occurring over approximately six minutes of his positional asphyxia was particularly cruel in that Mr. Floyd was begging for his life and obviously terrified by the knowledge that he was likely to die but during which the Defendant objectively remained indifferent to Mr. Floyd's pleas.\"\n\nDefense attorney Eric Nelson disagreed with the state, saying that prosecutors did not prove that there were aggravating factors. He said Chauvin had legal authority to assist in Floyd's arrest and was authorized under law to use reasonable force. He also said Floyd was not particularly vulnerable, saying he was a large man who was struggling with officers.\n\nNelson also argued Floyd was not treated with particular cruelty, saying that there is no evidence that the assault perpetrated by Chauvin involved gratuitous pain that's not usually associated with second-degree murder.\n\nNo matter what sentence Chauvin gets, in Minnesota it's presumed that a defendant with good behavior will serve two-thirds of the penalty in prison and the rest on supervised release, commonly known as parole.\n\nChauvin has also been indicted on federal charges alleging he violated Floyd's civil rights, as well as the civil rights of a 14-year-old he restrained in a 2017 arrest. If convicted on those charges, which were unsealed Friday, a federal sentence would be served at the same time as Chauvin's state sentence. The three other former officers involved in Floyd's death were also charged with federal civil rights violations; they await trial in state court on aiding and abetting counts."}

He has undergone a long surgical procedure on his lower right leg and ankle after being brought to the hospital.\"\n\nThe statement revealed that the 45-year-old is \"currently awake, responsive, and recovering in his hospital room.\" It also thanked the doctors and staff at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center as well as the Los Angeles County Sheriff's and Fire Departments for their \"outstanding\" support and assistance.\n\n\"Mr. Woods suffered significant orthopaedic injuries to his right lower extremity that were treated during emergency surgery by Orthopaedic trauma specialists at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, a level 1 trauma center,\" the hospital's chief medical officer and interim CEO, Dr. Anish Mahajan, said in a statement. \"Comminuted open fractures affecting both the upper and lower portions of the tibia and fibula bones were stabilized by inserting a rod into the tibia.

Sheriff Alex Villaneuva, meanwhile, told reporters that Woods' vehicle had traveled at \"a relatively greater speed than normal.\"\n\nThe five-time Masters Tournament champion was wearing his seat belt when he crashed, and Villaneuva said the airbags in Woods' car \"gave him the cushion to survive what otherwise would have been a fatal crash.\"\n\nWoods has undergone five back surgeries since 2014, most recently in December 2020.

Leftwich's response, in part, was this:\n\n\"I've got to put these guys in position to do the things that they need to do to give ourselves an opportunity to win the football game.\"\n\nLeftwich shared that thought, in some form or another, many times during the 2020 season, which ended with the Buccaneers hoisting the Lombardi Trophy after a Super Bowl LV victory over Kansas City. Essentially, he's saying that he and the coaching staff have to devise a game plan that would counter the opposing defense's strengths and take advantage of its weaknesses, and then it was up to the players to execute it. Like most coordinators, Leftwich didn't feel the need to share what that game plan was before the game itself took place.\n\nThe Buccaneers had an offensive game plan for the Chiefs now seems very clear in retrospect. It centered on effective play-action fakes and getting the ball out of Tom Brady's hand quickly. Thanks to good execution of that plan by the players, it worked. The result was a smooth and mistake-free offense that, at one point, scored on five of six consecutive drives, with the other one ending at Kansas City's one-yard line. The result was a dominant 31-9 win and the second championship in franchise history.\n\nThe heavy usage of play-action in the passing game was pretty easy to spot during the game and later confirmed by NFL Next Gen Stats. According to Next Gen, Brady executed a play-action fake on 43% of his dropbacks. Next Gen has been tracking this and many other things since 2016 and that is the single-highest rate of play-action usage that Brady has had in a game in that span.\n\nThis was the plan right from the start, and it was a new one. As a team, the Buccaneers either ran the ball or faked a handoff – what Next Gen Stats calls \"run action\" – on 73% of their plays in the first quarter, their highest rate in any game this season. Over the season as a whole, the Bucs used run action on just 48% of their first-quarter plays.\n\nBrady ended up throwing 13 passes after a fake handoff and he completed 10 of them for 135 yards and all three of his touchdowns. Those numbers produce a near-perfect passer rating of 149.0. Obviously, those fakes are meant to move defenders in the wrong direction, and that's exactly what they did. At the point of the catch or incompletion, Brady's targeted pass-catchers had an average of 4.0 yards of separation from the nearest defender. That's the best average separation the Buccaneers got in any game during the entire 2020 season."}

The teen became a hero in Republican corners and a symbol to the left of the rise of white nationalism and armed militia groups.\n\nRittenhouse, 18, fatally shot two men and injured a third with an AR-15 styled rifle during often violent protests in the summer of 2020 following the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Rittenhouse argued he feared for his life and had no choice but to open fire on the men, who were among those protesting. During the trial, prosecutors painted Rittenhouse as a teen vigilante, who wasn't old enough to purchase the rifle he was carrying. They said he incited the shootings and traveled to the city with other during the protests specifically looking for trouble.\n\nThe case and not-guilty-on-all-counts verdict highlighted many of the divisions in the country, and the impact on gun rights and protests could be deep-rooted.\n\n\"Today's Rittenhouse case highlights the deadly consequences of the 'shoot first, ask questions second' mentality,\" said Igor Volsky, co-founder of Guns Down America, a national group that advocates for stricter gun laws. He added on Twitter that the verdict \"will only invite greater political violence at the hands of individuals who believe their guns transform them into untouchable super citizens.\"\n\nOn the flip side of the coin are gun-rights activists such as U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, who says the verdict is an important victory for America.\n\nBoebert, in a text to USA TODAY, said the \"verdict is a win for self defense, a win for the Second Amendment, a win for blind justice and a win for common sense.\" She added, \"if Kyle is looking for an internship, he should reach out.\"\n\nA nation divided on one verdict: Kyle Rittenhouse verdict reactions from 'Justice system broken' to 'Justice system worked'\n\nWill numbers of armed protesters rise after Rittenhouse verdict?\n\nThe number of armed protests across the country was already picking back up, researchers say.

It's been really hard,\" she said. \"I wouldn't want my worst enemy to go through this.\"\n\nBall added she and her husband were vaccine-hesitant, but she eventually got the vaccine under her doctor's care after fears regarding her asthma condition.

CNN via Skype\n\n\"But I didn't get put in here for 22 days and counting,\" she said.\n\nBall said her vaccine skepticism stemmed from not knowing just how badly the virus can affect her.\n\n\"We just didn't know the severity of the disease ... especially, this Delta variant. ... It just hadn't hit that close to home, yet,\" she said.\n\nMississippi has one of the nation's lowest vaccination rates, with 34.4% of the total population fully vaccinated, state data shows.\n\nThe state is also designated as an area with high transmission of Covid-19, according to federal health data. Over the past week, Mississippi saw 336 cases per 100,000 people, which is one of the highest rates in the US.\n\nThe Delta variant of Covid-19 has been spreading throughout the country, compounding concerns among health officials. Safety restrictions and mask guidances are making a return as cases rose by at least 10% in nearly every US state in the last week, according to Johns Hopkins University data.\n\nThe variant spreads quicker and more easily than the first coronavirus strain and can infect fully vaccinated people whose symptoms are usually milder.\n\nBall hopes sharing her Covid-19 experience will encourage her loved ones and others to get vaccinated.\n\n\"God, I hope so.

Wednesday afternoon that \"we're going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue, and we're going to the Capitol,\" they didn't wait. They started to march right away.\n\nEven as Trump continued to speak, I watched them begin to peel off, first a few, and then hundreds. One guy looked at me taking photographs and said, \"It's almost over. We have to get to the Capitol!\"\n\nThey moved quickly. The mood had been lighter earlier in the day, like a Trump-themed Comic-Con. But it darkened fast. Under banners like \"GOD, GUNS, GUTS & GLORY,\" protesters—I was still thinking of them as protesters, not rioters, at that point—screamed at counterprotesters along the side of the street, calling them \"cheaters\" and breaking into a steady, robotic chant of \"TRUMP WON! TRUMP WON!\"\n\nAs we got closer to the Capitol steps, there was some excitement: Fellow marchers had breached the building, people said. I wasn't sure what that meant. As we got closer, though, I saw these marchers ripping open doors and climbing through windows. When I got to the doors, police had managed to close them again. There was a core group of young people at the very front, just outside, trying to force their way in.\n\nThere were a few cops, but not nearly enough. As I approached the door, I identified myself as press, and one cop started using my body to push people behind me backward. I heard one say to the other, \"The best we can do is slow them down.\" I rolled around them and walked straight in.\n\nDirectly inside, I saw no cops. As \"Don't Stop Believin' \" blared from a speaker somewhere, large crowds chanted \"USA! USA!\" A man screamed about the American people's will. The entryway was already messed up. Rioters were smashing the windows, and there was wooden furniture piled up and destroyed. I saw a man in a conference room with his feet up. He and his friends were smoking weed, and when we clocked each other, they offered me a joint.\n\nIn another room, people were lounging and rummaging through furniture. They put up stickers and scrawled slogans like \"Trump Won\" and \"Our House.\" Some invited me to take their picture. One young guy put his feet up on one of the desks, posed, and told me, \"Yeah, this is my desk. I paid for this.\"\n\nAt one point, I'm pretty sure I saw Gavin McInnes, the Proud Boys founder, strolling around inside in military-style gear. Others seemed to notice too: I heard murmurs of \"Hey, it's Gavin.\" (Update, Jan. 7, 2021: McInnes says he was in New York on Wednesday and added: \"I was adamantly against this rally from day one.\") Not long after, a \"Boogaloo Boy\" who wouldn't give me his name shouted at me about currency and the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe mood was giddy, but it was chaos. Everyone was excited. People were chanting, \"This is our America,\" and \"Whose house? Our house!\" They were having fun, entertaining themselves. The priority seemed to be to have their friends take selfies with them inside the Capitol.\n\nThe people I managed to speak to didn't seem to understand the gravity of what they had done. Inside a building they had broken into, they described themselves as \"peaceful\" to me. I talked to a kid from Florida, who must have been no more than 17 or 18. He told me, \"This is nothing compared to what antifa does.\" I said, \"Look, they're breaking the glass.\" He answered, \"Yeah, but at least they're not destroying the things.\" I showed him pictures of things destroyed. It didn't register. On the way up, there was a woman holding a sign saying, \"If we were leftists, we would be rioting.\"\n\nEven amid the \"fun,\" there were some very aggressive rioters. People shouted \"fake news\" and attacked journalists. I saw a group of people scream at a female journalist who had an accent, \"Get out of my country!\" I got away with only one woman incensed I took her picture. I kept the picture and walked away. (I later learned that police shot and killed a woman inside, and there are frightening videos of rioters storming different parts of the building, but I wasn't there for either incident.)\n\nEventually, I did see some cops inside. They seemed to be standing by, waiting for orders. I've been to plenty of protests in the past year, and let me tell you: They don't usually wait for orders. I've never seen anything like it. There was a guy smoking a cigarette, and a cop actually walked over, gently placed his hand on the guy's shoulder, and asked him to put it out. And that was it.\n\nEventually, word must have come down. The cops started to smack through crowds with their batons and push them back. They pepper-sprayed people. Eventually, the officers retook the concourse outside the House side of the Capitol by using percussion grenades and tear gas. They had a fire extinguisher that appeared to be filled with pepper spray that they would explode in people's faces to keep them outside. By then, rioters were using barricades to try to smash back through the doors. They were trashing the place.\n\nOutside again, people were livid with the police. They chanted \"Traitors!\" and told them, \"We had your back. We're on your side!\" But the cops just stood there solemnly in their riot gear."}

He was 84.\n\nPowell, the first Black secretary of state and the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was fully vaccinated, his family said in a post on his Facebook page. But Powell had battled various other health ailments, and had been treated for multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer that affects white blood cells and can severely compromise the immune system. His wife, Alma, also had a breakthrough case of COVID-19, but responded to treatment.\n\n\"We want to thank the medical staff at Walter Reed National Medical Center for their caring treatment,\" the Powell family wrote. \"We have lost a remarkable and loving husband, father, grandfather and a great American.\"\n\nPresident Biden ordered flags flown at half-staff until October 22 in remembrance of Powell, calling him \"a patriot of unmatched honor and dignity.\"\n\n\"As a senator, I worked closely with him when he served as National Security Advisor, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and as Secretary of State. Over our many years working together — even in disagreement — Colin was always someone who gave you his best and treated you with respect,\" the president said in a statement.\n\n\"Colin embodied the highest ideals of both warrior and diplomat. He was committed to our nation's strength and security above all,\" Mr. Biden added. \"Time and again, he put country before self, before party, before all else — in uniform and out — and it earned him the universal respect of the American people.\"\n\nDuring an event for teachers at the White House Monday, Mr. Biden said people should \"absolutely\" still get vaccinated.\n\n\"Well, by the way, he had serious underlying conditions, as you know,\" he said. \"That's the problem. It wasn't that the vaccinations aren't good. He had two very serious underlying conditions and unfortunately, it didn't work. God love him.\"\n\nBorn April 5, 1937, in Harlem, New York, to Jamaican immigrants, Powell was a ground-breaking figure in Washington and garnered respect from both sides of the aisle.\n\nPowell joined the U.S. Army after graduating from college in 1958. Across his 35-year military career, he served two tours in Vietnam and was stationed in West Germany and South Korea.\n\nHe would go on to serve in top roles under four presidents, first as national security adviser to President Ronald Reagan, and then as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under President George H.W. Bush and President Bill Clinton, as the first African-American to hold the role. Powell then was tapped by President George W. Bush as secretary of state.\n\nPowell led the State Department during the September 11, 2001, terror attacks and favored taking military action against al Qaeda. He also supported the invasion of Iraq and appeared before the United Nations to present evidence that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. The chief justification for the war in Iraq, however, rested on bad intelligence.\n\nPowell would go on to call his 2003 speech before the United Nations describing the weapons program in Iraq a \"blot\" on his record.\n\nWhile Powell served primarily Republican presidents and was floated as a possible candidate himself, he drifted away from the GOP in his later years. The retired four-star general endorsed former President Barack Obama in 2008 over Republican nominee Senator John McCain, and again in 2012.

His heart disease did not cause the subdual or the neck restraint.\"\n\nFloyd had hypertensive heart disease, Baker said, \"meaning his heart weighed more than it should.\" This meant Floyd's heart needed more oxygen than a normal heart and was \"limited in its ability\" to provide more oxygen when there was a demand for it.\n\nIn the midst of an altercation and being held to the ground, adrenaline would pour into the body, Baker said, making the heart beat faster.\n\n\"In my opinion, the law enforcement subdual, restraint and the neck compression was just more than Mr. Floyd could take by virtue of those heart conditions,\" he said.\n\nChauvin's defense attorney, Eric Nelson, has argued that Floyd died as a result of drugs and preexisting health conditions. And under cross examination, Baker said he believed those factors played a role.\n\n\"So in your opinion,\" Nelson asked, \"both the heart disease as well as the history of hypertension and the drugs that were in his system played a role in Mr. Floyd's death?\"\n\n\"In my opinion, yes,\" Baker said.\n\nBut Baker reiterated he stood by the cause of death he wrote on Floyd's death certificate and his finding Floyd's death was a homicide, which to a medical examiner means his death was caused by another person and does not necessarily indicate guilt."}

Justice cannot tolerate armed persons crossing state lines looking for trouble while people engage in First Amendment-protected protest,\" Nadler wrote in a tweet posted Friday afternoon.\n\nCan Kyle Rittenhouse face federal charges?\n\nIn order for Rittenhouse to face federal charges, there are several complicated factors that could make it unlikely for federal prosecutors to pursue a case.\n\nFor most homicide cases, federal law typically only applies in crimes that specifically violate federal law. According to Shouse Law Group, a criminal justice team in Los Angeles, the crime of murder \"is prosecuted in state courts as a state crime. But murder becomes a federal crime when it occurs in violation of federal law, or when it takes place on a federal land or territory.\"\n\nShouse Law Group writes, \"The federal crime of murder is defined as the 'unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought.' In general, there are seven scenarios when an unlawful killing violates the laws of the federal government.\"\n\nAccording to the law group, these include when:\n\nthe murder is of a federal judge or a federal law enforcement official\n\nthe killing is of an immediate family member of a federal law enforcement official\n\nthe murder is of an elected or appointed federal official\n\nthe killing is committed during a bank robbery\n\nthe killing takes place aboard a ship at sea that is engaged in interstate commerce per the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution\n\nthe murder was designed to influence a court case\n\nthe killing takes place on federal property\n\nRittenhouse was not accused of a hate crime and because he is not a member of law enforcement, he cannot be charged with depriving anyone of their civil rights as a federal agent. Rittenhouse was also not accused of a robbery on federal property or involving a federal business.\n\nThe charges Rittenhouse was facing became a flashpoint in the debate over guns, vigilantism and racial justice in the country."}

There were some good ones.\n\nFor those who root for Tom Brady, congratulations. For those of us who don't root for Tom Brady, well, I mean, we're kind of running out of things to say and/or do. The man just keeps on winning and it's starting to feel like it's just going to keep happening for eternity. Brady, who now plays for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, locked up his 7th Super Bowl (the most of any player ever) in his first season since leaving the New England Patriots.\n\nLast year's champion Kansas City Chiefs and their incredible young QB Patrick Mahomes seemed to be a good match for Brady and the Bucs, but that turned out to not be the case; Brady was formidable on offense, particularly when hooking up with his old pal Rob Gronkowski, but it was the way Tampa's defense, led by Defensive Coordinator Todd Bowles, stifled the Kansas City offense that powered the Bucs to their win in the big game.\n\nSuper Bowl LV was exciting for some, and frustrating for many, but at least there's one thing from the game's aftermath that can bring people together: funny memes and tweets. Some may just have to acknowledge Brady's undeniable greatness, while others can make fun of a bit of the man's corniness. It's all fair game in love and memes.\n\nLet's take a look at some of our favorites.\n\nSure, Tom Brady won another Super Bowl. But at least that makes for an excuse to make a little fun of his old New England Patriots coach, Bill Belichick.\n\nRobert Horry, an NBA champion with the Lakers and Spurs and one of the most underrated winners in sports, shouted Brady out for matching his own seven rings.\n\nSomeone else with 7 rings? Ariana Grande, who has a banger of a 2019 single called, yes, \"7 rings.\"\n\nDoesn't it feel like we've been hearing about Brady throwing to Gronkowski in the Super Bowl for decades at this point?\n\nIt just feels all too familiar...\n\nHe's also old.\n\nHe may not even be the most important QB on his own team! (Yes, this is a joke.)\n\nAnd, let's be real, it did feel like some of the penalty calls got a bit one-sided at certain points.\n\nSometimes, sorry, Brady is just an easy target.\n\nWe can also get a little existential with all of this if it will make anyone feel any better.\n\nIt also brought up a bit of conversation about some other G.O.A.T.S.\n\nLeBron James (age 36) recognized a fellow athlete with, let's say, seniority.\n\nLindsey Berra (granddaughter of baseball legend Yogi Berra) made a good point: no one's really touching Yogi just yet.\n\nBut as much as we make fun, it's really kind of impossible to deny the man's achievements at this point.\n\nUntil next year, NFL fans, we're just going to have to deal with Brady as the reigning champ again. Just more motivation for an extra fiery offseason, if you ask this guy."}

They played a montage of out-of-context clips showing Democrats, some of them senators now serving as jurors, also telling supporters to \"fight,\" aiming to establish a parallel with Trump's overheated rhetoric.\n\n\"This is ordinary political rhetoric that is virtually indistinguishable from the language that has been used by people across the political spectrum for hundreds of years,\" declared Trump lawyer Michael van der Veen. \"Countless politicians have spoken of fighting for our principles.\"\n\nBut the presentation blurred the difference between general encouragement to battle for causes and Trump's fight against officially accepted national election results. The defeated president was telling his supporters to fight on after every state had verified its results, after the Electoral College had affirmed them and after nearly every election lawsuit filed by Trump and his allies had been rejected in court.\n\nThe case is speeding toward a vote and likely acquittal, perhaps as soon as Saturday, with the Senate evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans and a two-thirds majority required for conviction.

(CBS 58) -- A group of Democrats want to update the state's gun laws for minors which supporters say could fix a \"loophole\" that could have prevented Kyle Rittenhouse from carrying a semiautomatic rifle during last year's unrest in Kenosha.\n\nThe bill introduced by Democrats from Kenosha would only allow minors to possess a long gun or long barrel rifle if they are legally hunting. Under current law, there's an exception which allows a minor to possess a long gun or rifle if the barrel is longer than 16 inches.\n\nThe proposal comes weeks after a jury found Kyle Rittenhouse not guilty on all five charges he faced. During the trail, the defense argued the AR-15 firearm Rittenhouse had the night of the shooting did not fit the definition of a short-barreled shotgun under state statute.\n\nThis resulted in Judge Bruce Schroeder dropping Rittenhouse's underage gun possession charge.\n\nState Sen. Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee) said the proposal to clarify state law is necessary to prevent minors from \"roaming the streets\" with long guns.\n\n\"This clarifies if you are hunting that's fine, that's the intent of the law,\" Larson said. \"But to say that someone is out when there is a curfew in place, basically going around taunting people with a gun and saying that's acceptable is pretty ridiculous.\"\n\nRepublican lawmakers have long resisted reforming Wisconsin's gun laws because they fear the measures would take guns away from law abiding citizens, arguing it infringes on their second amendment rights.\n\nState Sen. Patrick Testin (R-Stevens Point) is concerned the bill could impact students who participate in school rifle clubs.\n\n\"You could potentially rule out a number of schools that have school sports teams where if they are going out to shoot at clay pigeons and they probably wouldn't be able to carry their shotguns or long guns,\" said Testin.\n\nOne of the bill sponsors, Rep. Tod Ohnstad (D-Kenosha), said the proposal would simply clarify the intent of the law passed decades ago that allows minors to hunt.\n\n\"This bill does the same; however, it just doesn't allow them to carry AR-15's or other long rifles on our streets,\" Ohnstad said in a statement. \"This is a dangerous loophole and it must be clarified.\"\n\nGun Safety Bills\n\nThis week, Democrats also introduced a package of bills called the \"Safe Storage of Gun Safety.\"\n\nSome proposals include requiring businesses that sell guns to secure all firearms when the business is unattended, giving customers a secure lockable container or trigger lock for the gun during purchase, and creating a reporting system for lost or stolen guns which would have to be reported within 24 hours.\n\n\"Gun violence and accidental shootings continue to pose serious public health and public safety risks,\" said Rep. Lisa Subeck (D-Madison). \"To make our communities safer, the 'Safe Storage for Gun Safety' plan would prevent gun violence and accidental deaths by keeping firearms out of those who simply should not have them.\"\n\nRepublican leaders are unlikely to support the measures due to their resistance on similar proposals introduced in years past.\n\nThe range of bills come as President Joe Biden and Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers have attempted to tighten gun control laws such as implementing universal background checks and so-called 'red flag' laws that allow a judge to take away guns from those who might be a dangerous to themselves or others.\n\n\"Any attempt to water down the second amendment is going to have issues in my perspective,\" Testin said."}

The independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) overseeing the trial identified no safety concerns related to the vaccine. The United Kingdom-based global biopharmaceutical company AstraZeneca developed the vaccine and led the trial as regulatory sponsor.\n\nThe National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, provided funding support for the trial through the federal COVID-19 response.\n\nThe placebo-controlled trial began in August 2020. The analysis is based on results from 32,449 adult volunteer participants enrolled across 88 sites in the United States, Chile and Peru. One participant received a placebo for every two participants who received AZD1222, resulting in approximately 20,000 people receiving the investigational vaccine. The vaccine was administered as two doses of 5 x1010 viral particles four weeks apart.\n\nAZD1222 demonstrated statistically significant vaccine efficacy of 78.9% in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 and 100% efficacy in preventing severe or critical disease and hospitalization. In participants 65 years and older, who comprised 20% of the trial population, vaccine efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 was 79.9%.\n\nThe DSMB conducted a review of thrombotic events (blood clots) and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) among participants and found no increased risk of these conditions in vaccinated participants.\n\nApproximately 79% of participants were white, 22% were Hispanic, 8% were Black or African American, 4% were Native American, including American Indian/Alaska Native participants residing in the U.S., and 4% were Asian. Vaccine efficacy was consistent across ethnicity. Approximately 60% of participants of any age had underlying health conditions associated with an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19, such as diabetes, severe obesity or cardiac disease.\n\nAuthorization and guidelines for use of the vaccine in the United States will be determined by the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention after thorough review of the data by independent advisory committees. Today's results build on data from multiple clinical trials of AZD1222 conducted worldwide. The World Health Organization has recommended use of the vaccine for prevention of COVID-19 in adults and it is currently available for use in more than 70 countries.

Specific tests authorized this week:\n\nQuidel QuickVue At-Home OTC COVID-19 test - authorized for OTC at-home serial screening\n\nAbbott BinaxNOW (multiple configurations) Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Antigen Self Test – authorized for OTC at-home serial screening Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card 2 Home Test - authorized for OTC at-home serial screening with telehealth proctor Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag 2 Card – authorized for POC serial screening without a prescription\n\nBD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of SARS-CoV-2 – authorized for POC serial screening with a prescription\n\nThese tests had been previously authorized by the agency (some under different names) to test those with COVID-19 symptoms, but the actions this week authorize testing of asymptomatic individuals when used for serial testing.\n\nThese authorizations follow the agency's multiple steps to streamline the process for test developers interested in authorization for screening with serial testing to increase consumer access to testing, as well as information the FDA has issued to help schools, workplaces, communities, and others establish screening programs."}

As such, his right leg bore the brunt of the force to his body in the accident.\n\nWoods' overall injury pattern resembles what is common in high-speed motor vehicle injuries.\n\nAccording to Dr. Provencher, though not fully confirmed, Woods' injuries include:\n\nOpen tibia and fibula fractures, compound and comminuted in nature. Compound means the bones were through the skin, and comminuted means they were not \"clean\" breaks, and the bones had numerous fragments.\n\nInjuries to his ankle and foot area. Though this is still unclear, Woods might have had an ankle fracture, an injury to the bone that supports the ankle (the talus) or an injury to the midfoot, called a Lisfranc injury. Any of these could affect ankle mobility and function.\n\nDamage to the soft tissues surrounding the tibia. The fractures Woods sustained cause injuries to the skin and muscles of the calf. Also, blood from the injured bones and muscles can cause the calf compartment to swell.\n\nWoods fractured both the tibia and fibula in his right leg, and it has been reported that the tibia was open (bone through the skin) and comminuted (broken in multiple pieces). This is the typical location for a break in the tibia and fibula in this kind of fracture. A surgical rod was used to stabilize Woods' leg.\n\nWoods had a titanium nail placed in his tibia, a common treatment for this kind of fracture. Nails are typically permanent and biocompatible (hence, made of titanium), and they stabilize the bone. The nail restores the tibia to its natural length and controls rotation, ensuring the tibia is aligned with the ankle and foot bones.\n\nWoods had his calf compartment released during surgery. That was likely due to swelling in the calf, which can suffocate the muscle from blood flow and cause necrosis (death) of the muscle tissue — which is dangerous and irreversible — or as a preventive measure to avoid compartment syndrome, which is important for successful recovery.\n\nWhat are some other concerns?"}

Forensic experts weigh in.\n\nThe available evidence from the recent car crash involving Tiger Woods indicates that the famed golfer was not paying attention to the road and drifted off of it before crashing his car, three forensic car accident experts told USA TODAY Sports.\n\nThe same experts also say the evidence does not indicate he lost control of his vehicle because of excessive speed on a curved downhill road that is known for speeding cars.\n\nThey arrived at this theory based on several factors, especially the way Woods' vehicle appeared to keep going straight ahead instead of staying on the road as it curved right.\n\nWoods, 45, was traveling north near Los Angeles when his sports utility vehicle left its lane, went across the median into the southbound lanes, went off the road, hit a tree, rolled over and sustained major frontal damage. Woods also broke multiple bones in his lower right leg, which indicates he was applying the brake at the time of impact, according to the experts. They also said the evidence indicates Woods applied the brake late into the collision sequence.\n\n\"To me, this is like a classic case of falling asleep behind the wheel, because the road curves and his vehicle goes straight,\" said Jonathan Cherney, a consultant who provides car accident analysis as an expert witness in court cases. Cherney, a former police detective, examined the Woods' crash site in person since the accident on Tuesday.\n\n\"It's a drift off the road, almost like he was either unconscious, suffering from a medical episode or fell asleep and didn't wake up until he was off the road and that's where the brake application came in,\" Cherney said.\n\nThere were no skid marks on the road to indicate braking, according to Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva. Woods' vehicle did have anti-lock brakes. So even if he was to slam on the brakes prior to hitting the curb, \"you wouldn't necessarily see tire marks,\" said Felix Lee, an accident reconstruction expert who is part of the Expert Institute, a network that provides expert witnesses in litigation.\n\nLee said a key clue is how the vehicle did not change direction entering the curve and instead went directly into the median.\n\n\"My feeling is that speed wasn't that much of an issue,\" Lee said. \"It was just some kind of inattention that caused the curb strike.\"\n\nAfter leaving his lane and striking the median, Woods' vehicle went about 400 feet before stopping. Cherney said he didn't see evidence of \"any steering input\" that would indicate Woods tried to avoid the emergency.\n\nThis suggests a \"very delayed response\" by Woods to the situation, said Rami Hashish, principal at the National Biomechanics Institute, which analyzes the cause of accidents. \"It was suggesting he wasn't paying attention at all.\"\n\nHashish said he suspects the damage to the vehicle and Woods would have been much greater if he had been traveling at an excessive speed. The speed limit on that road is 45 mph.\n\n\"You can walk away with a broken leg from 45 to 50 mph,\" Hashish said. \"If you're hitting 60, 65 and you're hitting a stationary object, your likelihood of death increases exponentially.\"\n\nIf he was going 80 mph, \"he wouldn't be having an open fracture in this leg,\" Hashish said. \"He'd be dead.\""}

The American Rescue Plan also sent money directly to families in the form of the expanded federal . The first half of the newly expanded credit is being delivered directly to families.\n\nThere's a specific set of people that the IRS was trying to reach and it could mean a lot of money for those families.\n\nThe expanded Child Tax Credit payments can help out a family. The government sends families $300 for each child under the age of 6. Families get $250 per child ages 6 to 17. The payments are happening between July and December of 2021. That means a family with one child under 6 years old will have received $1,800 by the time the advanced payments end in December.\n\nThere are some families that were not already receiving the payments who also do not normally file a tax return because of the amount of money they make. People could have received these benefits, even if they don't work and even if they receive no income. There was a timeline for those families to sign up for the one-time payment. They needed to notify the IRS of their status by November 15.\n\nAccording to the IRS, those families will get the entire first half of the Child Tax Credit as a single payment. Families who signed up by Monday will receive half of their total Child Tax Credit on December 15. This means a payment of up to $1,800 for each child, under 6, and up to $1,500 for each child, ages 6 to 17.\n\nThe future of the expanded Child Tax Credit is up in the air. The Biden administration would like to and to make the expanded credit permanent.\n\nSome lawmakers in Washington D.C want to make changes to the tax credit - namely Democratic West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin, who, in particular, would like to to the payments."}

We're not going to win scoring no points.\"\n\nDespite playing without coach Sean Payton on the sideline, the Saints (7-7) beat the Bucs (10-4) for the seventh straight time during the regular season — fourth since Brady left New England for Tampa Bay in 2020.\n\nAnd no doubt, defense was the driving force behind this one.\n\n\"You can't say enough about what they did to pitch a shutout like that. And against a Brady-led offense, it's incredible,\" Saints quarterback Taysom Hill said. \"Part of our play calling and all that was reflective of how well they were playing.\"\n\nThe victory gave New Orleans a sweep of the season series between the NFC South rivals and boosted the Saints into playoff position with a hold on the conference's final wild card. It also forced Tampa Bay to wait at least another week to clinch its first division crown since 2007.\n\nThe Bucs, who did win a playoff game at New Orleans last January en route to winning the Super Bowl, lead the division by three games with three weeks remaining in the regular season.\n\nWith defensive coordinator Dennis Allen standing in for Payton, who missed the game after testing positive for COVID-19, the Saints stymied the NFL's No. 1 passing and scoring offense and ended Brady's streak of 255 consecutive starts (including playoff games) without being shut out.\n\nFormer Saints star Drew Brees (304) is the only quarterback with a longer run.\n\n\"This wasn't in any way a one-man show,\" Allen said. \"This was an organization that came together and won a game.\"\n\nJordan had two of New Orleans' four sacks, surpassing 100 for his career, and forced a key fumble in the lowest-scoring game of the NFL season. It was the first time Brady lost to an opponent that didn't manage a touchdown."}

Most jurors stopped taking notes, as they leaned toward the screens to watch recordings that have been played millions of times around the world.\n\nA solemn Rittenhouse also appeared to be paying close attention to the videos, taking notes and whispering to his lawyers while the sound of his gunshots rang out in the courtroom. He purposefully looked away, however, whenever images appeared on the screen of the men he shot injured and, in one case, dying.\n\nRittenhouse, a then-17-year-old from north suburban Antioch, crossed state lines and volunteered to patrol downtown Kenosha amid turmoil surrounding the shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, by a white police officer. Carrying an AR-15-style rifle that police say a friend illegally purchased for him, Rittenhouse fatally shot two people and injured a third.\n\nRittenhouse has pleaded not guilty, arguing he killed Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber and wounded Gaige Grosskreutz in self-defense.\n\nWith Kenosha police Detective Martin Howard on the witness stand, prosecutors walked jurors through roughly a half-dozen videos taken that night. They started with interviews Rittenhouse gave to journalists before the shootings, in which he boasted about being a medic and unknowingly foreshadowed his criminal defense.\n\n\"People are getting injured and our job is to protect this business,\" Rittenhouse said as he stood in front of a used car lot in one clip. \"And part of my job also is to protect people. If someone is hurt, I'm running into harm's way. That's why I have my rifle; I've gotta protect myself obviously.\"\n\nWearing blue plastic gloves and a homemade first-aid kit around his waist, the video shows Rittenhouse walking through Kenosha streets calling out for anyone who needs a medic. He provided aid to a few people that night, according to earlier testimony, but Rittenhouse — a lifeguard who had not yet finished high school — is not a trained emergency medical technician.\n\nEarlier in the day, a social media influencer who recorded Rittenhouse before the shootings testified about his observations that night. Koerri Washington said he remembered thinking an armed Rittenhouse looked \"young\" and \"nervous\" as he chain-smoked in a gas station parking lot. He didn't single him out as problematic, however.\n\n\"It wasn't like I thought he was going to go and mow a bunch of people down,\" Washington said.\n\nJurors saw a video, taken later in the evening, in which four shots rang out after Rosenbaum chased Rittenhouse through the car lot. Shortly before the chase, Rittenhouse could be heard yelling, \"friendly! friendly\" to indicate he was not looking for a conflict.\n\nThe defense has emphasized that Rosenbaum had been menacing people with a chain that night, but Howard testified that Rosenbaum threw a plastic bag at Rittenhouse before the shooting and was not carrying a weapon.\n\n\"I can only see a plastic bag,\" he said.\n\nProsecutors played a video of bystanders trying to help Rosenbaum after he was shot. They scream about trying to put pressure on the wounds, while a dying Rosenbaum takes loud, rattling breaths.\n\n\"Stay with me!\" one man yells.\n\nAs the bloody images played on screens around the courtroom, Rittenhouse turned his head so he could not see any of them. He only looked at the monitors again when he heard the recording stop.\n\nAfter shooting Rosenbaum, Rittenhouse ran up one of Kenosha's main streets until he tripped and fell. Once on the ground, a man tried to kick him but missed. Rittenhouse fired at him in return and missed him.\n\nHuber then hit Rittenhouse with his skateboard, and the teen fired a fatal shot into his chest. An armed Grosskreutz took a step toward Rittenhouse and was shot in the arm.\n\nThe jurors later watched video of Grosskreutz, a trained medic, instruct a bystander on how to tie a tourniquet around his arm to stop the massive bleeding."}

We are concerned about our leadership as they could target them if not controlled them successfully,\" said one of the Taliban intelligence officials.\n\nIslamic State in Khorasan, the name taken from the ancient name for the region that includes modern Afghanistan, first emerged in late 2014 but has declined from its peak around 2018 following a series of heavy losses inflicted by both the Taliban and U.S. forces.\n\nTaliban security forces in Nangarhar said they had killed three members of the movement on Wednesday night and the intelligence officials said the movement still retains the ability to cause trouble through small-scale attacks.\n\n\"Their main structure is broken and they are now divided in small groups to carry out attacks,\" one of them said.\n\nFUNDING DRIED UP\n\nThe Taliban have said repeatedly that they will not allow Afghanistan to be used as a base for attacks on other countries. But some Western analysts believe the return of the Islamist group to power has invigorated groups like ISIS-K and al Qaeda, which had made Afghanistan their base when the Taliban last ruled the country.\n\n\"In Afghanistan, the return of Taliban is a huge victory for the Islamists,\" said Rohan Gunaratna, professor of security studies at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University. \"They have celebrated the return of the Taliban, so I think that Afghanistan is the new theatre.\"\n\nISIS-K is believed to draw many of its fighters from the ranks of the Taliban or the Pakistani version of the Taliban, known as the TTP, but much of the way it operates remains little understood.\n\nIt has fought the Taliban over smuggling routes and other economic interests but it also supports a global Caliphate under Islamic law, in contrast with the Taliban which insists it has no interest in anywhere outside Afghanistan.\n\nMost analysts, as well as the United Nations peg ISIS-K's strength at under 2,000 fighters, compared to as many as 100,000 at the Taliban's disposal. The ranks of ISIS-K were swollen with prisoners released when Afghanistan's jails were opened by the Taliban as they swept through the country.\n\nAccording to a June report by the UN security council, ISIS-K's financial and logistic ties to its parent organisation in Syria have weakened, though it does retain some channels of communication.\n\n\"Funding support to the Khorasan branch from the core is believed to have effectively dried up,\" the report said."}

{"id": "articles-cleaned-truncated/news-2021-01-01-2021-12-31-hurricaneida/art-010", "text": "How climate change made Hurricane Ida worse\n\nCNN — Human-caused climate change is making hurricanes more dangerous. They are producing more rainfall, moving slower once they make landfall and generating larger storm surges along the coast. Hurricane Ida was a prime example of those changes, and scientists say storms like this will become more common as the planet warms.\n\nFueled by warmer-than-normal water in the Gulf of Mexico, Hurricane Ida destroyed homes, uprooted trees and cut off power to more than 1 million residents. It battered Mississippi and the already storm-ravaged state of Louisiana, and officials there say they expect the death toll to increase in the coming days.\n\nHurricane Ida was just the latest in back-to-back storms that have slammed Louisiana in recent years. But Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at the Nature Conservancy and professor at Texas Tech University, said an important distinction is not the frequency of the storms but their severity.\n\n\"We've always had hurricanes, we've always had heat waves, we've always had floods and droughts, but what climate change is doing is loading the weather dice against us,\" Hayhoe told CNN. \"It's sneaking in when we're not looking, changing the numbers as we're rolling and asking what is this, how could this happen?\"\n\n\"The answer to that is climate change,\" she said.\n\nHurricanes are getting stronger\n\nHurricanes — also called tropical cyclones or typhoons outside North America — are being made more intense by the warming ocean, which studies have shown has absorbed approximately 90% of the planet's excess heat trapped by human-produced greenhouse gas emissions. And a recent study found that the planet is trapping roughly double the amount of heat than it did nearly 15 years ago.\n\nAs the planet heats up, storms get stronger.\n\nThe recent state-of-the-science United Nations report on climate change concluded that the global proportion of cyclones ranging from Category 3 to 5 — the most intense storms — has increased over the last four decades due to rapidly warming ocean temperatures. For every additional degree of warmth, scientists say not only will the proportion of intense cyclones continue to climb, but extreme rain events are also forecast to intensify by about 7%.\n\n\"We know that, in general, hurricanes are intensifying faster,\" Hayhoe said. \"They are bigger and stronger than they would be otherwise; they have a lot more rainfall associated with them, and rising sea level exacerbates storm surge.\"\n\nBefore making landfall on Sunday, Hurricane Ida went through a remarkable period of strengthening: its maximum sustained winds increased by 65 mph in just 24 hours.\n\nScientists define rapid intensification — a process that historically has been rare — as an increase of 35 mph in 24 hours or less. Hurricane Ida nearly doubled that definition.\n\nFor rapid intensification to occur, warm ocean water must extend well below the surface, going hundreds of feet deep, to provide enough engine for the hurricane to strengthen. This has led scientists to believe that storms are more likely to undergo rapid intensification as a result of warmer oceans.\n\n\"If you increase the speed limit, you make more room for the storms to strengthen, so it can intensify more quickly,\" Jim Kossin, a senior scientist with the Climate Service, an organization that provides climate risk analysis to governments and businesses, told CNN.\n\nIda made landfall in Louisiana as a Category 4, and is now tied in the record books with Laura in 2020 as the strongest hurricane to make landfall there.\n\nHurricanes are wetter and moving slower\n\nHighway 51 was flooded on Monday by Hurricane Ida near LaPlace, Louisiana. Mickey Welsh/Montgomery Advert/USA TODAY Network\n\nStorms are also generating more rainfall. For every degree of warming, the atmosphere can hold 7% more water vapor that could fall as rain. After flooding from Hurricane Harvey devastated the Houston area in 2017, scientists found that human-caused climate change supercharged the storm's rainfall by approximately 15%.\n\nHurricane Ida has dumped more than 15 inches of rain on parts of Louisiana, according to the National Weather Service. As the remnants of the storm arc from the South to New England, another 3 to 7 inches of rain is expected across at least 12 states, including areas already impacted by severe flooding this month such as Tennessee and New Jersey.\n\nPaul Miller, a coastal meteorology scientists at Louisiana State University, said southeast Louisiana, including Baton Rouge and New Orleans, experienced one of its wettest seasons on record. According to Miller, it rained on 91% of the days between June 18 and July 19 at the New Orleans airport, compared to the region's average of 40-50%.\n\n\"It's been a historically wet year in southeast Louisiana even before Ida,\" he told CNN. \"This really exacerbated concerns about flooding during Ida because the ground had already absorbed a lot of water this year.\"\n\nSatellite data also shows that storms are getting slower, particularly after they make landfall, according to Hayhoe. Slower and larger storms means they can cover a greater area, idle and dump more rain during that time period.\n\nAnd, while experts say the research is still developing, a 2020 study published in the journal Nature found storms are staying stronger farther inland than they did five decades ago. Since hurricanes are fueled by warm ocean water, they tend to weaken over land, but in recent years they have been raging longer after landfall. The study concludes that warmer sea surface temperatures are leading to a \"slower decay\" by increasing the amount of moisture that a hurricane can carry.\n\nStorm surge is getting higher\n\nStorm surge, the flooding that occurs when hurricane winds push ocean water over land, is also getting worse due to sea level rise. Hayhoe said storm surge can inundate a larger area now than it would from a hurricane of the same intensity about 50 or 100 years ago."}

At this time, our students' and staff's well-being is our top priority. As a community, we will remain united in this time of tragedy,\" Noll wrote.\n\nThe president of the Iowa State Education Association, Mike Beranek, also expressed heartbreak over Graber's killing Thursday afternoon.\n\n\"Our thoughts and prayers go out to her family, friends and her colleagues ...

Scary enough that the odds of keeping his leg once stood \"damn-near 50/50,\" according to Tiger himself.\n\n\"There was a point in time when, I wouldn't say it was 50/50, but it was damn-near there if I was going to walk out of that hospital with one leg,\" Woods told Golf Digest in an interview released Monday.\n\nThe revelation comes on the heels of Woods' first public comments in nearly nine months: a 40-minute interview in which Woods discussed his injuries, his path back to professional golf, and his advice for his son Charlie.\n\nOn the topic of the accident in Rolling Hills Estates, Calif., Woods had plenty to say — though the news might come as a stark dose of reality for many hoping for a similar comeback to the one Woods completed in 2018. The 15-time major champion seemed resigned to the fact that his body no longer has what it takes to compete regularly at a high level.\n\n\"I don't have to compete and play against the best players in the world to have a great life,\" he said. \"After my back fusion, I had to climb Mount Everest one more time. I had to do it, and I did. This time around, I don't think I'll have the body to climb Mount Everest, and that's okay.\"\n\nInstead, Woods seemed to indicate his desire to follow in the footsteps of Ben Hogan, playing only a select number of tournaments at his own discretion. But that future is still a long way from the present.\n\n\"I think something that is realistic is playing the Tour one day — never full time, ever again — but pick and choose, just like [Ben] Hogan did,\" he said. \"Pick and choose a few events a year and you play around that, you practice around that, and you gear yourself up for that. I think that's how I'm going to have to play it from now on. It's an unfortunate reality, but it's my reality. I understand it, and I accept it.\"\n\nWoods spoke extensively about the rehab process, including a prolonged stay in isolation in southern California, during which time he received near round-the-clock treatment.\n\n\"In a hotel room and I'm hooked up with wires everywhere and people poking and prodding me at 2-3 in the morning for more bloodwork,\" he said. \"It was just like, c'mon. You know? How much is enough?\"\n\nOnce Woods recovered to the point that he was no longer at risk of amputation, his attention shifted to his hands — testing to see he'd kept his dexterity in the wake of the crash.\n\n\"I wanted to test and see that I still had my hands. So even in the hospital, I had Erica [Herman] and Rob [McNamara] throw me something,\" he said. \"Throw it over here, catch it over there. Then the nurse comes in. 'What? I wasn't doing anything?' Nurse leaves, 'Okay, let's go!' We were being kids, we were isolated, we were doing shenanigans. Just anything to pass the time.\"\n\nIn March, he returned home to Florida after nearly a month in the hospital. He was kept inside for months, leaning on lessons from his father Earl to endure grueling rehab sessions.\n\n\"This is where my dad's teachings came into play,\" he said. \"Being in the military, you don't know how long a firefight's going to take. It could last five seconds, it could last five hours. Some could go on for days at a time. You don't know when the end is. That's the hard part.\""}

But Beware the Downside\n\nAfter a shocking day in American history when a violent mob, incited by President Trump, stormed and breached the Capitol Building, Facebook and Twitter temporarily banned the president from using their platforms. On Thursday morning, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg went a step further, announcing Trump will be banned from Facebook's social media platforms until at least the end of his term on January 20.\n\nThe events were a direct reaction to words that Trump has repeated on social media, and that he said at a rally Wednesday before the attack on the Capitol—baseless claims about election fraud, the election being stolen from him, and his loss to Joe Biden in November.\n\n\"I think that banning [Trump's] account is the right call for social networks, but it might have unforeseen consequences,\" says Gianluca Stringhini, a Boston University College of Engineering assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering. He has been studying online disinformation, hate speech, and radicalization for years, and recently earned a National Science Foundation CAREER award to develop tools to rapidly identify coordinated cyber mobs.\n\nIn a recent paper, Stringhini and his collaborators studied what can unfold after radical online communities are banned from platforms. The researchers analyzed online posts made between 2017 and 2020 from r/The_Donald and r/Incels, two communities that were banned from Reddit and subsequently moved to stand-alone websites. They found overall that having them banned significantly decreased posting activity, reducing the number of posts, active users, and newcomers.\n\nBut r/The_Donald users that migrated to an independent website called thedonald.win showed signs of increased toxicity and radicalization. According to Stringhini, their findings paint a nuanced picture of the effect of platform moderation action and should help inform decisions that platforms, and government officials, make when it comes to dealing with false and hateful messages.\n\nThe Brink caught up with Stringhini to discuss Wednesday's events, and what impact a ban on Twitter and Facebook could have on Trump and his followers.\n\nQ & A With Gianluca Stringhini The Brink: Can you explain how Wednesday's events at the Capitol were fueled by online communities? Do you see a clear connection? Stringhini: In the past five years, my collaborators and I observed a tendency for people to move to polarized online communities where they could discuss their political—and often extreme—views without fearing censorship. We found that relatively small communities like 4chan's Politically Incorrect Board, Reddit's r/The_Donald subreddit, and websites Gab, Voat, and Parler became fertile grounds for conspiracy theories, disinformation, and online hate. This nefarious content then makes its way to mainstream social networks, where millions of users see it. Oftentimes, this migration of content from fringe communities to mainstream ones is facilitated by popular figures. For example, President Trump's Twitter account has posted conspiratorial and hateful content that first appeared in one of these small communities multiple times."}

Richards wrote that Rosenbaum started the altercation with Rittenhouse in hopes of making off with his assault-style rifle, which only bolsters Rittenhouse's self-defense argument.\n\nKimberley Motley, an attorney representing Rosenbaum's estate, rejected Richards' theory but declined to comment further since the case against Rittenhouse remains open.\n\n\"We believe strongly that Mr. Rittenhouse was the aggressor and his actions were not lawful,\" she said in a phone interview Tuesday.\n\nRichards also filed a motion to dismiss a charge that Rittenhouse couldn't possess a gun because he was too young under Wisconsin law, arguing that statutes prohibit minors from possessing short-barreled shotguns and rifles, and Rittenhouse's assault-style rifle doesn't meet that definition.\n\nFact Check: What's true, what's not in the Kenosha shootings involving Jacob Blake, Kyle Rittenhouse\n\nRittenhouse, who is white, traveled to Kenosha from his home in Antioch, Illinois, on Aug. 25 to answer a call from local militia to protect businesses from protesters. The demonstrations began after a white Kenosha police officer shot Jacob Blake, who is Black, during a domestic disturbance, leaving Blake paralyzed from the waist down.\n\nThe protests turned chaotic that night. According to prosecutors, Rittenhouse opened fire on Rosenbaum, Anthony Huber and Gaige Grosskreutz. He killed Rosenbaum and Huber. Grosskreutz was hit but survived.\n\nRittenhouse was 17 years old at the time. Now 18, he maintains he fired in self-defense but prosecutors have charged him with a litany of counts, including reckless homicide, recklessly endangering safety, attempted first-degree intentional homicide and being a minor in possession of a dangerous weapon.\n\nBlack Lives Matter supports have painted him as a trigger-happy white supremacist. Conservatives have made him into a symbol for gun rights, generating $2 million for his bail. His trial is scheduled to begin Nov. 1.\n\nProsecutors filed motions last week asking a judge to allow a video from July 2020 which they said shows Rittenhouse striking a teenage girl in the back on Kenosha's waterfront. They also want to argue that Rittenhouse is affiliated with the Proud Boys, a far-right extremist group.\n\nPhotos taken in January show Rittenhouse drinking in a Mount Pleasant bar and gesturing with what appeared to be a white power symbol. Prosecutors said in their motions they have learned the people Rittenhouse was with included the leader of the Proud Boys' Wisconsin chapter and several of its high-ranking members."}

Her death on the \"Rust\" film set is another reminder of what every injured worker knows: that \"accidental\" workplace deaths and injuries are the result of overwork, cost cutting and deliberate neglect of basic safety by management. In this case management includes the star and producer of \"Rust,\" Alec Baldwin, who fired the fatal shot that also injured director Joel Souza. The role of assistant director David Halls who handed Baldwin the loaded prop gun is under investigation as well.\n\nHutchins' death occurred during the struggle of film production workers for sufficient hours between shifts and for needed meal breaks, during recent months of 60-hour shifts on film sets. Workers on \"Rust\" were promised housing in Santa Fe, but the movie company broke that promise, and most of them were forced to drive 50 miles each way from Albuquerque to work 12-hour days.\n\nBaldwin had called in a nonunion crew to replace the IATSE members at the time of the shooting. Hutchins, a member of International Cinematographers Guild Local 600, had supported the workers. Local 480 and Local 600 held a candlelight vigil for her Oct. 24, attended by over 400 union members at the Albuquerque Civic Plaza.\n\nOne of the IATSE members at the vigil told Workers World in regards to overall exhaustion and the lack of lunch breaks: \"They give us meal penalties. If we don't break after six hours, they give us more money the longer we don't break. It's good money, but we are exhausted. We don't want the extra money anymore.\"\n\nWhat happened in Santa Fe is not an isolated incident. \"Safety on Set\" is the primary issue for the 60,000 IATSE members across the country who voted in favor of a strike earlier in October. A strike was averted when the union reached a tentative agreement with movie and television industry executives, but the contract could be rejected if members don't think it goes far enough in addressing their issues. That could lead to a strike.\n\nAs the contract vote gets underway, the tragedy in Santa Fe reminds workers of what is at stake. A countrywide IATSE strike would not be an isolated skirmish but would be another front in the current resurgence of labor militancy.\n\nWill Striketober become Strikevember?\n\nAs the month referred to as \"Striketober\" comes to a close, there are more signs of worker resistance. According to Cornell University's Labor Action Tracker, there are at least 40 U.S. strikes in progress currently — 26 of which began this month. New strikes may be on the way.\n\nAfter three years of trying to negotiate a decent contract, 350 Piedmont airlines flight attendants voted Oct. 21 to authorize a strike. After the vote dozens in Philadelphia picketed the company, a subsidiary of American Airlines. The slight wage increase management offered would be more than offset by an increase in the workers' share of health care costs."}

Then this plan is for you.\n\nEven with the Ever Given now slowly moving again, the live animals inside the blistering cargo containers, which are quickly running out of feed and water, are now nearing an even more tragic end than that which awaits them in the slaughterhouses at their destination.\n\nEven if the ships were to resume full course today, the water and food would not last until their sea journey is over.\n\nRomania is the source for the 130,000 of the 200,000 live animals now caught in the Suez bottleneck.\n\nSome six of the 11 ships full to the brim with the live animals from the South-Eastern European nation are in a particularly critical situation. They were supposed to reach harbours in the Persian Gulf over four days ago, but still have not left the Canal.\n\nAccording to EU law, ships carrying live animals need to load 25 percent more food than planned for their trip in case of delays, but animal welfare organisations warned that this rarely happens.\n\nMeanwhile, Păun explained to EUobserver that even with the 25 percent buffer, these ships would now run out of animal feed long before they arrive in port.\n\n\"A ship that left Romania on 16 March was scheduled to arrive in Jordan on 23 March, but instead it would now reach port on 1 April at the earliest. That is a nine-day delay. Even if the ship had the required 25 percent additional animal feed, it would only have lasted for 1.5 days\", he said.\n\nThe 'ANSVSA', the Romanian authority in charge of live-animal exports issued a press release two days ago saying that after reaching out to those in charge on board the ships, there is enough food and water to last a few days.\n\nThe press release added that live animal exports have been currently suspended until the situation in the Suez is dealt with.\n\nBut for Păun, those responsible for the shipment would never admit that animals are dying by the thousands on their vessels.\n\nMeanwhile, the EU legislation does not compel an EU member state to report on animal mortality on board these ships and Romania would never release that information voluntarily because authorities know that it would lead to investigations, he added.\n\nRomania is one of Europe's largest live-sheep exporters and has several times been singled out by the European Commission for its bad practices regarding live-animal exports.\n\nLast year, Romania was red-flagged by Brussels for failing to meet live-animal transport conditions after more than 14,000 sheep drowned when a cargo vessel capsized off the Black Sea coast.\n\nA year earlier, the then EU commissioner for food safety, Vytenis Andriukaitis, urged Romania - to no avail - to stop the export of 70,000 live sheep to the Persian Gulf because temperatures inside the cargo vessel exceed 60 degrees Celsius.\n\nInstead, Romanian authorities increased their live-animal exports, despite an investigation that showed animals exported to Gulf countries dying from the high temperatures, being unloaded violently off ships, squeezed into car trunks, and slaughtered by unskilled butchers.\n\nPăun says the only chance now for some of the animals to make it to destination alive is for Egyptian authorities to move quickly and clear the ships trapped in the Suez.\n\n\"I am appalled that legislation did not offer Romania the power to command cargo ships to return back home. Romania should have used diplomatic pressure to resolve the issue,\" he said.\n\n\"According to a ruling by the European Court of Justice, the EU member state exporting live animals to a third party country is responsible for their wellbeing until reaching destination\", he added."}

Meghan stated in the Oprah interview: 'They didn't want him to be a prince... which would be different from protocol, and [said] that he wasn't going to receive security'.\n\nThe epilogue is said to add that Meghan found doing the interview 'cathartic' and 'liberating', and quotes a friend of hers as alleging that the Royal Family have since taken 'little accountability' for the accusations made against them. The book critiques the way the couple's allegations of racism were handled, comparing it to the action taken after claims of bullying against Meghan, which prompted courtiers to launch an inquiry, with a source stating that 'full ownership was not taken' by the Royal Family to address Meghan's comments.\n\nSocbie and Durand reportedly also make claims about the duke's finances in the run-up to Megxit, stating that Harry and Meghan 'wouldn't have survived' without his inheritance from his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales. The new edition also explores Harry's struggles with leaving elements of his royal role behind him, stating that he was 'deeply saddened' when he wasn't granted permission to have a wreath laid in his name on Remembrance Sunday last year, on account of no longer being a 'frontline royal'.\n\nThe authors cite the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral as a key moment in shifting the tone of interfamilial relations, with a source claiming that while Harry found the ceremony 'surreal', it brought 'progress' towards reconciliation. The book seeks to shed further light on the relationship between Harry and his older brother and father, claiming that he's spoken to the Duke of Cambridge on a number of occasions, while Harry and Prince Charles are on 'light speaking terms'.\n\nIt's also said that while feelings among the Royal Family remain 'raw' in the wake of the Oprah interview, a source close to the couple claims that 'it will force people to talk in order for the healing to begin', although 'it will take time to get past the hurt', adding: 'There has to be some acknowledgement of understanding about what the Sussexes went through in order for there to be progress'."}

While Facebook banned Trump from posting for 24 hours, Twitter locked Trump's account for 12 hours, providing he removes certain Tweets.\n\nFacebook declared an \"emergency situation\" and removed one of Trump's videos, as did YouTube.\n\nOver the last few years, these platforms have had to keep pace with an explosion of misinformation from many sources, including Trump and his supporters, and have reacted in varying ways to try to retain the neutrality of their platforms. While Twitter has added a disclaimer to some Tweets, Trump's supporters from the far right have also seen their content taken down and/or had their accounts banned in the run-up to an acrimonious US presidential election. Twitter has throughout Trump's term chosen not to suspend or revoke his personal account, even though it objectively violates the company's policies on a regular basis.\n\nThese new moves mark some of the most stringent responses from the platforms, which have previously been accused of allowing the president too much leeway.\n\n\"We are appalled by the violence at the Capitol today ... our Elections Operations Center has already been active in anticipation of the Georgia elections and the vote by Congress to certify the election, and we are monitoring activity on our platform in real time,\" Guy Rosen, VP of integrity, and Monika Bickert, VP of global policy management for Facebook said in a blog post. \"As a part of this, we removed from Facebook and Instagram the recent video of President Trump speaking about the protests and his subsequent post about the election results. We made the decision that on balance these posts contribute to, rather than diminish, the risk of ongoing violence.\"\n\n\"We will start removing any piece of content uploaded today (or anytime after) that misleads people by alleging that widespread fraud or errors changed the outcome of the 2020 US Presidential election,\" YouTube also announced.\n\nFacebook's strong statement didn't stop prominent voices, including Alex Stamos, its former security chief, from laying into the platform for being complict in allowing the radical flames to spread in the first place."}

In the months ahead, a Black, South Asian American daughter of immigrants will join their ranks.\n\nWith all the challenges surrounding this unprecedented presidential transition, you'd be forgiven for forgetting that history will also be made on January 20: A century after the first women won the right to vote, America will swear in our first woman vice president.\n\nKamala Harris's inauguration will be a major step towards my lifelong dream and my 20-plus year mission to elect women to the top of the ticket. It couldn't come at a more critical moment.\n\nViolent extremists on the far-right, a once-in-a-century pandemic, and an economic recession awaits the incoming administration. And those are just the most urgent in a long list of looming battles. Whatever role Vice President Harris plays in tackling these crises—including the roll-out of a massive vaccination effort—she is set to redefine American leadership for generations to come.\n\nIt's been said that great leaders are forged in crisis. Our research shows voters agree. Over 20 years at the Barbara Lee Family Foundation, we've found that voters cite \"ability to manage a crisis\" as a critical qualification for executive office.\n\nHistorically, that's meant a higher bar for women. Voters assume men are qualified to manage a crisis, while women have to prove themselves. It's a double standard that can be credited, at least in part, to what we call the \"imagination barrier.\"\n\nTo date, America's most celebrated wartime leaders have been white men like Lincoln, F.D.R. and Kennedy. In the months ahead, a Black, South Asian American daughter of immigrants—a woman whose very presence shatters the imagination barrier—will join their ranks.\n\nAs vice president, Kamala Harris won't just break the leadership mold—she'll bring valuable new dimensions to the role. With a long history of fighting for underserved populations, Harris is sure to be vocal when it comes to representing the interests of the communities most impacted by the many crises we face. That's a quality voters value in leaders, and an area where women are especially known to excel.\n\nIf you found this article helpful, please consider supporting our independent reporting and truth-telling for as little as $5 per month.\n\nHarris's relationship with long-overlooked constituencies has already translated to more inclusive policy. She's introduced legislation ensuring that federal COVID-19 funding is fairly allocated to underserved communities, championed relief for Black and minority-owned small businesses and proposed universal paid sick leave, paid family and medical leave and easier access to child and elder care.\n\nJust as important as smart policy is effective communication. VP-Elect Harris has developed her own style here, too, earning plaudits for her composure, honesty and steadiness, not to mention her singular ability to invoke joy, even during painful moments for the country.\n\nPerhaps even more notable is Harris's ability to listen. As vice president, she will model leadership that listens to scientists and experts, learns from those she represents, and solicits the advice of community leaders and staff who look like America.\n\nFinally, Harris will display confidence that is rooted in competence. As I wrote in August, her arrival at the pinnacle of executive leadership is not a fluke. She has repeatedly broken barriers to become the first woman, first Black person, and first Black woman to serve in each of her elected positions."}

The executive branch is limited in its authority to mandate long-term cyber requirements on the private sector.\n\nThe memorandum specifically addresses industrial control systems (ICS), which monitor, regulate, and automate operational technologies (OT) — a group covering hardware and software that enable functionality of infrastructure physical components, such as circuit breakers, motors, and valves. OT are prevalent throughout critical infrastructure environments, from power grids and telecommunications networks to manufacturing plants, public transportation systems, and energy pipelines.\n\nCompromised ICS/OT can allow attackers, in some cases, to cause physical damage to systems and even widespread outages. Probably the most well-known example is Stuxnet, discovered in 2010. Stuxnet targeted the ICS controlling centrifuges in Iran's Natanz nuclear enrichment facility, ultimately destroying the centrifuges and setting Iran's nuclear program back several years. Stuxnet is widely believed to have been a US-Israeli collaboration, but neither government has ever acknowledged its involvement.\n\nThe ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline in May illustrates a tricky problem: The convergence of traditional information technology and ICS/OT networks. In the Colonial Pipeline incident, the company preemptively shut down the pipeline's ICS/OT network to prevent attackers from traversing IT networks to the ICS network that controls pipeline operations, which could have enabled potential physical damage to the pipeline. The ransomware did not target Colonial's ICS/OT network directly, but the ICS network shutdown resulted in widespread fuel shortages up and down the East Coast that lasted for days."}

Its owner, who had prolific experience in marketing casinos, real estate and even Oreos, used the platform mostly to promote his books, media appearances and give friendly plugs to friends.\n\nBut as Trump began seriously toying with a White House run, it became a tool to scorch opponents and give shape to his nationalist, \"America First\" philosophy.\n\nHe deployed its venom equally, whether insulting celebrity enemies (Rosie O'Donnell was \"crude, rude, obnoxious and dumb\") or using xenophobia to malign a country (Britain is \"trying hard to disguise their massive Muslim problem\").\n\nPeter Costanzo, then an online marketing director for the publishing company putting out Trump's book, \"Think Like a Champion,\" helped bring Trump to the platform.\n\nTwitter was still in its infancy at the time.

Minneapolis public schools announced they would revert to distance learning starting Wednesday in anticipation of a verdict.\n\nBefore the jury was brought in Thursday, Chauvin, his COVID-19 mask removed in a rare courtroom moment, ended weeks of speculation by informing the judge he would invoke his Fifth Amendment right not to testify.\n\nShortly afterward, the defense rested its case, after a total of two days of testimony, compared with two weeks for the prosecution.\n\nJudge Peter Cahill reminded the jurors they will be sequestered starting Monday and said: \"If I were you, I would plan for long and hope for short.\"\n\nChauvin, 45, is charged with murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death after the 46-year-old Black man was arrested on suspicion of passing a counterfeit $20 at a neighborhood market last May.\n\nBystander video of Floyd gasping that he couldn't breathe as bystanders yelled at Chauvin to get off him triggered worldwide protests, violence and a furious examination of racism and policing in the U.S.\n\nThe most serious charge against the now-fired white officer, second-degree murder, carries up to 40 years in prison, though state guidelines call for about 12.\n\nProsecutors say Floyd died because the officer's knee was pressed against Floyd's neck or close to it for 9 1/2 minutes as he lay on the pavement on his stomach, his hands cuffed behind him and his face jammed against the ground.\n\nLaw enforcement veterans inside and outside the Minneapolis department testified for the prosecution that Chauvin used excessive force and went against his training, while medical experts said Floyd died of asphyxia, or lack of oxygen, because his breathing was constricted by the way he was held down.\n\nChauvin attorney Eric Nelso n called a police use-of-force expert and a forensic pathologist to help make the case that Chauvin acted reasonably against a struggling suspect and that Floyd died because of an underlying heart condition and his illegal drug use. Floyd had high blood pressure and narrowed arteries, and fentanyl and methamphetamine were found in his system.\n\nThe only time Chauvin has been heard defending himself was when the jury listened to body-camera footage from the scene. After an ambulance had taken Floyd away, Chauvin told a bystander: \"We gotta control this guy 'cause he's a sizable guy... and it looks like he's probably on something.\"\n\nThe decision of whether Chauvin should testify carried risks either way."}

But the pair were rarely seen together outside of campaign seasons. In her public comments after Cuomo announced he would step down, Hochul sought to stress her distance from the tainted executive as she prepared to take the reins and launch her own bid for reelection next year.\n\nIn Hochul's first remarks as the governor-in-waiting, on August 11, she stiff-armed Cuomo, promising to ditch any of his aides \"named as doing anything unethical\" in state Attorney General Letitia James' report as part of her efforts to remake a notoriously noxious executive chamber.\n\n\"No one,\" Hochul said, \"will ever describe my administration as a toxic work environment.\"\n\nHochul's ascent coincides with the final act of Cuomo's decade-long run in charge of New York state, a period in which he ruthlessly consolidated power and become a national political star. During the first months of the coronavirus pandemic, his daily televised briefings won him the adoration of Democrats across the country, who held Cuomo up as the fact-driven antithesis of then-President Donald Trump.\n\nBut he burned out spectacularly in the months that followed, when a closer look at his handling of the crisis revealed questionable decision-making – most notably his administration's decision to send Covid-19 patients back to nursing homes – and put a spotlight on his alleged use of state resources to help in writing a triumphal memoir.\n\nBy early this year, the former governor, once believed to be ticketed for a fourth term, was facing mounting allegations of sexual misconduct, which he still denies, and a backlash over the state health department's underreporting of Covid-19-related deaths in nursing homes.\n\nFacing impeachment in the state Assembly and conviction and removal by the state Senate, Cuomo announced nearly two weeks ago that he would step down. Assembly leaders hit pause on their investigation days later but then backtracked, eventually deciding to complete a report outlining their findings. It has not yet been released.\n\nStepping out from Cuomo's long shadow and winning over leaders and lawmakers who clashed with him has been an early priority for Hochul, 62, who will immediately be faced with an onslaught of new and lingering challenges – from rising Covid-19 case rates to speeding up the dispersal of rental assistance and potentially extending the statewide eviction moratorium, which is set to expire on August 31.\n\nReinforcing old relationships and building new ones with the legislature, which was often treated scornfully by Cuomo, could be crucial to Hochul's fate – now and as the next election season comes into focus. Following through on her promise to cast out top Cuomo aides would likely be a welcome start, said Kenneth Sherrill, a professor emeritus of political science at Hunter College.\n\n\"I don't think it's hard to identify the leading thugs. Everybody in Albany can name them and most of the press corps can name them. They have never been shy about making the phone calls or doing it face-to-face,\" Sherrill told CNN. \"That's got to be done. And I think that a lot of it has to do with building up a good relationship with the legislature.\""}

Posts surfaced by Zignal blamed the president for the outages, criticized his response and condemned him for canceling plans for the Keystone XL oil pipeline — though that project, which would have built a crude oil pipeline, would have had no impact on the current situation.\n\nMisleading narratives targeting Biden began picking up speed on Monday, the day North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper became the first of several governors to declare a state of emergency over the disruption.\n\n\"Wouldn't it be weird if the CYBER-ATTACK that shutdown the United States' top fuel line was an INSIDE JOB to pretend Joe Biden isn't responsible for the insane increase in gas price..\" read a widely shared tweet by former Florida congressional candidate Chuck Callesto.\n\n\"People can't complain about gas prices if there's no gas to buy,\" read the caption of an image depicting a sinister Biden with his fingers interlaced, retweeted by U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, a Republican from Colorado.\n\nOther posts claimed the long gas lines across the Southeast U.S. were a harbinger of America's future under Democrats, casting Biden as a socialist in a strategy that Republicans have frequently turned to in recent years.\n\n\"Gas shortages now, food shortages tomorrow?\" tweeted Fox Nation host Tomi Lahren. \"Wow ... starting to feel like socialism is on the way....\"\n\nIn another narrative, posts equated Biden to former President Jimmy Carter who saw his presidency crumble as a result of the 1979 fuel shortage. A statement from former President Donald Trump on Wednesday, amplified by conservative websites including Breitbart News, branded a laundry list of national and global challenges as Biden's fault."}

He struck a curb, mowed down a wooden sign and drove into opposing lanes before hitting a tree and rolling over in Rolling Hills Estates south of downtown Los Angeles. He suffered broken bones in his right leg that could jeopardize his golf career.\n\nAfter hitting the median, he traveled a distance of several hundred feet with no evidence of braking. Woods instead suddenly applied the gas pedal at 99% in the final seconds before hitting the raised median that separates the north and south lanes of the road, according the report. Woods also told investigators he does not remember driving.\n\nJonathan Cherney, a former police detective in Southern California, reviewed the crash scene Feb. 24 and said it was \"like a classic case of falling asleep behind the wheel, because the road curves and his vehicle goes straight.\"\n\nThe collision report boosts that notion, said Cherney, who was not involved in the sheriff's investigation but now works as a forensic crash reconstruction expert."}

But our patience is wearing thin, and your refusal has cost all of us,\" he said, all but biting off his words. The unvaccinated minority \"can cause a lot of damage, and they are.\"\n\nRepublican leaders — and some union chiefs, too — said Biden was going too far in trying to muscle private companies and workers, a certain sign of legal challenges to come.\n\nGov. Henry McMaster of South Carolina said in a statement that \"Biden and the radical Democrats (have) thumbed their noses at the Constitution,\" while American Federation of Government Employees National President Everett Kelley insisted that \"changes like this should be negotiated with our bargaining units where appropriate.\"\n\nOn the other hand, there were strong words of praise for Biden's efforts to get the nation vaccinated from the American Medical Association, the National Association of Manufacturers and the Business Roundtable — though no direct mention of his mandate for private companies.\n\nThe expansive rules mandate that all employers with more than 100 workers require them to be vaccinated or test for the virus weekly, affecting about 80 million Americans. And the roughly 17 million workers at health facilities that receive federal Medicare or Medicaid also will have to be fully vaccinated.\n\nBiden is also requiring vaccination for employees of the executive branch and contractors who do business with the federal government — with no option to test out. That covers several million more workers.\n\nBiden announced the new requirements in a Thursday afternoon address from the White House as part of a new \"action plan\" to address the latest rise in coronavirus cases and the stagnating pace of COVID-19 shots.\n\nJust two months ago Biden prematurely declared the nation's \"independence\" from the virus. Now, despite more than 208 million Americans having at least one dose of the vaccines, the U.S. is seeing about 300% more new COVID-19 infections a day, about two-and-a-half times more hospitalizations, and nearly twice the number of deaths compared to the same time last year. Some 80 million people remain unvaccinated.\n\n\"We are in the tough stretch and it could last for a while,\" Biden said.\n\nAfter months of using promotions to drive the vaccination rate, Biden is taking a much firmer hand, as he blames people who have not yet received shots for the sharp rise in cases killing more than 1,000 people per day and imperiling a fragile economic rebound.\n\nIn addition to the vaccination requirements, Biden moved to double federal fines for airline passengers who refuse to wear masks on flights or to maintain face covering requirements on federal property in accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines."}

Chauvin was convicted in April on state charges of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd's 2020 death. He was sentenced to 22 1/2 years in prison.\n\nChauvin filed documents last month saying he intends to appeal his conviction and sentence on 14 grounds, including that he believes his trial should have been moved from Hennepin County and that the jury should have been sequestered.\n\nHe asked for a public defender to represent him on appeal, but the state Supreme Court denied that request this month, saying a review of his assets and debts showed he was ineligible. When Chauvin made the request, he said he had no income aside from nominal prison wages and that the Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association's legal defense fund, which paid for his initial attorney, told him its obligation to fund his legal representation ended when he was convicted and sentenced.\n\nMohrman, a partner at Minneapolis-based Mohrman, Kaardal & Erickson, did not immediately reply to messages seeking comment. The firm's website says Mohrman's areas of practice include commercial litigation, intellectual property law, First Amendment litigation and employment litigation.\n\nThe firm was involved in a lawsuit in Arizona that sought to vacate the 2020 presidential election results, prompting complaints against Mohrman and others from the Arizona State Bar. The Arizona Republic reported that the complaints were dismissed after the attorneys moved to withdraw their lawsuit, which claimed, among other things, that some \"shadow government\" orchestrated by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg handed out grant money to direct the actions of elections officials.\n\nMohrman's firm is also representing nearly 200 Minnesota health care workers who have sued their employers over COVID-19 vaccine mandates.

How Tom Brady and Matthew Stafford each got to their respective teams is somewhat of a football miracle, but in this timeline the Rams and Bucs look like the two most dangerous teams in the NFC in large thanks because of their quarterbacks.\n\nHow Stafford and Brady were viewed as draft prospects is like comparing apples to sixth round picks but it's always been a marquee matchup whenever the two quarterbacks are playing in the same game. So far, that's only happened twice, with each player winning once, but there were two other near-opportunities that didn't quite happen.\n\n2010 - Stafford sits out\n\nThe first close encounter came in 2010, Matthew Stafford's second season in the NFL. The Detroit Lions hosted the New England Patriots in Week 12 that year, but Stafford went on injured reserve with a shoulder injury after three games and therefore did not play in the game, a 45-24 win for the Patriots.\n\n2014 - When the Lions had the number one defense ... until they had to play the Patriots\n\nIn 2014, the Lions were actually doing well above expectations and they had the top-ranked defense in the NFL going into another Week 12 meeting against the Patriots. Detroit was first against the run and they hadn't given up more than 24 points to any opponent. The Lions 7-3 record at the time was actually considered by some to be a sign that Stafford was holding Detroit back from being a better team.\n\nThat day would not turn out to be Stafford's redemption story, as he went 18-of-46, threw an interception, and the Lions lost 34-9. And to this day, legend has it, the 39-percent completion rate he posted against New England is the lowest of his career.\n\nTom Brady threw for 349 yards, the most by a quarterback against the Lions all year.\n\nDetroit safety James Ihedigbo feigned confusion when a reporter asked if teams had \"figured out\" their defense.\n\n\"What? What are you talking about?\" Ihedigbo said. \"We're the No. 1 defense, what are you talking about figured us out? What does that mean? I don't get it.\"\n\nThe Detroit Free Press also notes in the post-game article that Lions receivers dropped three touchdown passes against the Patriots. Said Stafford:\n\n\"You play a good team like New England, the whole team has to play well and we didn't.\"\n\nThe Lions ended up winning the next four games and made the playoffs at 11-5, losing in the wild card round to the Dallas Cowboys, 24-20.\n\nThe Patriots won the Super Bowl.\n\n2018 - Stafford gets redemption, and Matt Patricia borrows some of it from him\n\nDetroit and New England would meet again in 2018 and this time the face-off that everyone was talking about was first-year Lions head coach Matt Patricia against his old boss Bill Belichick.\n\nThe Lions were 0-2 and facing the Patriots on Sunday Night Football, but Stafford was prepared for the moment. Stafford said before the game that he wasn't focused on Brady, but on New England's defense:\n\n\"(I) just want to go out there and play my best for my team, and no doubt it'll be against their defense and not him. But they're just a really good football team, so we're looking forward to playing against a really good football team,\" he said."}

After looking below average in his first two starts, Brady found his stride, leading the team, which started 0-2, to an 11-5 record. In the Super Bowl, the Rams scored to make it a 17-17 game with 1:30 remaining. Brady led a drive down the field with no timeouts, setting up a game-winning 48-yard field goal by Adam Vinatieri as time expired. Despite lackluster numbers, the 24-year-old Brady was named the game's MVP.\n\nSuper Bowl XXXVIII\n\nWhen: Feb. 1, 2004\n\nFinal: New England Patriots 32, Carolina Panthers 29\n\nLocation: Reliant Stadium, Houston, Texas\n\nCrowd: 71,525\n\nBrady's line: 32-for-48, 354 yards, 3 TDs, 1 INT\n\nSignificance: After missing the playoffs the prior year, Brady and the Patriots rolled to a 14-2 record. The Super Bowl was scoreless after one quarter, with Brady collecting just 43 yards passing. However, in the second quarter, Brady passed for 101 yards and a touchdown, including a 52-yarder to Deion Branch. In the fourth quarter, Brady connected with linebacker Mike Vrabel, who was in as an eligible receiver, on a 1-yard touchdown pass. For the second time, Brady was named the game's MVP.\n\nSuper Bowl XXXIX\n\nWhen: Feb. 6, 2005\n\nFinal: New England Patriots 24, Philadelphia Eagles 21\n\nLocation: Alltel Stadium, Jacksonville, Florida\n\nCrowd: 78,125\n\nBrady's line: 23-for-33, 236 yards, 2 TDs\n\nSignificance: Brady connected with his favorite early-career target Deion Branch for a then Super Bowl-tying record 11 receptions for 133 yards. Branch would be named the game's MVP. Brady also would again connect with linebacker Mike Vrabel on a touchdown. And for the third time in four years, the Patriots won a Super Bowl by three points, each being won by the foot of Adam Vinatieri.\n\nSuper Bowl XLII\n\nWhen: Feb. 3, 2008\n\nFinal: New York Giants 17, New England Patriots 14\n\nLocation: University of Phoenix Stadium, Glendale, Arizona\n\nCrowd: 71,101\n\nBrady's line: 29-for-48, 266 yards, 1 TD\n\nSignificance: After a two-year Super Bowl absence, Brady and the Patriots returned to the game with perhaps their best team yet.

So why shouldn't the Super Bowl MVP trophy be named after a player?\n\nWe'll get to the results in a minute, but first I wanted to share some of the great feedback as to why some people agreed, and why some didn't.\n\nTom from Ohio, would like to see the trophy renamed, sharing this thought: \"It's not the Most Valuable Commissioner award?\"\n\nDerrick from Virginia agreed but offered this on how to continue to honor Rozelle: \"The Rozelle Trophy should be for the coach or general manager of the year. Or franchise of the year award.\"\n\nRozelle had his defenders.\n\nJim from Massachusetts stuck up for Rozelle then made the most common argument I received against renaming the trophy: \"First, it would be extremely disrespectful to Pete Rozelle. More importantly, Tom Brady was found guilty and sanctioned by the league for his role in cheating. That's not someone that should have a trophy such as this named after him. Some of his cheating helped him achieve what he has.\"\n\nJim, of course, references the 2015 controversy where footballs in an AFC Championship game were found to be under the NFL's gauge pressure requirement. Brady was suspended the first four games the following year after a lengthy investigation.\n\nOthers chimed in to say yes and refute the Deflategate argument, pointing out the Wells report convicted Brady with statements like: \"The investigation concluded that it was 'more probable than not' that New England Patriots equipment personnel were deliberately circumventing the rules.\"\n\nThat's an argument for another day.\n\nThe most common response for renaming the trophy for Brady was simply, \"He's the GOAT.\"\n\nThat phrase has become a bit tired and overused during the past few weeks, but in this survey it was used dozens of times.\n\nAnother common suggestion was summed up well by Rich in Venice, Florida: \"I'd wait until TB12 retires and then, after 5 years, rename it.\"\n\nMany didn't think it was a good idea to rename it while he was still playing.\n\nChris from North Carolina took it a step further with a \"no\" vote — for now: \"That decision should not be considered until Tom is enshrined in the Hall of Fame .. it is important to respect the history of the game ... but great idea.\"\n\nI had to make sure those last three words got in there.\n\nMatt from Indiana is against it despite being a fan: \"I love Brady but he did not win the Super Bowls by himself.

He killed two unarmed people\n\nKyle Rittenhouse, who shot three men at a riot in Kenosha, killing two of them, was acquitted of all criminal charges.\n\nHe has been hailed as a hero. He has been feted by politicians, including Donald Trump. He has been compared to John Wayne as a symbol of law-abiding people fighting back against lawlessness. When he took a rifle to a protest over the earlier police shooting that left Jacob Blake paralyzed, Rittenhouse said his intention was to protect property against violence.\n\nBut the two men Rittenhouse killed were unarmed. John Wayne never shot an unarmed man.\n\nRittenhouse was acquitted because of changes in the legal understanding of self-defense in recent years. Based on the Rittenhouse verdict, the rest of us are now unsafe around anyone with a gun.\n\nRittenhouse had been guarding an auto dealership at which several cars had been set on fire when he was confronted by Joseph Rosenbaum, the first man Rittenhouse killed. Evidence showed that Rosenbaum was aggressive and lunged for Rittenhouse's rifle while cursing him. Rittenhouse testified that he feared that Rosenbaum would seize the rifle and shoot him. The jury found this fear to be reasonable and this may be a fair interpretation of the current law of self-defense in Wisconsin.\n\nBut that is precisely the problem. No one actually knows what Rosenbaum intended. Rittenhouse admitted that he pointed his rifle at him. Rosenbaum might have intended simply to disarm a dangerous man.\n\nThe acquittal means that the person holding the gun gets to decide who lives and who dies.\n\nYou can see where this interpretation of self-defense can lead in the trial of the three men who were convicted of killing Ahmaud Arbery, an unarmed black jogger running through a suburb of Brunswick, Georgia. One of the men charged, Travis McMichael, said that Arbery lunged for his gun.\n\nMcMichael was convicted of malice murder, so this defense failed. But George Barnhill, the second prosecutor in the case, who later recused himself, refused to prosecute on just this basis: \"at the point Arbery grabbed the shotgun, under Georgia Law, [Travis] McMichael was allowed to use deadly force to protect himself.\"\n\nJohn Wayne would not have shot a man he knew was unarmed, as Rittenhouse did. The Duke would have defended himself against non-lethal force by the use of his fists.\n\nAfter Rittenhouse killed Rosenbaum, he made a phone call to a friend saying that he had just killed someone. He did not seek medical attention for the man on the ground. He did not call the police. Instead, he continued his armed patrolling.\n\nAnthony Huber, the second man killed, considered Rittenhouse to be dangerous. Huber's girlfriend said in an interview that Huber rushed Rittenhouse to protect her and others nearby. Huber struck Rittenhouse with a skateboard he always carried and reached for Rittenhouse's rifle. That is when Rittenhouse shot him once, fatally wounding him.\n\nClearly, Huber was not trying to shoot Rittenhouse, but to disarm him. As the events of that night demonstrated, he was not wrong to fear that Rittenhouse was irresponsibly dangerous. Huber's courage cost him his life.\n\nJohn Wayne would not have fired his weapon at Huber, just as John Wayne would have led the police to Rosenbaum's body.\n\nIronically, there was someone in Kenosha that night who embodied the grace and restraint of John Wayne—Gaige Grosskreutz, the man Rittenhouse wounded after killing Huber.\n\nGrosskreutz, who was at the protest to provide medical care, and who was carrying a handgun, was told that Rittenhouse had shot someone and was trying to get away. He saw Rittenhouse fire at Huber and moved directly toward him with his own gun visible. He and Rittenhouse confronted each other. Grosskreutz did not fire. Rittenhouse did.\n\nRittenhouse did not hesitate to shoot, did not assess the situation, did not act like an adult who understood the responsibility of possessing a firearm.\n\nRittenhouse is alive today because Grosskreutz did not shoot. By the jury's reasoning, he had every right to kill Rittenhouse as they pointed guns at each other.\n\nThis is where the madness of the current interpretation of self-defense has brought us."}

To render a verdict, they also had to interpret Minneapolis Police policies, Floyd's cause of death, and the specific language of the law.\n\nThe jury found Chauvin, 45, guilty of all three charges – second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. He could face up to 40 years in prison for second-degree murder, up to 25 years for third-degree murder, and up to 10 years for second-degree manslaughter.\n\nThe actual sentences would likely be much lower, though, because Chauvin has no prior convictions. Minnesota's sentencing guidelines recommend about 12.5 years in prison for each murder charge and about four years for the manslaughter charge. The judge would ultimately decide the exact length and whether those would be served at the same time or back-to-back.\n\nThe second-degree unintentional murder charge alleged Chauvin caused Floyd's death \"without intent\" while committing or attempting to commit felony third-degree assault. In turn, third-degree assault is defined as the intentional infliction of substantial bodily harm.\n\nThe third-degree murder charge alleged Chauvin caused Floyd's death by \"perpetrating an act eminently dangerous to others and evincing a depraved mind, without regard for human life.\"\n\nThe second-degree manslaughter charge alleged Chauvin caused Floyd's death by \"culpable negligence whereby the person creates an unreasonable risk, and consciously takes chances of causing death or great bodily harm.\"\n\nEach of the three charges required prosecutors to prove that Chauvin's actions were not objectively reasonable and that they were a substantial cause of Floyd's death. But the charges differ primarily in how they interpret his intent and mindset during his restraint of Floyd.\n\nA still image from bystander video shows former officer Derek Chauvin while kneeling on George Floyd on May 25, 2020. From Darnella Frazier\n\nSome of the terms in these charges have specific definitions. Others were left up to the jury to interpret.\n\nAs in any criminal case, the prosecution had the burden of proof and had to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nWhat the charges have in common\n\nCentral to all of the charges is the element of causation, or that Chauvin was a substantial causal factor in Floyd's death."}

Now we know he a lot more than an arthroscopic procedure in February.\n\nBrady tore the anterior cruciate ligament in the same knee during Week 1 of the 2008 season.\n\nThe MCL is a band of tissue that runs along the inner edge of the knee. It helps to connect the shin and thigh bones to keep the knee stable and working properly during movement.\n\nThe risk of playing with a torn MCL is that the knee can become hyperextended easily and bend in the wrong direction.

The cost may be included on Texans' gas bills for up to the next 30 years.\n\nThe move, approved unanimously by the three Railroad Commission members, was the most recent step in a process state legislators approved last spring known as \"securitization.\" It essentially turned blackout-related debt owed to natural gas companies and others into low-interest bonds guaranteed by the state.\n\nThose bonds are then paid back over decades by charging higher bills to consumers. The Railroad Commission vote today approved the issuance of those bonds by another state group, the Texas Public Finance Authority.\n\nDuring the winter storm, tight gas supply and high demand translated into historic high prices as utilities struggled to bring gas to residential customers and electric companies scrambled to secure fuel for their power plants.\n\nAt times, gas traded 150 times higher than it had before the crisis.\n\nThose prices made massive profits for gas companies,estimated at $11 billion earlier this year by Bloomberg News. They also led to accusations of price gouging, which would have been illegal if it had been been applied to other products like gasoline.\n\n\"It would be like you're going to fill up your gas tank during the storm ... and instead of paying $50-ish to fill up your tank, the register there reads: 'Give me $6,000 to $7,000,'\" Paula Gold-Williams, former head of San Antonio's publicly owned utility, told KUT in July.\n\nTexas' regulated gas distribution utilities, which don't make money from higher fuel costs, typically pass those costs on to consumers. For those utilities and their ratepayers, securitization was pitched as a way to spread out the pain of paying the massive price tag of the blackout.\n\nWhile the Railroad Commission approved the securitization of $3.4 billion, it remains unclear exactly how much individual ratepayers will see their monthly bills increase and when.\n\nTexas Gas Service, which services the Austin area and is the state's third largest gas distributor, says it doesn't know yet what the impact on customers' bills will be.\n\n\"The Railroad Commission has 90 days to issue a financing order which instructs the Texas Public Finance Authority to issue bonds,\" Texas Gas Service said in an email. \"After that, the Texas Public Finance Authority has 180 days to issue the bonds.

Having seen Rittenhouse already kill one man, he assumed he would be next.\n\n\"I was never trying to kill the defendant,\" Grosskreutz said. \"That was never something I was trying to do. In that moment, I was trying to preserve my own life. But doing so, also, taking the life of another is not something I am capable or comfortable of doing. It goes against almost a lifelong ethical code in regards to medicine.\"\n\nIn putting a human face on what had so far been a video-heavy case that centered around very technical legal questions, Grosskreutz seemed to bolster Rittenhouse's self-defense claim as he testified that he believed some people chasing Rittenhouse down the street intended to hurt the teen. He also confirmed he had a gun in his right hand as he took a step toward Rittenhouse.\n\nGrosskreutz, 28, told the jury he did not chase Rittenhouse that night as the defense argues. He acknowledged, however, that he reached for the teen's AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle just before Rittenhouse shot him in the arm.\n\nWearing a hat with \"paramedic\" printed on it during protests, Grosskreutz testified, he and a friend had organized a medical corps to help people needing assistance at demonstrations in Milwaukee during the summer of 2020 after George Floyd's death. He also traveled to Kenosha on Aug. 25 to provide medic services to people protesting the shooting days earlier of Jacob Blake, a Black man, by a white police officer.\n\nLike Rittenhouse, Grosskreutz carried a gun and provided first aid to people injured during the demonstrations. But unlike Rittenhouse — a 17-year-old lifeguard who misled people about his age and emergency medical technician certification — Grosskreutz obtained his firearm through proper channels and was certified as an EMT.\n\nRittenhouse volunteered as an armed security guard for a Kenosha used car lot after businesses had been burned and vandalized during demonstrations the previous day. He left his post and his partner shortly before midnight and encountered Joseph Rosenbaum, who one witness described as a \"babbling idiot\" saying provocative things and shouting racial slurs at various times throughout the evening."}

Trump\n\nThe biography for President Trump and past presidents is courtesy of the White House Historical Association.\n\nDonald John Trump was born in Queens, New York, on June 14, 1946. His father, Fred Trump was a successful real estate developer. Trump was educated at the New York Military Academy and the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 1971, he took over his father's real estate company, renaming it the Trump Organization. The business soon became involved in variety of projects, including hotels, resorts, residential and commercial building, casinos, and golf courses. His first of many books was The Art of the Deal, published in 1987. In 2004, he launched the reality television show The Apprentice.\n\nIn 2005, Donald Trump married Melania Knauss. They have one son, Barron. Trump also has four adult children from previous marriages: Donald Jr., Ivanka, Eric, and Tiffany.\n\nDuring the 2016 primary, Trump defeated more than a dozen rivals to win the Republican nomination. While he lost the popular vote, Trump defeated former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the general election by winning a majority of Electoral College votes. His campaign slogan was \"Make America Great Again.\"\n\nWithout previous elected political experience, President Trump used unconventional methods to communicate his priorities. Most notably, he used the social media platform Twitter as a primary mechanism for direct communication with the American public, other politicians, and the press corps.\n\nAs president, he signed a major tax reform bill into law and oversaw a reduction of federal regulations. His protectionist trade policies included tariffs in foreign aluminum, steel, and other products. The Trump administration also renegotiated trade agreements with Mexico, Canada, China, Japan, and South Korea. Other domestic priorities included Supreme Court and federal judiciary appointments, increased military budgets, aggressive border and immigration control, criminal justice reform, and the reduction of prescription drug prices.\n\nIn foreign policy, the Trump administration moved the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and brokered normalization agreements between Israel and a number of countries. In 2018, President Trump attended a summit with Kim Jong Un, marking the first time a sitting president met with a North Korean leader.\n\nIn 2018, there was a partial government shutdown as Trump disagreed with Congress over funding for a border wall between the United States and Mexico. The funding lapse lasted thirty-five days before it was resolved."}

It is being created through a new company formed by a merger of the TMTG and a special acquisition company.\n\nThe social media platform is the first of the three stages in the company's plans, followed by a subscription video-on-demand service called TMTG+ that will feature entertainment, news and podcasts, and an entry to the cloud-computing space, according to the release.\n\nTrump, who was impeached by the US House of Representatives for his role in egging on rioters on January 6, but later acquitted of the charges in the then Republican-controlled US Senate, has been vocal about his desire to launch his own media platform following his presidency.\n\nAn earlier effort to launch a blog on his existing website was abandoned after the page drew dismal views.\n\nIn May, a semi-independent Facebook oversight board upheld Trump's suspension from the site, on which he had about 35 million followers, while criticising the open-ended nature of the ban and calling for the company to determine a more concrete timeline of the ban within six months.\n\nIn July, Trump sued Facebook, Twitter and Google, along with their chief executives, seeking the restoration of his accounts and punitive damages."}

At least one platoon found its gear locked in a bus that couldn't be opened, forcing its members to return to the front line without shields.\n\nThe Capitol riot prompted one of the worst days for US law-enforcement injuries since the 9/11 attacks, The New York Times reported in May. Seventy-three Capitol Police officers and 65 officers with the DC Metropolitan Police Department were injured. One died.\n\nThe bus incident was one of many failures that led the Capitol Police, or USCP, to six months ago cede control to a mob, which threw objects at them and battered them with flag poles.\n\nThe department maintains that it had no way of knowing what was to come. But evidence that emerged since January shows the scale of what was missed.\n\nDrawing on congressional testimony, official reports, legal documents, and original interviews, Insider can tell the extent of the dysfunction and confusion that led to insurrection on US soil.\n\nWhat came as a surprise to those on the front line was in fact anything but: Analysts had been tracking the mass movement of Trump supporters to Washington and reading plans for a military-style operation.\n\nHad that information been acted on, perhaps the trashing of US democracy — not to mention the deaths and injuries that day — could have been avoided.\n\nAn insurrection planned in the open\n\nThe violence on January 6 had been planned online, visible to anyone who knew where to look.\n\nAmong those watching was the Network Contagion Research Institute, a nonprofit that tracks disinformation.

But in a detailed explanation posted on its blog Friday, the company said recent Trump tweets amounted to glorification of violence when read in the context of the Capitol riot and plans circulating online for future armed protests around the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden.\n\nThe social platform has been under growing pressure to take further action against Trump following the Wednesday violence. On Thursday, Facebook suspended Trump's account through Jan. 20 and possibly indefinitely. Twitter merely suspended Trump's account for 12 hours after he posted a video that repeated false claims about election fraud and praised the rioters who stormed the Capitol.\n\nTrump's Twitter persona has long functioned as a mix of policy announcements, often out of the blue; complaints about the media; disparagement of women, minorities and his perceived enemies; and praise for his supporters, replete with exclamation marks, all-caps, and one-word declarations such as \"Sad!\"\n\nHe has fired numerous officials on Twitter and his posts, like his speeches at rallies, are a torrent of misinformation.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Twitter declined to make CEO Jack Dorsey available and had no further comment.\n\nThe official account for the President of the United States, @POTUS, remains live. In fact, Trump, who issued a statement Friday evening that denounced Twitter as an enemy of free speech and floated the idea that he might build his own \"platform,\" also posted it on the @POTUS account, where it was quickly deleted.\n\nTwitter says using another account to evade a suspension is against its rules, and that while it won't ban government accounts like @POTUS or @WhiteHouse, it will \"take action to limit their use.\"\n\nShannon McGregor, an assistant professor of journalism and media at the University of North Carolina, said the move lets Twitter try to curry favor with the incoming Biden administration. Trump \"only has two weeks left in power, and that certainly makes it easier to deplatform the president,\" she said.\n\nOthers saw a more ominous portent in Twitter's action. \"Big Tech is not going to stop with the president of the United States,\" Kay James, president of the conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation, wrote in a tweet. \"They can ban you next and everyone reading this.\"\n\nIn the Trump tweets cited by Twitter, Trump stated that he will not be attending the inauguration and referred to his supporters as \"American Patriots,\" saying they will have \"a GIANT VOICE long into the future.\" Twitter said these statements \"are likely to inspire others to replicate the violent acts that took place on January 6, 2021, and that there are multiple indicators that they are being received and understood as encouragement to do so.\"\n\nTwitter said its policy enables world leaders to speak to the public, but that these accounts \"are not above our rules entirely\" and can't use Twitter to incite violence. Trump had roughly 89 million followers. Twitter shares fell roughly 4% in after-hours trading, reflecting concerns that the Trump ban might reduce usage and advertising sales.\n\nJonathan Greenblatt, who heads the Anti-Defamation League, said Friday that banning Trump was an \"excellent step\" and \"a fitting end to a legacy of spewing hate and vitriol.\" The ADL was part of a coalition of civil rights and advocacy groups on Friday calling for Twitter to ban Trump's account.\n\nTwitter, long accused of treating the president with kid gloves, began policing Trump more aggressively starting in the early days of the general presidential campaign, when the company began aggressively labeling his false tweets about supposedly widespread election fraud as disputed. An actual permanent suspension had been all but unimaginable -- at least until he lost his bid for re-election.\n\nIn May, after Trump tweeted the phrase \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts\" in response to protests in Minneapolis, Twitter added a warning label to his post for the first time. Tensions between Trump and Twitter only escalated from there.\n\nBanning Trump entirely was a big step for the company — if one that it avoided taking until the president was a lame duck and its larger rival, Facebook, already banned him indefinitely."}

While there's some support from Democratic lawmakers for recurring payments, the party has slim majorities in the House and Senate and limiting the third round of payments was a key priority for moderates during negotiations of the latest pandemic relief package passed in March.\n\nInstead, lawmakers are focused on a massive infrastructure bill that could be taken up this summer. A bipartisan-backed outline of the package released last week does not include any direct payments. President Joe Biden is also pushing Congress to pass his American Families Plan, but that doesn't call for a fourth round of stimulus payments, either. Instead, it calls for making community college free, child care more affordable and provide guaranteed paid sick and family leave.\n\nBut there's still some pandemic aid already approved by Congress making its way to American families. The Internal Revenue Service is making payment adjustments for people who lost income during 2020 and are due more money than they originally received, and some families are set to receive advanced payments of the expanded child tax credit. Some people are still receiving the federal boost to unemployment benefits, though several states have ended that those payments early in an effort to get people back to work.\n\nStimulus payment adjustments still going out\n\nMost of the third round of payments have been delivered, but some money is still being sent to those who lost income during 2020 and qualified for more than they had initially received.\n\nKnown as \"plus-up\" payments, the money goes automatically to people whose 2020 tax returns show they missed out when the first two rounds of checks – which were sent based on 2019 tax filings – went out. More than 8 million people received these extra payments this year.\n\nThe government is also still sending payments to people whom the IRS did not previously have enough information for but who recently filed tax returns. Many of those are very low-income people who aren't normally required to file tax returns because their incomes fall below the filing threshold. They were encouraged to file this year to claim the stimulus money they are eligible for.\n\nMore money is on the way for families with children\n\nThe pandemic aid package passed in March also increased the size of the child tax credit. Those payments will be sent periodically beginning July 15.\n\nMore than 36 million families may be eligible for the payments. Most won't have to do anything to receive the money, which will be based on information provided on the 2020 or 2019 tax returns.\n\nParents can now check their eligibility online using a new IRS tool as well as opt out of monthly payments, instead receiving the full credit as a lump sum when they file their tax return next year. Low-income families who don't normally file taxes can also register for the payments online.\n\nThose payments will technically be an advance on a 2021 tax credit. Eligible parents will receive $3,600 for each child under 6 and $3,000 for each child under age 18. Until now, the credit was up to only $2,000 per child under age 17. At least half of the amount will go out over the summer and the remainder will be lumped in with next year's tax refund.\n\nThe enhanced portion of the credit will be available for single parents with annual incomes up to $75,000 and joint filers making up to $150,000 a year."}

I mean what do you do?\n\nIda has been depreciated from a furious Category 4 hurricane to a Category 3 tropical storm, but its remnants are still expected to bring two to five inches of rain to the flood-battered town.\n\nAnderson is scared. On Saturday, 17 inches of rain caused local creeks to swell and form a flash flood that killed 20 people and damaged hundreds of homes.\n\nJohn Cohen, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Nashville, is watching Ida as she's set to curve toward Middle Tennessee later Monday night and Tuesday.\n\nTropical Storm Ida: Remnants to bring up to 5 inches of rain to Middle TN — including flood-hit areas\n\nWaverly floods: Waverly residents request prayers after deadly floods — for themselves and others\n\n\"Now as she moves our way she is going to weaken into a depression,\" Cohen said. \"So the system overall is weakening but it is going to bring a lot of rain up here.\"\n\nThe forecast has Waverly in a flash flood watch, as it's expected the city will receive 24 hours of continuous moderate to heavy rain, starting late Monday afternoon into Tuesday night.\n\nNotice of the coming rain was hard to hear for longtime residents like Anderson and her sister, Rachel Story, who lost her home in a 2019 flood.\n\nWhen Story heard news of Ida, her first thought was: \"Here we go again.\"\n\nLast week's high temperatures and commanding sun helped heal some homes, beginning to dry out lawns and growing debris. But the remnants of the tropical storm threaten to hinder the town as it tries to trudge forward.\n\nGretchen Turner cleaned and power washed her garage to prepare for the few inches of rain coming her way. On Monday, Turner, 59, continued the grueling task of deciding what few belongings she wanted to salvage -- what was most dear to her. She's covering whatever else she can with tarps.\n\n\"It's sort of demoralizing when you're working so hard and then everything gets wet,\" Turner said with glossing eyes. \"...We still have lots of dirt everywhere, but its about to be mud again, you know. So things are gonna get just dirty again.\"\n\nThe wood that made Gretchen Turner's home, along with the kitchen cabinets, the leather couch, the suitcases, nearly everything that once lived inside has been gutted. It's now piled onto her front lawn.\n\n\"There's no point in tarping this,\" Turner said pointing to the growing pile of her destroyed furniture and belongings. \"I wish they'd pick it up.\"\n\nIn the last four days, volunteer agencies, the National Guard and the Tennessee Department of Transportation have hauled over 800 truck loads of debris to a landfill in Humphreys County, said Grey Collier, spokesperson for the the county's Emergency Management Agency.\n\nAs the remnants of Ida head toward town, Collier said the agencies will continue to remove debris, including what's lodged in the creek. The hope is to prevent any blockage that could cause the creek to swell.\n\n\"It shouldn't be a problem, but I kind of feel like everybody in those areas might have a little bit of post traumatic going on,\" Collier said. \"And just with rain coming in, that might, you know trigger a little bit of nervousness.\"\n\nMost hope that the coming rain won't spur any more physical damage to the town, but emotionally-- it's been done. While volunteers continues to work toward rebuilding, many are exhausted.\n\nAs people linger in Waverly Café, a coffeehouse in the center of town, owner Scott Daniel is able to take a pulse on how his neighbors are dealing with the disaster in front of them.\n\n\"It comes in waves,\" he said. \"They'll be good, then they'll have those little breakdowns, because it is just overwhelming. They're still lost and not really sure where to go or what to do.\"\n\nWaverly Police Department will be keeping an eye on the creek and is prepared to help families leave their homes if they need to, although they don't expect that evacuation will be necessary, said Grey Collier, spokesperson for the Humphreys County Emergency Management Agency.\n\nDespite the minimal expected rainfall, some have a plan set in case the rain escalates, like it did last Saturday.\n\n\"I already got my bag packed and everything so I'm ready to roll,\" said Tara Anthony, whose home was damaged by the flood. \"You never know.\""}

While many people with COVID-19 get mild symptoms, others can become seriously ill. Several vaccines have been developed to protect against COVID-19. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has so far authorized three COVID-19 vaccines for emergency use. Two of these are the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. Both of these vaccines require two doses. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine has also been authorized for emergency use. However, this vaccine only requires one dose. Why do some vaccines require two doses? How long do you need to wait between doses? Do you have any immunity after the first dose? This article will help explain why you need two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, and will provide answers to many other questions, too.\n\nHow do these vaccines work? The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines both use mRNA technology. The cells in your body naturally use mRNA all the time to create many different types of proteins that you need to stay healthy. The mRNA in the two-dose COVID-19 vaccines provide the cells of your body with instructions on how to make the spike protein that's specific to the new coronavirus. This spike protein is found on the surface of the virus. It uses this spike protein to attach to and enter a host cell in your body. When you get your COVID-19 vaccine, your immune system processes information on the spike protein and generates an immune response to it. This includes the production of antibodies. Vaccines hinge on a very important aspect of your immune system, which is the fact that it has memory. After your vaccination, your immune system continues to store information on the spike protein. If you're exposed to the new coronavirus, your immune system will then use this stored information to respond and protect you from the virus. This can help prevent you from becoming sick with COVID-19. The entire immunity process typically takes around 2 weeks after the second dose of vaccine. That's why you can still contract the new coronavirus and become ill if you're exposed to it shortly after getting your vaccine."}

Pat Toomey (R., Pa.) on Capitol Hill in Washington on the last day of former President Donald Trump's second Senate impeachment trial. Toomey was one of seven Republicans who voted to convict Trump. Read more\n\nPennsylvania Republicans have voted to rebuke Sen. Pat Toomey but stopped short of a formal censure, two weeks after Toomey was one of just seven Republicans who voted to convict Donald Trump in the former president's impeachment trial.\n\nThe narrow GOP vote Monday, after technical problems derailed the effort last week, crystallized some of the anger at Toomey and reflected Trump's tight grip as he positions himself as the party's dominant force in the coming years.\n\nBut it also showed fissures, as some Trump supporters were left furious that the party didn't approve a censure of Toomey.\n\n\"We are outraged that Senator Toomey took part in an impeachment process that facilitated Democrats' tireless obsession with partisan political retribution,\" read a statement approved by the Pennsylvania Republican Party in a vote of state committee members. The statement was one of two options they voted on; the other included a formal censure of Toomey.\n\nThe Inquirer obtained copies of the two competing statements Republicans voted on and the final tally, though they were not made public or released as of late Tuesday afternoon. The state GOP's Twitter account has been dormant since Feb. 13, when it posted a statement from chairman Lawrence Tabas expressing \"disappointment\" in Toomey's impeachment vote.\n\nToomey's office declined to comment on the vote to rebuke the senator.\n\n\"Democrats used impeachment as a political weapon, which set a dangerous precedent in America, and Senator Toomey did not stand in their way,\" the winning GOP statement said. \"We oppose the Senator's actions in the strongest terms, but we have faith that the voters will properly address public officials who do not satisfactorily represent the best interests of this nation.\"\n\nThe statement instead went on to take the unusual step of censuring four Pennsylvania Democrats: Gov. Tom Wolf, Attorney General Josh Shapiro, former Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar, and former Health Secretary Rachel Levine, criticizing their handling of the 2020 election, the response to the coronavirus, and other matters.\n\n\"This body has concluded that censure action should be reserved for those who work every day to destroy the most exceptional nation in the world,\" the Republican statement said in targeting the Democrats.\n\nWhile the censures and admonitions are symbolic, especially since Toomey isn't seeking reelection, it was especially unusual for the GOP to censure Democrats, who would have no reason to expect support from the Republican political apparatus.\n\nPennsylvania Democrats saw the Republican message as an opening.\n\n\"With tonight's vote to rebuke Senator Toomey, Pennsylvania Republicans have sent a loud and clear message: they are the party of Donald Trump, QAnon, anti-American extremists and the Big Lie — and dissent will never be tolerated,\" state Democratic Party chairwoman Nancy Patton Mills said in a statement. \"If you are turned off by the chaos and extremism of the GOP, we invite you to join our fight for a better Pennsylvania.\"\n\nInside the Pennsylvania Republican Party, the vote against Toomey, a staunch fiscal conservative who voted with Trump about 85% of the time, sent a signal about the GOP's outlook as it faces Trump's defeat and competitive races for governor and Senate in 2022.\n\nThe vote was 128-124 in favor of a statement that did not censure Toomey, with 13 abstentions. Party members had to choose between one statement that censured Toomey and one that admonished him. Both versions included a censure of Democrats. There was no option for voting against criticizing Toomey.\n\nSome Republicans were furious that the party didn't go as far in punishing Toomey as state parties did in North Carolina and Louisiana, where GOP senators also voted to convict."}

The campaign is also calling on Pfizer, BioNTech, and Moderna to share mRNA technology with the new World Health Organization-backed transfer hub based in South Africa.\n\nThis certainly won't be the first time The Duke and Duchess have raised their voices about the issue of vaccine equity. As co-chairs of Global Citizen's VAX LIVE: The Concert to Reunite the World in May — which called on world leaders, corporations, and philanthropists to ensure vaccines are available to all — they penned an open letter to Big Pharma CEOs, calling on them to urgently share COVID-19 vaccines with the world's poorest countries.\n\n\"The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated health, social, and economic inequality globally,\" they wrote. \"The global vaccine rollout thus far further deepens these disparities, with the poorest and most marginalized populations most adversely impacted.\"\n\nAnd to celebrate their son Archie's second birthday, they led a global fundraising effort to support Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which is co-leading the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX) Facility to get vaccines to people in low-income countries who need them most. The initiative — thanks in part to donations matched by Mastercard Impact Fund, Seadream Family Foundation, and a public charity — ultimately mobilized $3.5 million.\n\n\"The virus does not respect borders, and access to the vaccine cannot be determined by geography,\" Prince Harry said on the VAX LIVE stage. \"It must be accepted as a basic right for all and that is our starting point.\"\n\nMonths later, vaccine equity remains a dire issue. Coronavirus variants are spreading across the world, people in poor nations still can't access vaccinations or treatments, and rich countries continue to hoard vaccines as they move forward with COVID-19 booster plans (despite the World Health Organization and other health experts saying such plans at this stage will only exacerbate extreme vaccine inequity). The Duke and Duchess' message is sure to be one world leaders need to hear.\n\nAdditional appearances announced Tuesday for the global broadcast event include United Nations Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed, World Health Organization Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, World Food Programme Executive Director David Beasley, Education Cannot Wait Director Yasmine Sherif, Namati CEO Vivek Maru, Rotary President-elect Jennifer Jones, SDG Champion and Advocate Eddie Ndopu, Ford Foundation President Darren Walker, Paris Peace Forum Steering Committee President Trisha Shetty, Hip Hop Caucus President and CEO Rev. Lennox Yearwood Jr., UN Next Generation Fellow Valeria Colunga, advocate Eunice Akoth, and more.\n\nAs part of our year-long Recovery Plan for the World campaign, Global Citizen Live will showcase a day of unity spanning seven continents, bringing together more than 70 artists, activists, and world leaders to defend the planet and defeat poverty."}

(AP) — The land on which Audrey Trufant Salvant's home sits in the small Louisiana town of Ironton has become an island in a sea of mud and snake-infested marsh grass. Nearby houses are disconnected from their foundations, a refrigerator is lodged sideways in a tree, and dozens of caskets and tombs from two nearby cemeteries are strewn across lawns for blocks. The entire town is without power and running water.\n\nA month after Hurricane Ida roared ashore with 150-mph (241-kph) winds, communities all along the state's southeastern coast — Ironton, Grand Isle, Houma, Lafitte and Barataria — are still suffering from the devastating effects of the Category 4 storm.\n\nMany, like Trufant Salvant, are bunking with relatives until they can get back into their homes. Others are staying in hotels or have left the state, she said. Some residents have returned to pick up what few belongings may have survived the flood, but she says they aren't finding much to salvage — the storm surge generated by Ida rose as high as some homes' rooftops.\n\n\"The day that they allowed folks to come back in here, it was like a funeral,\" she said. \"Everybody was just heartbroken, because we had seen devastation before ... but we had never seen anything like this.\"\n\nChurches and charity organizations are working to help, but the destruction is so far-reaching, there don't seem to be enough donations to go around, said Michael Williamson, head of the United Way of Southeast Louisiana, which covers seven parishes hit by Ida.\n\nThe storage room in the United Way's New Orleans headquarters — typically filled with donated food, water, tarps and cleaning supplies for residents in storm-battered communities — is nearly bare. Donations have been slow to trickle in compared to previous storms, even smaller ones, and there's not enough to meet the demand, Williamson said.\n\nWhen it comes to tarps and cleaning supplies — bleach, buckets, mops and rakes — \"we can't get enough of them,\" he said.\n\nThe United Way is also managing unique cases including that of firefighter Warren Myers, whose 5-year-old special needs daughter, Ameah, requires a specific formula administered through a feeding tube, medicine to control seizures, and diapers, all of which are expensive and have been hard to get since Ida.\n\nStore shelves haven't been as well stocked, and deliveries haven't arrived as regularly as usual, said Crystal Hagger, Myers' fiancée, who helps care for Ameah.\n\nAmeah is unable to stand or walk on her own, so the couple carry her everywhere either in their arms or on their backs with a harness-style carrier.\n\nThe family was recently told the United Way found a donor willing to fit Ameah for a pediatric wheelchair.\n\n\"Every little act of kindness goes a long way,\" Hagger said, her voice choked with emotion. \"We are very grateful.\"\n\nThe need is visually evident everywhere.\n\nIn Ironton, Trufant Salvant's house is one of only about eight in her neighborhood not swamped by Ida's floodwaters. After Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005, she was able to raise her home, which now sits 12 feet (3.6 meters) off the ground. She spoke to a visitor while sitting on a stool in a small area beneath the house that had been cleared of mud and debris.\n\nOther homes nearby had shifted or moved off their foundations entirely. One house landed in the middle of the street after floodwaters receded.\n\n\"This one hit us worse than Katrina,\" she said."}

With legacy pipeline assets becoming more connected and ransomware on the rise, attacks that shut down physical infrastructure are becoming more commonplace, they said.\n\n\"Now we're seeing five to 10 a year. While that might not seem high, this is one of them, and you have an entire coast shut down for a pipeline,\" said Nicholas Friedman, national managing partner and governance, risk and compliance strategist at enterprise risk management firm Templar Shield Inc.\n\nThe event is one of the highest-profile cyberattacks on U.S. energy infrastructure to date. It brought to a halt a major artery that provides the East Coast with nearly half of its fuel and prompted the federal government to convene inter-agency meetings and take emergency measures. The impact on fuel prices and supplies continues to be in flux.\n\nUncertainty around Colonial shutdown\n\nThe exact reason for the shutdown remains unclear. In public statements, Colonial has disclosed that it became aware on May 7 that it was the target of a cyberattack involving ransomware, which holds company data hostage. The company said it \"proactively took certain systems offline to contain the threat.\" That response stopped all pipeline operations and affected some of Colonial's information technology, or IT, systems, Colonial said.\n\nU.S. national security officials offered additional details during a May 10 White House press briefing. Colonial shut down the system in part to ensure the ransomware would not migrate from IT systems to operational networks, which control physical assets in the field, according to U.S. Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technologies Anne Neuberger. She said she could not disclose whether Colonial detected malware in its operational technology, or OT.\n\nCybersecurity solutions firm Tripwire Inc. said the Colonial incident appears to be limited to IT functions, but warned that cybercriminals are increasingly targeting industrial companies and utilities because they often have limited visibility into OT devices on their industrial network. \"Here we saw the direct impact of an IT event on OT systems, which reinforces the importance of maintaining visibility of assets across your entire network,\" Tripwire Vice President for Industrial Sales Alex Bagwell said in a May 11 blog post.\n\nVisibility entails creating a picture of the relationship between physical and digital worlds that allows companies to immediately identify which assets are associated with an anomaly once it is detected, according to Leo Simonovich, vice president and global head of industrial cyber and digital security at Siemens Energy AG.\n\nThat could in turn allow a more precise response to attacks, he added. Simonovich noted that the Colonial cyberattack has one thing in common with a previous attack that shut a gas pipeline system: Both companies took the blunt approach of shuttering a whole system."}

Twitch took Trump's suspension one step further Wednesday by removing his account from the platform entirely, ensuring he can't appeal the ban or create another account.

A record number of unaccompanied children crossed into the US this spring, and the throngs of desperate minors present a heart-rending problem as well as a political one.\n\nBiden announced Harris' new assignment on March 24 ahead of an immigration meeting in the White House State Dining Room, telling reporters that he had asked the vice president \"because she's the most qualified person to do it, to lead our efforts with Mexico and the Northern Triangle, and the countries that can help, need help in stemming the movement of so many folks, stemming the migration to our southern border.\"\n\nAfter the announcement, Harris' aides appeared to \"panic,\" according to one of the officials, out of concern that her assignment was being mischaracterized and could be politically damaging if she were linked to the border, which at the time was facing a growing number of arrivals. But another White House official pushed back on the sentiment, saying the vice president's team wasn't panicked.\n\nOne of the officials said Harris appears eager for a portfolio that will allow her to achieve political victories, especially in foreign policy, an area where she is far less experienced than Biden. Instead, Republican critics and the media have portrayed her new immigration role as a border assignment, potentially opening her up to criticism for the handling of the seemingly intractable problem.\n\nHarris' performance is critical to her future political career, which could well include a run for president. It's also of special concern right now as she prepares to depart for a trip to Guatemala and Mexico next week as part of this project. It will be her first official foray into in-person, in-country talks about the troubles that push Central American migrants toward the US.\n\nHarris and her staff have made it clear that they want to focus narrowly on diplomatic efforts in Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, where they believe they are more likely to achieve tangible results in addressing the root causes of migration, like economic despair, said the officials.\n\nThe recent commitments Harris secured from 12 private companies and organizations to invest in the Northern Triangle are one example."}

Rittenhouse was initially represented by Wood and John Pierce.\n\nDuring an interview with CNN on Friday evening after Rittenhouse was acquitted, Richards warned that some individuals were attempting to use his client to advance their own agendas. He said he cautioned Rittenhouse about decisions he will have to make going forward.\n\nThe lawyer said he had concerns earlier in the trial about \"the Lin Woods, the John Pierces who were basically, you know, I think were trying to whore this kid out for money, for their own causes.\" He said they \"kept Rittenhouse in Illinois to fight an extradition,\" a battle they couldn't win. Richards pointed out that they were \"raising tons of money on him.\"\n\n\"You know, Lin Wood and I went head to head and you know, he'll probably sue me for it, but he's an idiot who let him talk to The Washington Post while he was under charges for murder,\" Richards said. \"I mean, come on.\"\n\nWood told Newsweek in a Saturday email that Richards \"is badly misinformed.\" He contended a fundraising campaign for Rittenhouse that he was involved with was carried out in compliance with all relevant laws. The lawyer said he was \"at a loss to understand\" why Richards criticized him, saying there was no \"factual basis\" for his remarks.\n\nWood and Pierce fundraised to get Rittenhouse out on bail and then later asked for the funds to be returned, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. Wood was previously attacked by staunchly pro-Trump GOP Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia over the issue.\n\n\"People donated money through Fightback Law (Lin Wood) to Kyle Rittenhouse's legal defense. Kyle fired Lin in Dec. People didn't donate to Lin Wood, so why would he want $2M back?\" Greene wrote in a post published to her Telegram channel in October. \"Only monsters hurt innocent people in their greatest time of need,\" she added.\n\nWood dismissed the criticism from the far-right Republican, claiming bizarrely that she was secretly \"a communist.\" Newsweek reached out to Wood for comment on Richards' criticism but did not immediately receive a response.\n\nA spokesperson for Pierce emailed a statement from the attorney to Newsweek late Saturday evening. The spokesperson said that Pierce had legally rejected any entitlement to the funds he helped raise for Rittenhouse's bail.\n\n\"Unfortunately, manufactured controversy, such as the social media speculation about the bail money is nothing more than a distraction designed to discredit me, as I prepare to defend many more people who are being abused for political gain,\" Pierce said."}

And as Corey [Chirafisi] and I told him yesterday while we were waiting for the verdict, he needs to learn how to take responsibility and to tell people no.\"\n\nAfter the Carlson interview aired, Rittenhouse kept himself in the public eye, traveling to Florida to visit former President Donald Trump, posing for pictures.\n\n\"Under the law, he's considered innocent, he hasn't been convicted of anything so he's free to do whatever he wants to do,\" said Julius Kim, a legal expert.\n\nKim says just because Rittenhouse can do what he wants, doesn't mean his actions won't' hurt him. Especially if any civil cases are filed against him.\n\n\"It's never good to have a witness or client go out and make more statements than they need to because ultimately those statements can be turned around and used against them because you never know where litigation might lead to down the road,\" Kim said. \"So I personally don't think it's a great idea for him to continue doing interviews and seen out there but those are some of the dangers that are you have when you're involved in a high profile case that Mr. Richards was hinting at.\"\n\nLegal experts say if Rittenhouse profits off his notoriety from the case, it increases the likelihood he will be the target of lawsuits from those impacted by the night of August 25, 2020."}

The legal team is being led by John P. Coale, a trial attorney involved in lawsuits against big tobacco companies.\n\n\"We're going to hold big tech very accountable,\" Trump said during the press conference at his Trump National Golf Club Bedminster in New Jersey. \"If they can do it to me, they can do it to anyone.\"\n\nTwitter permanently banned Trump in January for his role in stoking the mob that attacked the U.S. Capitol Jan. 6 in a deadly riot to stop the counting of Electoral College votes for President Joe Biden. Facebook last month said Trump would remain suspended from its networks for at least two years, with the possibility of being reinstated in 2023 if risk to public safety has subsided.\n\nYouTube, Google's giant video service, also froze Trump's account following the Jan. 6 riot. The former president's videos are still accessible, but he isn't permitted to post new videos. Susan Wojcicki, YouTube's chief executive, has said that the company will reverse its policy when it decides that the \"risk of violence has decreased,\" without providing details.\n\nFacebook, Google and Twitter declined to comment on the suits, which were criticized by tech-funded advocacy groups. NetChoice, whose members include Amazon and other tech companies, said the action shows a \"deliberate misunderstanding of the First Amendment\" and is without merit.\n\n\"President Trump has no case,\" NetChoice CEO Steve DelBianco said in a release. \"The First Amendment is designed to protect the media from the President, not the other way around.\"\n\nTrump is seeking to overturn a federal law that shields internet companies from liability for content posted by users. Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act protects social media platforms from lawsuits accusing them of unfairly removing posts or accounts, among other legal challenges. The First Amendment prohibits the government from forcing tech companies to leave up or take down certain categories of posts.\n\nIn the lawsuits, Trump argues the liability protections under Section 230 means social media companies should be considered government actors that can be sued.\n\nThe banishment of Trump by major tech platforms reignited Republican calls to revoke the legal shield, arguing that it has enabled social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter to censor conservative viewpoints.\n\nThe lawsuits aren't the first time Trump has taken aim at Section 230. While in office, he tried to get Congress to repeal Section 230 by threatening to veto a Defense Department spending bill. Democrats have also proposed bills to curtail the legal shield to encourage tech companies to more aggressively rid their platforms of bigotry, abuse, and harassment.\n\nTech companies have largely resisted changes to the law, fearing that the proliferation of lawsuits will force them to clamp down on the free-flowing user-generated content. However, both Zuckerberg and Dorsey have expressed openness in recent months to Section 230 reforms.\n\nWithout access to the broad reach afforded by social media giants, Trump has struggled to maintain an online presence. He shut down his blog-like \"From the Desk of Donald J. Trump,\" though he frequently sends out several press statements a day — often targeting fellow Republicans he believes are insufficiently loyal.\n\nTrump recently stepped up his public activity by restarting rallies and making a trip to the southern U.S. border last week to criticize Biden's immigration policies. He's backing candidates in the 2022 midterm elections and actively opposing others. He has also held out the prospect of running again for president in 2024.\n\nThe former president has been teasing that he'll launch a new platform that can't remove him. He said on Dave Rubin's \"Rubin Report\" podcast on June 25 that \"there's a lot of platforms out there, that's what we're looking at, getting the right platform, a perfect platform, and I think you'll see something fairly soon.\"\n\nDuring his presidency, Trump used Twitter for everything from insulting rivals to major policy announcements, and he relied on Facebook especially to raise money from small-dollar donors.\n\nA Florida law prohibiting social media platforms from suspending the accounts of political candidates was blocked by a federal judge earlier this month. Likening the state's law to \"burning the house to roast a pig,\" U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle in Tallahassee said the legislation passed by a Republican legislature and a priority of Governor Ron DeSantis, violates the companies' free speech rights.\n\nThe case is Trump et al v Twitter Inc et al, 21-cv-22441, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida (Miami)."}

But Saturday, marchers took to Milwaukee city streets to protest what they call an injustice against white allies in the struggle against police brutality.\n\nMore than 100 marchers gathered at Red Arrow Park to voice their outrage over the not guilty verdict of Kyle Rittenhouse, the Illinois teen who killed two people and wounded a third during protests in Kenosha that turned violent following the police shooting of Jacob Blake in August 2020. The shooting left Blake partially paralyzed.\n\nA jury on Friday found Rittenhouse not guilty of first-degree reckless homicide for killing Joseph Rosenbaum, 36; first-degree intentional homicide for killing Anthony Huber, 26; and attempted first-degree intentional homicide in the shooting of Gaige Grosskreutz, 28. He was also found not guilty of two first-degree recklessly endangering safety counts.\n\n\"Anthony and Jojo, they didn't get justice yesterday,\" said Mariah Smith, of the Peoples Revolution, referring to Rosenbaum's nickname.\n\nBlack people, Smith, 29, said, have long heard the refrain that their lives don't matter, but the Rittenhouse verdict signals that refrain applies to whites who stand in the struggle for Black liberation.\n\n\"They've been saying Black lives don't matter but understand that if you stand with Black folks yours don't either,\" Smith said. \"Understand in the world there is a public enemy number one and it is Black folks and if you stand with the public enemy you are public enemy as well.

The marchers made their way along State Street before ending at the Federal Courthouse, 517 E.

A detailed written recovery plan can serve as a roadmap that enables your organization to return to normal as fast as possible. It should include the following major provisions:\n\nGoals and objectives that must be met in order to fully recover from the crisis\n\nThe specific tasks that have to be performed, and who will be responsible for them\n\nA timeframe for recovery\n\nThe money, expertise, and other resources that will be needed\n\nA list of those who should be notified or consulted about the progress in recovering from the crisis\n\nThe lessons learned from this crisis, and and how those lessons will be applied to the operations and policies of the organization to ensure the crisis is not repeated\n\nJust as companies should test their crisis and contingency plans to ensure they work when needed, businesses should hold table top, simulations, and other exercises to stress-test their recovery plans ahead of time and on a regular basis.\n\nDamage Already Done\n\nIt does not take long for a crisis to have a negative impact on companies and organizations.\n\nPeter Deans is a risk and strategy consultant and founder of 52 Risks. He observed that, \"For many companies, the damage [from the Suez Canal crisis] has already been done, with costly delays arising from delays in receiving supply inputs or finished goods, either directly or indirectly via their suppliers.\n\n\"These delays will have resulted in lost sales and/or additional supply costs and freight charges. It will be important to reach out to those customers that will be impacted in the coming months.\" He predicted that, \"...supply chains will take at least several weeks if not months to return to normal.\"\n\nDeep Understanding Needed\n\nDeans noted, \"These type of events highlight the need for companies [to] have a deep understanding of their supply chains, understand 'what can go wrong' and have contingency plans for these scenarios. This includes having the financial resources to see through these incidents. Scenario planning workshops can be helpful in thinking about the specific events that can impact a business' operations.\n\n\"As the Covid-19 pandemic has shown, it is critically important to have sufficient supplies of production inputs... to withstand any extended, external shocks and business disruptions,\" he counseled.\n\nLimited Options\n\nDepending on the nature of a crisis, there may not be too many alternatives on how to bounce back. In the aftermath of the Suez Canal crisis, the options may be very limited.\n\nMark Dohnalek is the president and CEO of Pivot International, a global manufacturing, engineering, technology, product development company. \"For companies to recover as quickly as possible from the backlog of ships in the Suez, they will have no choice but to seek sourcing that uses transit routes outside of this area — either domestic or Asian,\" he said."}

A sheriff's spokesman said the incident was resolved without action when he voluntarily put away his rifle.\n\nKline, who had attended the protests a day earlier with a dog, returned to the courthouse without a rifle, though he kept a sound system that blasted \"Build a B----\" by Bella Poarch and \"Ride It\" by DJ Regard, among other TikTok hits.\n\nHe returned to the courthouse Thursday with his dog, carrying a bullhorn and a long, narrow tote bag that was similar in appearance to a rifle case.\n\n\"I don't talk to the media,\" he shouted, pacing back and forth with the animal while playing rap music."}

Mitchell, who is Black, said the jury room was a relief after three weeks of emotional testimony that he described as \"like a funeral\" day after day.\n\n\"It's not human nature to watch people die,\" Mitchell said in an interview with The Associated Press, describing testimony that day after day included video of Floyd's desperate cries as he was held down by Chauvin. \"You know you want to be able to help somebody... watching the same person die every day, and you see his family member in the (courtroom).\"\n\nProsecutors said Chauvin pinned Floyd, a Black man, to the pavement outside Cup Foods in Minneapolis for 9 minutes, 29 seconds on May 25. Floyd had been accused of passing a counterfeit $20 bill at the store. Three other officers, since fired, face trial in August.\n\nProsecutors played a wide range of videos for the jury, including teenager Darnella Frazier's bystander video that was seen worldwide in the hours after Floyd's death. That video and the officers' body camera video recorded bystanders shouting at Chauvin and the other officers to get off Floyd, warning that they were cutting off his breathing and asking them to check for a pulse.\n\n\"It's cold in the room. It just feels dark,\" Mitchell said of the weeks of testimony. \"It felt like a funeral in there... The decision was the easy part.\""}

The FTC first sued Facebook in December 2020 over its allegedly anticompetitive practices, along with 48 state attorneys general who filed their own separate lawsuit. Both lawsuits were struck down in federal court in June, and while the states' lawsuit was struck down in its entirety—the judge ruled it had been brought too late—the FTC's lawsuit was dismissed \"without prejudice,\" clearing the way for the federal government to file it again. U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg dismissed the FTC's case because he said their arguments for why Facebook is a monopoly were \"light on specific factual allegations,\" writing the lawsuit was \"legally insufficient and must therefore be dismissed\" even as the judge acknowledged he \"does not agree with all of Facebook's contentions here.\" The FTC said in a statement it believes the 80-page amended complaint adequately addresses those issues, adding \"additional data and evidence\" and \"detailed statistics\" about Facebook's allegedly monopolistic behavior. Facebook said in a statement Thursday it's \"unfortunate...the FTC has chosen to continue this meritless lawsuit,\" arguing there was \"no valid claim\" to say \"Facebook was a monopolist\" when the case was first dismissed \"and that has not changed.\"\n\nCrucial Quote\n\n\"Facebook's course of conduct has eliminated nascent rivals and extinguished the possibility that such rivals' independent existence might allow other internet platforms to overcome the substantial barriers to entry that protect Facebook's monopoly position,\" the complaint states. \"In doing so, Facebook deprives personal social networking users in the United States of the benefits of competition, including increased choice, quality, and innovation.\"\n\nChief Critic\n\n\"The FTC's claims are an effort to rewrite antitrust laws and upend settled expectations of merger review, declaring to the business community that no sale is ever final,\" Facebook said in a statement Thursday. \"We fight to win people's time and attention every day, and we will continue vigorously defending our company.\"\n\nTangent\n\nFacebook has sought to have new FTC chair Lina Khan recused from the agency's antitrust lawsuit based on her past history of criticizing Facebook and alleging it practices anticompetitive behavior. The Wall Street Journal reports the FTC has rebuffed their request and Khan has not recused herself from the lawsuit, noting the agency voted to refile the lawsuit in a 3-2 vote with Khan \"participating in the deliberations and supporting the new complaint.\"\n\nWhat To Watch For\n\nThe FTC lawsuit could result in major consequences for Facebook should the court ultimately rule in the government's favor. The agency asks the court to declare Facebook in violation of federal law and take action to \"restore the competition that would exist\" if Facebook hadn't undertaken allegedly anticompetitive practices. This could be by breaking up Facebook, as the lawsuit calls for the \"divestiture or reconstruction of businesses\" like Instagram and WhatsApp that would make them separate entities.\n\nKey Background"}

A Kaiser Family Foundation poll in late February found that 44% of U.S. adults are still on the fence or unlikely to be vaccinated: 22% said they wanted to wait and see how the vaccines are working, 7% would get a vaccine only if it was required of them, and 15% said they definitely would not get vaccinated.\n\nThat could translate into a protracted recovery for the country, as most experts estimate that 80% to 85% of the population needs to have some level of immunity for the pandemic to end.\n\nVaccine hesitancy has many causes, not least among them distrust of the medical establishment — particularly among Black and Latinx communities — and concern about the rapid development of the vaccines.\n\nIn recent weeks, though, mixed messaging about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines — whether they work, whether they protect against the new coronavirus variants, whether we can ever stop masking and social distancing — has many experts concerned that even more people will opt out.\n\n\"I'm concerned that there are some broad statements about the vaccines that are informing the dialogue that aren't true that are making people really worried,\" says Monica Gandhi, MD, MPH, professor of medicine and associate division chief of the Division of HIV, Infectious Diseases, and Global Medicine at the University of California San Francisco at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center.\n\nWe spoke with Gandhi and several other prominent academic experts about some common myths — and facts — about the vaccines.\n\nMyth #1: The vaccines are dangerous."}

The candidate showed 100% protection against moderate and severe disease. In people at high risk of developing complications from COVID-19 (people 65 years or older and people under age 65 with certain comorbidities or with likely regular exposure to COVID-19), the vaccine showed 91.0% efficacy in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 disease.\n\nSafety data indicate the investigational vaccine was generally well-tolerated.

One business decided not to give in to their attackers' demands.\n\nCyberattacks like the recent global attack that impacted multiple companies over the Fourth of July weekend, this spring's disruptive attack on Colonial Pipeline and 2017's infamous WannaCry virus are only growing in frequency and cost. The last five years especially has shown a marked increase, with attackers holding information and digital architecture hostage while demanding greater and greater ransoms.\n\nIn 2021, major critical infrastructure systems have become a favorite target of hacker organizations. The early May attack on Colonial Pipeline, a major oil provider on the East Coast, not only showed how brittle corporate cybersecurity standards can be, but also that integral businesses can potentially be extorted into paying ransoms. Colonial Pipeline paid the attackers $4.4 million (with much of it recovered by the U.S. government) and the incident led to widespread gas shortages.\n\nBut if a company can be hacked once, it stands to reason that they can be hacked again.\n\nWhen Norsk Hydro, a Norwegian renewable energy and aluminum manufacturing company, recently faced a ransomware attack, they handled it in a different way. They refused to pay the ransom, and took up the task of removing the virus from the equation altogether.\n\nIn March of 2019, on the day Hilde Merete Aasheim was appointed Norsk Hydro CEO, she faced a predictable day full of meetings and media interviews. The last thing she expected was a wake up call at 4 a.m. Exhausted, she answered the phone and heard what she assumed was a practical joke on the other end.\n\n\"That's normally not when you get a phone call,\" says Aasheim, who was quickly informed that day of the attack. She said her colleague on the other end of the line told her: \"We are under a severe cyber attack, you have to come to work. This is not a drill.\"\n\nThe attack against Norsk Hydro (which produces enough energy in Norway for 900,000 homes per year) affected the company's global network of over 3,000 servers and thousands more PCs, locking everyone out and encrypting key areas of the company's IT network.\n\nWithout the decryption key, (which the hackers may or may not provide after a ransomware payment) that data is virtually inaccessible. But even regaining access left Norsk Hydro with a compromised system, one receptive to another attack. The company decided it would not pay the ransom, instead opting to reach out to cybersecurity experts. \"There was never the option to pay any ransom,\" says Aasheim, who suspected the attackers would only come back for more.\n\nMeanwhile the attack's virus crippled the company's network and stalled production in all of its manufacturing facilities. Norsk Hydro made the decision to shut down access to the network, and switch over to manual operation of its most critical systems, warning employees to stay off their devices. Next came shutting down the company's own internal network to prevent propagation of the virus.\n\nWhile the benefit of a downed network means easier identification of a malicious virus (as suspicious activity is more prominent), the ramifications were costly. How do you run a manufacturing company without computers, even for more than a single day? They had to figure out how to handle it for weeks.\n\n\"It was a very special situation for many weeks before we sort of had our hands around it...and could start to identify what was really compromised,\" says Aasheim. Printed order forms, sticky notes on doors and black computer screens, hours of manual labor and extensive bookkeeping helped keep the most essential orders fulfilled. Norsk Hydro relied on pen and paper to track its manufacturing and finances for about three weeks until computer access could be restored, only partially, and for mission-critical work.\n\n\"We didn't have any orders, we didn't have anything in the computers,\" says Aasheim.

With less than two weeks until he's gone, Democrats want him out — now — and he has few defenders speaking up for him in his own Republican party.\n\n\"We must take action,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared on a private conference call with Democrats.\n\nAnd one prominent Republican, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, told the Anchorage Daily News that Trump simply \"needs to get out.\"\n\nThe final days of Trump's presidency are spinning toward a chaotic end as he holes up at the White House, abandoned by many aides, top Republicans and Cabinet members. After refusing to concede defeat in the November election, he has now promised a smooth transfer of power when Democratic President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in on Jan. 20. But even so, he says he will not attend the inauguration — the first such presidential snub since just after the Civil War.\n\nIn Congress, where many have watched and reeled as the president spent four years breaking norms and testing the nation's guardrails of democracy, Democrats are unwilling to take further chances with only a few days left in his term. The mayhem that erupted Wednesday at the Capitol stunned the world and threatened the traditional peaceful transfer of power.\n\nPelosi said she had spoken to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley \"to discuss available precautions for preventing an unstable president from initiating military hostilities or accessing the launch codes\" for nuclear war.

Her middle name, Diana, was chosen to honor her beloved late grandmother, The Princess of Wales.\"\n\nAny new life is to be celebrated, and I'm happy that Markle and her child are healthy — especially considering the high rates of maternal and infant mortality among Black women in America, regardless of class status. On a human level, I see this as a joyous occasion and I hope that Lili has a good life, surrounded by love and security.\n\nHowever, her name opens up a political discussion.\n\nFor me and many others, Meghan and Harry's decision to name their Black child after the head of the family that they say racially abused them is baffling. The Sussexes sat down with Oprah a few months ago and detailed their sadness at being stripped of security and hearing that their son, Archie, would not have a title. They spoke about a family member musing as to how \"dark\" Archie would be while Meghan was pregnant. Meghan also revealed that she struggled with suicidal ideation while confined to palace grounds, and suggested the royal family denied her the life-saving mental healthcare she so desperately needed.\n\nIn the shocking interview, Harry and his wife made it very clear — they left the Royal Family to save Meghan's life, protect themselves and their children from racism, and flee the tyranny of British tabloids.\n\nAt first glance, this may seem like it has nothing to do with Queen Elizabeth. In fact, Meghan and her husband were effusive about the Queen's support of them in the Oprah interview. But the Queen has a great deal of power when it comes to family affairs. For instance, several of Archie's relatives — including Zara Phillips, daughter of Princess Anne and Mark Phillips — do not have titles. But according to the family, this was a deliberate choice made by their parents. Meghan and Harry made it clear that they were not given a choice; they were merely informed."}

It also destroyed an old brick building downtown on South Rampart Street, just a few blocks from the French Quarter.\n\nThe building hadn't looked like much in recent years. It sat empty, marred by graffiti and surrounded by vacant lots.\n\nBut it played a key role in the city's history. In the early 1900s, it became a second home to Louis Armstrong – its tenants even helped launch his musical career – long before he became a jazz icon.\n\nBack then the building housed the Karnofsky Tailor Shop, run by a family of Jewish immigrants from eastern Europe. As a young boy Armstrong started hanging out with the Karnofskys' five sons and was given a job riding on the family's coal and junk wagon, blowing a \"tin horn\" to alert potential customers.\n\n\"It was Louis' first instrument,\" said musicologist John Baron in a 1999 interview.\n\nThe Karnofskys lived in an apartment above the shop and often invited young Louis over for meals.\n\n\"In Louis Armstrong's biography ... he recalls the Karnofsky family with great pleasure and says ... that he still has matzo in his kitchen because he loved to eat Jewish food at the Karnofskys,\" Baron said. \"The Karnofskys were a tremendous, warm influence in his life.\"\n\nWhen he was a little older the family loaned him money to buy his first cornet, a trumpet-like horn, on the condition that he work for them for another year, which he did, Baron said.\n\nYears later, one of Armstrong's boyhood friends, Morris Karnofsky, opened the city's first jazz record store nearby. It became a favorite spot for musicians, and Armstrong made frequent visits over the years.\n\nArmstrong went on to become a towering figure in jazz and popular music, appealing to Black and White audiences alike with his deep, resonant voice and virtuosic trumpet playing.

But coming just days apart, they laid bare a dangerous and long-running current in the fight for racial equality: The move by some white Americans to grab guns and take their own stand against perceptions of lawlessness, particularly by Black people.\n\nThe two cases, which ended with an acquittal for Rittenhouse last week and guilty verdicts for Arbery's killers on Wednesday, highlighted polarizing issues about gun and self-defense laws, and racial injustice.\n\nThey also forced the questions: Who or what is being protected? And from whom? Should peace of mind for white Americans come at the expense of the protection and safety of Black Americans?\n\n\"So much of this issue about protection and safety is about the safety and the protection of whites or white property,\" said Carol Anderson, historian and professor of African American studies at Emory University. \"There is a hubris of whiteness. The sense that it is on me to put Black lives back into their proper place.\"\n\nArbery, a Black man, was chased and shot to death by white men suspicious of an outsider in their predominantly white Georgia neighborhood. In Wisconsin, while both Rittenhouse and the three men he shot were white, the encounter was triggered by the 17-year-old's decision to travel from his Illinois home to Kenosha and arm himself with an AR-15 rifle, bent on protecting local businesses from Black Lives Matter protesters.\n\nThe unmistakable connection: The idea that white men who perceive a problem \"should grab a gun and wade into trouble and then claim self-defense,\" said Michael Waldman, president of the Brennan Center for Justice at the NYU School of Law.\n\n\"This is a product of a gun culture. It's also a product of laws ... that give white men with guns the ability to create chaos and sometimes get away with it,\" said Waldman, author of \"The Second Amendment: A Biography.\"\n\nThe two coinciding trials highlighted deep racial rifts within American society, particularly following last year's broad movement for racial justice that swept the country in the wake of George Floyd's murder.\n\nBoth also came at the end of a year that began with an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, in which an overwhelmingly white crowd of supporters of former President Donald Trump, enraged with the idea that the 2020 election was \"stolen\" from them, stormed the building in an effort to take ownership of the government.\n\nThe impetus for raiding the Capitol, Anderson said, was the unfounded claim that there was massive amounts of voter fraud in cities where there were sizable Black populations, \"the notion that Black folks voting is what stole the election.\"\n\n\"That's the thing about vigilantism, it's that something precious to me, for me, for my community, is being stolen and it's being stolen by the unworthy, by the undeserving,\" Anderson said.\n\nWhite vigilantism signifies \"the need to keep the Black population, particularly the Black male population, under surveillance and under control,\" said writer Darryl Pinckney. It has evolved over time, but there is a long history in the U.S. of people taking the law into their own hands — and of white Americans using that as a pretext to violently enforce racial boundaries."}

The spokesperson cited Twitter's platform manipulation and spam rules, which prohibit users from running fake accounts and using multiple accounts to \"artificially amplify or disrupt conversations,\" though the company did not point to a specific infraction. O'Keefe told Forbes in a statement he plans on suing Twitter for defamation next week, denying that he ever operated fake accounts.\n\nCrucial Quote\n\n\"This is false, this is defamatory, and they will pay,\" O'Keefe said in a statement, which was sent through a Project Veritas spokesperson and posted to his Telegram account. \"Section 230 may have protected them before, but it will not protect them from me.\"\n\nKey Background\n\nProject Veritas is known for carrying out hidden-camera stings on media outlets and left-wing groups, and it's often accused of posting deceptive videos and spreading out-of-context claims (the group has denied these allegations). Most recently, the group released a string of videos targeting CNN: It leaked audio from months' worth of CNN editorial meetings last year, and it posted videos of an apparent CNN staffer claiming the network deliberately tried to undermine former President Donald Trump and his allies.\n\nSurprising Fact\n\nProject Veritas was itself suspended from Twitter two months ago for violating the social network's private information policy. O'Keefe was also temporarily locked out of his account at the time, but he was later reinstated.\n\nWhat To Watch For\n\nIf O'Keefe follows through on suing Twitter, it won't be his first defamation suit. Project Veritas is currently suing the New York Times for calling one of its reports \"deceptive,\" and he threatened to sue CNN for similar reasons this week.

Indeed, over half of the 43 senators were either critical of Trump or expressed neither criticism nor support for him on the merits (e.g., Groups A, C & D below).

(It's likely, however, if the Indians had known where this was going they might have suggested the Pilgrims order out.)\n\nA little more than a week ago, on November 19th, 18-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse was found not guilty by a jury of eleven white people and one person of color, of all five charges including murder, stemming from a deadly street protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on August 25, 2020. The day before Jacob Blake, a black man, was shot four times in the back and three times on the side as he opened the driver's door to his girlfriend's SUV.\n\nAmazingly, Blake survived though he required numerous surgeries. But the white cop who fired the shots faced no charges. This led to angry protests in the streets that included considerable looting. TV coverage and social media apparently inspired Rittenhouse, then 17, to drive from Antioch, Illinois to Kenosha. Unfortunately, he was carrying his trusty assault rifle. (Despite being under age to have any gun, much less such the deadly the AR-15.)\n\nSo it was Rittenhouse killed two men and permanently paralyzed a third but claimed self defense. In what some labeled an Oscar worthy performance, in his trial testimony Rittenhouse broke down crying. It was rather odd, however, because there were no tears. (To be fair, he didn't have the benefit of tear-inducing glycerin that actors and actresses use.)\n\nKyle got an \"A\" for effort as he squeezed his face and squinted his eyes over and over hoping to open the flood gates but it only released a tiny drop. At one point he sneaked a peek at the jury to see if they were buying it.\n\n(Spoiler alert: They were!)\n\nYes, \"Kryin' Kyle\" got off scot free and is the darling of the right wing gun rights activists. Ted Nugent, the over the hill rocker, reportedly has offered to provide Rittenhouse a lifetime's worth of ammunition. (What could go wrong there?)\n\nThe history of unarmed black men being killed by white men goes back to slavery that began in this country in 1619 when 20 enslaved Africans arrived in Jamestown. But in the public eye where an unarmed black man is killed by someone who claims self defense, that may have started with George Zimmerman.\n\nOn February 26, 2012, in Sanford, Florida, George Zimmerman fatally shot Travon Martin and was also found not guilty. I could list dozens, maybe hundreds of similar cases but I'm only allowed 800 words.\n\nSuch is the current case in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year old black man who went jogging and tragically he wound up dead. The three white men who were charged with his murder claimed self defense. Thankfully, they were all found guilty."}

Anti-Taliban fighters claimed to have seized three mountainous districts, and a prominent militia commander in the only province not yet under Taliban control pledged to fight back if attacked.\n\nThe British military on Sunday acknowledged at least seven deaths at the airport. Others may have been trampled, suffocated or suffered heart attacks as Taliban fighters fired into the air to try to drive back the crowds. Soldiers covered several corpses in white clothing. Other troops stood on concrete barriers, trying to calm the crowd.\n\nKabul's airport, now one of the only routes out of the country, has seen days of chaos since the Taliban entered the capital on Aug. 15. Thousands poured onto the tarmac last week, and several Afghans plunged to their deaths after clinging to a U.S. military cargo plane as it took off, some of the seven killed on Aug. 16.\n\nThe Taliban have pledged amnesty to those who worked with the U.S., NATO and the toppled Afghan government, but many Afghans still fear revenge attacks. There have been reports in recent days of the Taliban hunting down their former enemies. It's unclear if Taliban leaders are saying one thing and doing another, or if fighters are taking matters into their own hands.\n\nOutside the airport on Saturday, Western troops in full combat gear tried to control crowds big enough to be seen in satellite photos. They carried away some who were sweating and pale. With temperatures reaching 34 degrees Celsius (93 F), the soldiers sprayed water from a hose on those gathered and gave out bottled water.\n\n\"The situation at Kabul airport remains extremely challenging and unpredictable,\" a NATO official said on condition of anonymity in keeping with regulations. The official was not able to confirm a precise number of casualties.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy, which has relocated to the military side of the airport, has told American citizens and others not to come to the airport until they receive precise instructions.\n\nU.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN that 3,900 people had been airlifted out of Kabul on U.S. military flights in the past 24 hours, up from 1,600 the previous day. That's in addition to about 3,900 people airlifted on non-U.S. military flights over the past 24 hours. It remains far below the 5,000 to 9,000 that the military says it has the capacity to airlift daily.\n\nBritain said it had airlifted more than 5,000 people, including 1,000 in the last 14 hours.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin activated the Civil Reserve Air Fleet program, requesting 18 aircraft from U.S. carriers to assist in transporting Afghan refugees after they are evacuated to other countries. The voluntary program, born in the wake of the Berlin airlift, adds to the military's capabilities during crises.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has vowed to bring home all Americans from Afghanistan and to evacuate Afghans who aided the U.S. war effort. U.S. military helicopters have been used to collect 169 Americans from outside the airport. Tens of thousands of Americans and others are still hoping to fly out.\n\nThere also have been concerns about a potential attack on the airport by a local Islamic State affiliate. U.S. military planes have been executing corkscrew landings, and other aircraft have fired flares upon takeoff, measures used to prevent missile attacks.\n\nThe Taliban blame the chaotic evacuation on the U.S. military, saying there's no need for Afghans to fear them, even though their fighters shoot into the air and beat people with batons as they try to control the crowds outside the airport.\n\n\"All Afghanistan is secure, but the airport, which is managed by the Americans, has anarchy,\" Amir Khan Motaqi, a senior Taliban official, said Sunday. The U.S. \"should not embarrass itself to the world and should not give this mentality to our people that (the Taliban) are a kind of enemy.\""}

Jerry Nadler, D-New York, called the outcome \"heartbreaking.\"\n\n\"Justice cannot tolerate armed persons crossing state lines looking for trouble while people engage in First Amendment-protected protest,\" he wrote.\n\nPart of that statement -- the claim Rittenhouse was armed when he crossed state lines -- was repeated by many in the wake of the verdict.\n\nBut that information is wrong.\n\nTweet vs. reality\n\nWhen asked for backup, Nadler spokesperson Dan Rubin said the tweet was trying to make the point that Rittenhouse could be open to further review by the U.S. Department of Justice because he crossed state lines to be in Wisconsin for the protests.\n\nThe tweet, Rubin said, wasn't meant to convey that Rittenhouse had taken the gun itself over state lines, arguing that the situation \"at least opens up the possibility of a broader review from DOJ.\"\n\nBut that's not what the tweet says. It suggests Rittenhouse brought the gun to Wisconsin, when testimony said he did not.\n\n(To be sure, there was plenty of controversy around the fact he had a gun, and Rittenhouse initially faced a misdemeanor charge of unlawfully possessing the gun as a minor. Under Wisconsin law, anyone under 18 who possesses a dangerous weapon is guilty of a misdemeanor, unless they fall under an exception, such as for hunting. For months, Rittenhouse's attorneys pointed to one of those exceptions that they argued allows 16- and 17-year-olds to carry rifles and shotguns as long as they are not unlawfully short-barreled. Prosecutors acknowledged the gun was not short-barreled, after which the judge tossed the charge.)\n\nDuring the trial, Dominick Black, a close friend, testified that he agreed to purchase the gun for Rittenhouse, according to a Nov. 2, 2021 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel report.\n\nBlack used money Rittenhouse gave him to make the purchase in Wisconsin, knowing the purchase was illegal. Rittenhouse and Black agreed that Rittenhouse wouldn't get the gun himself until he turned 18.\n\nRittenhouse did shoot the weapon several times the weekend it was purchased while up north at Black's family hunting property in May 2020, the Journal Sentinel report said.\n\nBlack testified that normally, the AR-15 was stored in Black's home in Kenosha, locked up in a gun safe. The safe could only be opened by Black's stepfather. But the night of the unrest, the guns were taken out of the safe and into the basement.\n\nSome time after Rittenhouse arrived in Kenosha on Aug. 25, 2020, he retrieved the gun from Black's basement and went into the downtown area.\n\n(A final note: Now that Rittenhouse has been acquitted, Black is asking that charges against him related to buying the gun be thrown out. A decision on that has been delayed.)\n\nOur ruling\n\nLike many others, Nadler said in a tweet following Rittenhouse's acquittal that the teen had traveled across state lines with a firearm."}

Gavin Newsom is proposing to use federal relief money and California's record-setting tax revenue from the wealthy to send $600 stimulus checks to four out of five tax filers, pay down back rent for tenants and help millions catch up on utility bills.\n\nAt the start of the pandemic a year ago, today's news would have seemed unimaginable: The Golden State is sitting on a budget surplus so big, it's considering giving $600 stimulus checks to California households making up to $75,000, paying off back rent of tenants affected by COVID and helping millions of residents catch up on their water and electricity bills.\n\n\"California is not just back, California is roaring back,\" Gov. Gavin Newsom said today in announcing a whopping $75.7 billion surplus that's enabling him to propose what he claims is the largest state tax rebate in American history.\n\nFacing a line of Republican challengers in an upcoming recall, the first-term Democratic governor seized the opportunity to showcase California's budgetary good fortunes by kicking off a statewide tour ahead of a formal budget update Friday. Billed as a $100 billion California comeback plan, the Newsom administration is able to leverage $26 billion in federal relief funds as well as a windfall from California's richest residents who have seen their wealth soar during the pandemic, even as the virus has wreaked havoc on the lives and livelihoods of millions of low-wage Californians.\n\nCalifornia is not just back, California is roaring back. Gov. Gavin Newsom\n\nAt a press conference in the Oakland neighborhood of Fruitvale, Newsom announced an $11.9 billion expansion of his Golden State Stimulus program to send one-time $600 payments to Californians, $5.2 billion to help low-income renters stay housed, $2 billion to help Californians pay overdue water and utility bills, and $1 billion in college grants to help workers whose jobs have been decimated by the pandemic find better-paying work.\n\nThe rest of the relief proposal will address \"five of the state's most stubborn challenges,\" according to his office. Lawmakers have until June 15 to negotiate a finalized budget.\n\n\"I'm just very proud that we are a state that reflects the type of values that recognizes that so many people were disproportionately hurt by this pandemic,\" said Senator Nancy Skinner, an Oakland Democrat who leads the Senate budget committee.\n\nHer counterpart in the Assembly, San Francisco Democrat Phil Ting, piled on: \"This is an opportunity to build the California, not of next year, but really, of the next 100 years.\"\n\nGood timing\n\nFor Newsom, who is facing an all-but-certain recall election later this year, it's a politically fortuitous time to have tens of billions of dollars worth of goodies to sprinkle around the state. That's particularly true of the stimulus payments, which, if enacted by the Legislature, would likely wind up in taxpayers' mailboxes in the fall — around the same time as the recall ballots."}

As of Monday, May 10, the pipeline had not resumed operations of its main lines, although some smaller lines are operational. The company announced that it hopes to restore service by the end of the week.\n\nColonial Pipeline, a 2.5-million-barrel-per-day (b/d) system of approximately 5,500 miles of pipeline, is a significant mode of shipment for transportation fuels for the East Coast, particularly for several states in the southeastern United States. The pipeline carries refined petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel, heating oil, and jet fuel from Houston, Texas, on the U.S. Gulf Coast up to Linden, New Jersey, and serves several markets along the route through various branch lines. Because no refineries between Alabama and the mid-Atlantic produce substantial quantities of transportation fuels, the southeastern United States is supplied primarily by pipeline flows, and to a lesser degree, with marine shipments from the U.S. Gulf Coast and imports.\n\nUntil Colonial Pipeline resumes operation, petroleum distribution terminals in the Southeast will rely on inventories and on supplies obtained from alternative sources, such as the smaller 720,000 b/d Products (SE) Pipeline that also carries petroleum products from the U.S. Gulf Coast to as far as Washington, DC.\n\nPipeline shipments move at approximately five miles per hour, so some markets may need to rely on inventories for several days after Colonial Pipeline service is restored. Markets along the Atlantic Coast with access to deepwater ports, such as Savannah, Georgia; Charleston, South Carolina; Wilmington, North Carolina; and Norfolk, Virginia, can receive limited imports from the global market and from marine shipments via coastwise compliant shipping originating from the U.S. Gulf Coast.

Shortly afterwards, he tweeted out a similar message in text. \"These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long,\" the President tweeted on Wednesday afternoon. \"Go home with love & in peace. Remember this day forever!\"\n\nAt first, Twitter reacted by locking down both messages, so that they could not be liked, retweeted or replied to, before ultimately suspending the account for 12 hours. On Friday, after the suspension was lifted, Trump only tweeted twice. The first was to praise those who voted for him, saying that they \"will have a GIANT VOICE long into the future. They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!\" His last tweet, at least from this suspended account, was an announcement that he would not attend Biden's inauguration.\n\nFrom the cryptic \"Covfefe\" to caps-lock declarations of \"WITCH HUNT,\" in many ways Twitter has defined his presidency. To his more than 88 million followers, he wielded it like a policy wishlist, a cudgel to publicly scorn his enemies or fire members of his Administration and his preferred way to offer political endorsements.\n\nEspecially over the past year, both Trump's usage of Twitter and his criticism of the company has increased. During 2020 and in the run up to the election, he would tweet and retweet sometimes 200 tweets a day. In May 2020, Trump tweeted a baseless allegation that the use of mail in ballots in elections would be \"substantially fraudulent\" and, for the first time, Twitter flagged it as an \"unsubstantiated claim.\" As the President continued to spread misinformation about elections and the COVID-19 pandemic, Twitter continued to crack down on his tweets, with escalated warnings.\n\nTrump and other prominent Republicans said they viewed Twitter's moves as censorship, and have called for the repeal of Section 230, part of an Internet legislative act passed in 1996 which would change the rules by which litigation could be brought against social media companies. Trump's own interest in repealing this sliver of the law was so great that last month he vetoed a bi-partisan defense spending bill for not including language that would defend him against his perceived censorship.

He was 59 years old.\n\nHe had kept his stage 4 prostate cancer private until after the broadcast of Friends: The Reunion in June 2021, which he appeared on via Zoom.\n\nTyler said on the Today show: \"I wanted to be a part of that, and initially I was going to be on the stage, at least, with them, and be able to take part in all the festivities. It was bittersweet, honestly. I was very happy to be included.\n\n\"It was my decision not to be a part of that physically and make an appearance on Zoom, basically, because I didn't wanna bring a downer on it, you know? I didn't want to be like, 'Oh, and by the way, Gunther has cancer.'\"\n\nAt this time, the cancer metastasized to his spine, leading him to use a wheelchair.\n\nTyler's Friends castmates were among those paying tribute following the news.\n\nJennifer Aniston, whose character Rachel was the object of Gunther's affections, wrote on Instagram: \"Friends would not have been the same without you. Thank you for the laughter you brought to the show and to all of our lives. You will be so missed.\"\n\nTyler also appeared in shows including Sabrina The Teenage Witch, Episodes and Scrubs, and the thriller Motel Blue.\n\nColin Powell\n\nColin Powell died aged 84 on October 18 at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center following complications from COVID-19.\n\nHe had been vaccinated, but his multiple myeloma had compromised his immune system, while he also had early-stage Parkinson's disease.\n\nPowell was the first Black U.S. secretary of state, and had shaped foreign policy in leadership roles in a number of Republican administrations.\n\nFollowing a career in the military, he became first Black national security adviser during the end of Ronald Reagan's presidency and the youngest and first African American chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under President George H.W. Bush.\n\nHowever, despite his popularity soaring following the Gulf War, his reputation was tainted when he pushed faulty intelligence before the United Nations to advocate for the Iraq War, while serving as George W. Bush's first secretary of state.\n\nFollowing Powell's death, Bush said he was \"a great public servant\" who was \"such a favourite of Presidents that he earned the Presidential Medal of Freedom - twice. He was highly respected at home and abroad. And most important, Colin was a family man and a friend.\"\n\nHalyna Hutchins\n\nCinematographer Halyna Hutchins died aged 42 on October 21, when she was fatally wounded on the set of the Western movie Rust in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\n\nHutchins was working as director of photography on the film and was setting up a scene when a prop gun was discharged by Alec Baldwin, shooting her in the mid-section.\n\nShe was taken by helicopter to the University of New Mexico Hospital, but died from her injuries.\n\nIt later emerged that the prop revolver, which Baldwin was told was \"cold\" (did not contain ammunition), contained a live round.\n\nThe investigation into the incident is ongoing.\n\nBorn in Ukraine, Hutchins was a rising star in the world of cinematography and had worked on the movies Archenemy, starring Joe Manganiello, Darlin' and Blindfire.\n\nShe is survived by her husband Matthew and son Andros.\n\nEmani 22\n\nR&B singer Emani 22 died on October 11, at the age of 22.\n\nHer death was confirmed by her manager Fred Green, who said in a statement: \"It is with heavy hearts that the family of Emani has confirmed her passing. They would like to share that although she fought courageously and the medical team went above and beyond doing everything in their power to aid in her recovery, on Monday, October 11th, Emani succumbed to the injuries she sustained after a tragic accident.\n\n\"At this time, Emani's family is asking for privacy to mourn and honor her life and memories.\"\n\nHer cause of death was not immediately released.\n\nEmani 22, real name Emani Johnson, had released her first album The Color Red last year, containing the singles \"Feelings\" and \"Better Days.\"\n\nRonnie Tutt\n\nRonnie Tutt, drums, performs with the Elvis Presley band at the Paradiso on January 8th 2004 in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

The few still open had lines of more than a dozen cars and a wait time of nearly an hour.\n\nLouisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said on Saturday that Ida \"is a dangerous storm, and our window to prepare is rapidly closing\".\n\n\"We have a very serious situation on our hands,\" Edwards said during a briefing. \"This will be one of the strongest hurricanes to hit anywhere in the state of Louisiana since at least the 1850s.\"\n\nMike Laurent of Marrero, Louisiana, was filling up about a dozen petrol canisters for his generator and those belonging to friends and family.

But whereas Katrina was a Category 3 when it made landfall southwest of New Orleans, Ida is expected to reach an extremely dangerous Category 4 hurricane.\n\nHurricane Ida \"is going to do more damage to industries than Katrina did\" because the storm's projected track has it hitting a vital industrial corridor between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, said meteorologist Jeff Masters.\n\nHe said Ida is forecast to move through \"the just absolute worst place for a hurricane\"."}

Many, many fireworks.\n\nThat display, a stunning four minutes or so, was created by Strictly FX, a company founded in Chicago in 1996 that does most of its pyrotechnics business with touring rock shows and events like the Super Bowl. And it served as the finale to the \"Celebrating America\" prime-time television special devoted to President Joseph Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on Inauguration Day.\n\nThe internet exploded afterward, mostly congratulating Perry for her performance. The fireworks were credited mostly as backdrop. That's fine with Adam Biscow and FX; Biscow is the designer that created the show, the guy who put the white burst directly behind Perry's outstretched hand just as she hit her final chorus and elicited a breathless \"Oh yeah!\" from host Tom Hanks as he signed off the show.\n\nSpeaking with the Tribune from the Washington Mall on Thursday, he said shows like Wednesday's are a team effort. Strictly FX, which moved its headquarters to Nashville in 2018 but maintains an office in Mount Prospect as well as California, created the show, with the shells fired by Garden State Fireworks of New Jersey, which holds the contract to do fireworks in the city and is a frequent collaborator.\n\n\"We don't do shows like this for the credit,\" Biscow said. \"We do it for the love of what we do, it's little piece of history we got to take part in.\"\n\nStrictly FX also did the show for Biden's victory speech in Wilmington, Delaware, in November that got attention for its use of drones, and Biscow said the president-elect came in and thanked the crew personally afterward.\n\nIn this image from video, singer Katy Perry performs during the \"Celebrating America\" event on Wednesday, following the inauguration of Joe Biden as the 46th president of the United States. (AP)\n\nBiscow declined to give a dollar figure for the cost of Wednesday's show, but allowed that it used about 20,000 shells fired from two separate launch areas, one a chain of nine zones behind the monument itself, the other in West Potomac Park. The sky filled behind the Washington Monument was about 2,000 feet wide, choreographed to the song. At moments the sky was a riot of dripping silver — those streaming explosions are called brocade shells and are a favorite of his — and at others a wall of brilliant red, with the edges of the bursts just touching each other."}

And he made prosecutors provide addresses for about 27 witnesses that might actually be called, after they first submitted a witness list of 175 people.\n\nAt a hearing, which ran more than two hours, Schroeder said he would hold a separate pre-trial hearing next month about whether he'll allow testimony from use-of-force experts that both sides have indicated they want to call.\n\nThe trial itself remains set for Nov. 1.\n\nRittenhouse, now 18, is charged with fatally shooting two people and wounding a third — along with other lesser offenses — during violent protests in Kenosha on Aug. 25, 2020 after the police shooting of Jacob Blake. His lawyer says he acted in self defense.\n\nThe prosecution did reveal Friday that it has infrared video from an FBI airplane that they say shows Rittenhouse was chasing his first victim, Joseph Rosenbaum, and said something to him before Rosenbaum then chased him, leading to the fatal encounter seconds later. The defense said it is obtaining the same video soon.\n\nAlso left undecided Friday was whether the estimated 150 or so people who will be summoned as possible jurors will be asked to fill out extensive questionnaires before the selection process begins.\n\nSchroeder, Wisconsin's longest serving sitting judge, said he disfavors questionnaires, and expressed concern it would tip recipients off that they could serve in the high-profile Rittenhouse trial — and might prompt even more talk about the case than has already been occurring in town.\n\nHe said someone even approached him in a grocery store and said they'd love to serve on the Rittenhouse jury, adding: \"Of course, that person will not.\"\n\nSchroeder said he's concerned about some of the questions lawyers have proposed concerning issues like support for certain political movements, guns, or memberships.\n\n\"This is not and won't be a political trial,\" he said.\n\nBut both sides urged him to use a questionnaire, to speed jury selection and help screen out people with the most strongly held views before they \"contaminate\" other potential jurors during traditional voir dire, where people in a group answer questions from lawyers in person.\n\nSchroeder seemed confident a jury could be selected in one day, without a questionnaire ahead of time, but said he'd revisit the matter and decide next week whether one — with limited queries — could be sent out.\n\nJudge rejects evidence on 'prior acts'\n\nAssistant District Attorney Thomas Binger argued repeatedly that three incidents involving Rittenhouse go \"to what I posit strong theory of case — that he's essentially a teen vigilante involving himself in things that don't concern him.\"\n\nOne video shows Rittenhouse striking a girl who was fighting with his sister in June 2020. One from Aug. 15, 2020 shows him and a friend watching from inside a car as people — whom Rittenhouse believes are looters — leave a CVS store across the street, while Rittenhouse says he wished he had his rifle so he could shoot at them. The still photos are of Rittenhouse posing with members of the Proud Boys at a Racine County tavern after a hearing in his case in January.\n\nBinger said he expects the defense to portray Rittenhouse as a community-minded altruist, so jurors need to hear about his other state of mind. \"It helps illuminate the truth for the jury,\" he said."}

Brandon died at age 28 in a similar accident in March 1993 on the set of his film The Crow.\n\n\"I think that mandatory gun safety training [should be required] for the actor so that they can check the guns themselves and know how to use them appropriately, and so that they can keep others safe,\" Shannon, 52, told AFP, calling gun safety measures that are in place right now \"frustrating.\"\n\nShannon said she never spoke to the man who fired the fatal shot in her brother's case, Michael Massee, before he died in 2016, adding that she hopes Baldwin, 66, takes care of himself in the difficult aftermath.\n\n\"I felt really sorry because it is a horrible thing to cause someone else to die. And I also feel sorry for Alec Baldwin,\" she said. \"It's really tough what he's going through. He has to take care of himself.\"\n\nWhen news of the Rust incident broke, Shannon, the daughter of Bruce Lee, wrote on Twitter, \"Our hearts go out to the family of Halyna Hutchins and to Joel Souza and all involved in the incident on Rust.

Period.\"\n\nLast month, Brandon's fiancée Eliza Hutton came forward for the first time since he died, telling PEOPLE that the recent accident on the New Mexico set of Rust is yet another \"avoidable tragedy.\"\n\n\"Twenty-eight years ago, I was shattered by the shock and grief of losing the love of my life, Brandon Lee, so senselessly. My heart aches again now for Halyna Hutchins' husband and son, and for all those left in the wake of this avoidable tragedy,\" Hutton, 57, said.\n\n\"I urge those in positions to make change to consider alternatives to real guns on sets,\" she added.\n\nBaldwin has been in contact with Hutchins' husband, Matthew Hutchins, and 9-year-old son Andros since the tragedy, and had breakfast with them two days after the shooting. The former 30 Rock star told paparazzi last week that Hutchins was his \"friend,\" adding that he and wife Hilaria Baldwin have been \"very worried\" about Matthew and Andros.\n\nThe shooting happened on Oct. 21. During a rehearsal, assistant director David Halls unknowingly handed Alec a gun that had been loaded with real bullets. Thinking it was only loaded with blanks, Halls shouted \"cold gun\" to indicate it was safe to use, according to a Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office search warrant affidavit.\n\nNeither Halls nor Baldwin knew that the gun had live ammunition in it, according to the affidavit.\n\nThe investigation remains ongoing, with production on the film halted. No charges have been filed, though authorities have said that \"all options are on the table at this point\" and \"no one has been ruled out\" as they search for answers as to what led to the fatal shooting."}

The company required the removal of three of Trump's tweets, including a short video in which he urged those supporters to \"go home\" while also repeating falsehoods about the integrity of the presidential election. Trump's account deleted those posts, Twitter said; had they remained, Twitter had threatened to extend his suspension.\n\nThis means that the account of @realDonaldTrump will be locked for 12 hours following the removal of these Tweets.

To be fair, ironies like this one are impossible to escape in the United States circa 2021, where we love our kids, but love our guns more.\n\nBasic logistics suggest Arkansas blood is unlikely to make it into the veins of injured Michiganders. Still, the sentiment is nice. The need for blood usually goes up around the holidays, in Michigan and everywhere else. Plus, here's a great opportunity to pretend you're doing something about gun violence without actually doing anything about gun violence at all. Expect to see some NRA-endorsed Republican politicians there with sleeves rolled up. School shootings have become America's signature move, and no amount of junior-sized body bags seem to convince these NRA-owned lawmakers that maybe giving the gun lobby and gun manufacturers free rein isn't a healthy idea.\n\nThe school shooting in Michigan on Tuesday has a few unique traits. The gun used was a brand new one, a Black Friday purchase by the dad of the shooter. We don't yet know much about the gunman. But his name hasn't yet been released and he's reportedly on suicide watch in a juvenile detention facility, which means we can safely assume he's white. Black kids who shoot other kids tend to get publicly named and charged as adults right off the bat.\n\nGun violence rates, and school shooting rates especially, have been spiking up in recent years, as chest-thumping Trumpublicans arm themselves for civil war or whatever, and cunning lobbyists push through stand your ground laws to help white men get away with murder. This year is on pace to be the worst for gun violence in decades.\n\nThe vast majority of Americans, Republican and Democrat alike, oppose our insane menu of laws that put our children in the crosshairs by making guns available anytime, anywhere, for pretty much anyone. But the majority of lawmakers clearly think our laws are fine. And doing the unglamorous grassroots work of fighting the NRA's bought-and-paid-for operatives in Congress and state houses is a slog. An exhausting, heartbreaking slog.\n\nIt would be cool if voters would call their representatives today and ask for meaningful gun safety legislation, like universal background checks and safe storage requirements so 15-year-olds can't just pick up dad's new gun and pick off their classmates.\n\nOr you can just go give some blood from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday at the Bass Pro Shop parking lot if it makes you feel better."}

He suffered a lung injury when he got hit by Jets linebacker Mo Lewis during Week 2. Tom Brady, an unheralded sixth round pick in his second season, would never relinquish the starting job. The Patriots, who had begun the regular season 0-2, finished 11-5.\n\nHad Bledsoe not gotten hurt that season, it is not a stretch to say that the entirety of the last 20 years of NFL history would have been much different."}

But a worker at outsourcing mega-org Wipro accidentally checked the wrong combination of on-screen boxes, leading to the repayment of not only the interest but also the $894m (£640m) principal from the bank's funds.\n\nCitibank has a \"six-eyes\" policy on massive money transfers of this type. In the Revlon fiasco, a Wipro worker in India configured the transfer using software called Flexcube, his local manager approved it, and Vincent Fratta – a Citibank senior manager based in Delaware, USA – gave the final OK for the transfer of funds, all believing the settings were correct.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the transfer set up by the first Wipro worker. He should have ticked not just the principal field but also the front and fund fields, and set their values to the necessary clearing account number. By leaving those two boxes unchecked and values empty – and wrongly assuming just putting the account number in the principal field was a correct move – the entire principal of the loan, which was set to mature in 2023, was handed back to 315 creditors.\n\nIncomplete ... The Flexcube interface for the infamous transfer. Click to enlarge. Source: US courts system\n\nIt wasn't until the next day that staff noticed the error, and sent out emails asking for the funds be returned – and hundreds of millions of dollars were. However, a group of 10 creditors refused to hand back their share the cash, amounting to more than $500m, leading Citibank to sue them in New York to recover the dosh.\n\nThis week, the US federal district court judge presiding over that lawsuit sided with the lenders, saying [PDF] they had reasonable grounds to think that the transfer was legitimate and that they had legal grounds to keep their money.\n\n\"The non-returning lenders believed, and were justified in believing, that the payments were intentional,\" Judge Jesse Furman ruled.\n\n\"Indeed, to believe otherwise — to believe that Citibank, one of the most sophisticated financial institutions in the world, had made a mistake that had never happened before, to the tune of nearly $1bn — would have been borderline irrational.\"\n\nSince the amount sent back repaid the loaned amounts to the cent and no more, the judge ruled Citibank had no right to reclaim the money.\n\n\"We are extremely pleased with Judge Furman's thoughtful, thorough and detailed decision,\" Benjamin Finestone, representing two lenders, Brigade and HPS Investment Partners, told CNN."}

Didn't let the big bus through... They said they would beat us badly if we don't go. Aug. 25 8:38 a.m. AFT\n\nFor those who made it out on the airlift from Kabul, their fate was often determined by a combination of courage, split-second choices and chance.\n\nA convoy to the Kabul airport, hostile Taliban and the faint hope that the gates to escape would swing open\n\nA month before the Taliban seized Kabul, a letter appeared on the doorstep of Sara Qaderi's home in the city. The militants knew she was working for a U.S.-funded research program, the letter stated. It was only a matter of time before they killed her.\n\nQaderi immediately thought about leaving Afghanistan, but had no place to go.\n\nNow it was Aug. 15 and the government was collapsing. Taliban fighters were streaming into the capital. Qaderi, a 24-year-old agricultural scientist, raced out of her office and into traffic-choked streets; her normal 10-minute commute by car stretched to three panic-filled hours. When she finally reached the safety of her living room, her parents and siblings were already gathered there.\n\n\"We need to get out,\" Qaderi said.\n\nThe largest airlift evacuation of civilians in American history was about to begin. By the time it was finished, more than 120,000 people had been spirited to safety in a 17-day operation that President Biden deemed \"an extraordinary success.\"\n\nBut it was also a terrifying, bloody crisis that often overwhelmed the capacity of the U.S. military and diplomatic corps. Instead of an orderly exit, a mad rush for the airport left many behind and others dead in a suicide bombing that claimed the lives of 13 U.S. service members and more than 170 Afghans.\n\nIn a matter of days, thousands of families were divided, with no immediate prospect of reunion, and a continents-spanning diaspora was born. Lives, such as Qaderi's, were indelibly altered, their trajectories determined by a rough combination of courage, split-second choices and chance.\n\nAs the United States retreated, thousands of Afghans who had assisted its mission in ways large and small over the preceding 20 years were left feeling abandoned and betrayed. A motley collection of volunteer groups emerged to try to fill the void. Driven by a combination of duty, embarrassment and guilt, these veterans, aid workers and average citizens banded together to save as many people as they could before the U.S. military withdrew.\n\nThe groups relied on cellphones and ad hoc online networks to communicate directly with Afghans, foreign diplomats and frustrated military officials at the airport. Often, they were the Afghans' only hope for escape."}

The emotional ABC News Special with George Stephanopoulos breaks tomorrow at 8/7c on ABC and later that evening on Hulu.\n\n\"Someone put a live bullet in a gun, a bullet that wasn't even supposed to be on the property,\" Baldwin said in a clip of the upcoming interview.\n\nOn Oct. 21, Baldwin was holding an antique revolver during a dress rehearsal for \"Rust\" at the Bonanza Creek Ranch near Santa Fe, New Mexico, when the firearm discharged a live round, striking the film's cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins, in the chest. The bullet that hit Hutchins also struck the film's director, Joel Souza, in the shoulder, according to the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office.\n\nHutchins, 42, died after being airlifted to University of New Mexico Hospital in Albuquerque, the state's only Level 1 trauma center, in critical condition, according to the sheriff's office and the hospital. Souza, 48, was rushed via ambulance to Christus St. Vincent Regional Medical Center in Santa Fe where he was receiving emergency care, according to the sheriff's office. Actress Frances Fisher, who was cast in \"Rust,\" wrote on Twitter the next day that Souza was released from the hospital.\n\nNew details about the fatal movie set shooting involving Alec Baldwin could emerge after investigators searched a gun store.\n\nSanta Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said an initial investigation determined that two other people had handled or inspected the loaded gun before it discharged -- the film's armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, and the first assistant director, Halls.\n\nGutierrez-Reed was in charge of all weapons on set. Her attorney has stated that Gutierrez-Reed had no idea where the live rounds came from.\n\nAccording to an affidavit for a search warrant filed on Oct. 22 by the sheriff's office as part of the ongoing probe, Halls handed a Colt .45 revolver to Baldwin while proclaiming \"cold gun,\" to let the crew know a gun with no live rounds was being used. Halls told investigators he did not know there were any rounds in the firearm he gave to the actor, according to the affidavit.\n\nHalls' attorney would not confirm that he was the one who handed the gun to Baldwin, but she told ABC News that Halls was on set when the firearm discharged.\n\n\"Dave has told me since day one that it was an accident,\" Torraco said. \"It was a pure accident -- freak, awful accident [ that ] unfortunately killed somebody.\"\n\nThe Santa Fe district attorney who is leading the investigation into the \"Rust\" set shooting involving Alec Baldwin discredited sabotage theories.\n\nTorraco said Hall is \"heartbroken\" over the tragedy and ensuing scrutiny.\n\n\"It's very, very painful and very hard for him,\" she added.\n\nNo charges have been filed in the case.

That was my brother!\"\n\nThe raw and emotional scene was described by Mark Schmitz, father of 20-year-old Jared Schmitz, in The Washington Post. Mr Schmitz said he grew agitated as Mr Biden appeared to check his watch and responded bluntly when asked to remember the men and women killed in Kabul.\n\n\"I said, 'Don't you ever forget that name. Don't you ever forget that face. Don't you ever forget the names of the other 12... and take some time to learn their stories',\" Mr Schmitz told the president.\n\nMr Biden responded curtly and didn't like the comment, Mr Schmitz told the Post, and reportedly said: \"I do know their stories\".\n\nIt's unclear from video of Mr Biden at the dignified transfer whether the president actually checked his watch during the solemn moment; he could be seen glancing down as he lowered his arms.

I am praying the British government can do something to bring him here and save him,\" she told the Sun on Sunday.\n\nSurgeons removed shrapnel from Muhammad's abdomen and repaired a rip in his intestines, the paper said.

They limit the potential for clarification, redemption, and learning. And sets a precedent I feel is dangerous: the power an individual or corporation has over a part of the global public conversation.\"\n\nThe ban drew criticism from some Republicans who said it quelled the president's right to free speech. German Chancellor Angela Merkel also warned through a spokesman that legislators, not private companies, should decide on potential curbs to free expression.\n\nIn his Twitter thread, Dorsey said that while he took no pride in the ban, \"Offline harm as a result of online speech is demonstrably real, and what drives our policy and enforcement above all.\"\n\nEven so, he added, \"While there are clear and obvious exceptions, I feel a ban is a failure of ours ultimately to promote healthy conversation.\"\n\nTwitter has introduced a series of measures over the last year such as labels, warnings and distribution restrictions to reduce the need for decisions about removing content entirely from the service.\n\n'Healthy' conversations\n\nDorsey has said he believes those measures can promote more fruitful, or \"healthy,\" conversations online and lessen the effect of bad behaviour.\n\nThe Twitter CEO added that bans by social media companies on Trump after last week's violence were emboldened by each other's actions even though they were not coordinated. But in the long term, the precedent set \"will be destructive to the noble purpose and ideals of the open internet,\" he said.\n\nSupporters of Trump who has repeatedly made baseless claims challenging Democrat Joe Biden's victory in the November election, stormed the US Capitol on January 6, trying to halt the certification by Congress of Biden's Electoral College win.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump became the first president in US history to be impeached twice."}

As the largest fuel pipeline in the U.S., its six-day stoppage led to fuel shortages and price increases.\n\nBut how much the shutdown actually affected these outcomes is the subject of a new article titled \"The Effect of the Colonial Pipeline Shutdown on Gasoline Prices.\" It's published in Economics Letters.\n\n\"We found the resulting increase in gas prices to be far less than the media initially reported,\" said Tsvetan Tsvetanov, associate professor of economics at the University of Kansas.\n\n\"When looking at the six days from the closure to its reopening, there's barely any price effect until the very end of this period. What we really saw was delayed and persistent impacts. So when we read in the news how the problem had been solved and the pipeline's being reopened, that's actually when we truly began to feel the effect of this.\"\n\nHis article, co-written with KU doctoral student Srishti Slaria, uses daily regular gasoline price data at the city level and employs a difference-in-differences approach to address potential demand-side confounding factors. While in May, fuel prices spiked to levels that were the highest in seven years, Tsvetanov discovered the Colonial Pipeline incident only led to a 4-cents-per-gallon increase in average gasoline prices in affected areas.\n\nLaunched in 1963, the 5,550-mile pipeline is the nation's largest for refined oil products. Its two tubes can carry 3 million barrels of fuel per day between Texas and New York.\n\n\"That's basically the bulk of the supply of fuel for the East Coast and the Southeast,\" Tsvetanov said. \"Some of these 18 states have local refineries. Some can rely on imports. If they have the river or seaports, they can access that. But mostly it's the Colonial Pipeline they rely on.\"\n\nIn May, just prior to the attack, dependence on oil products was escalating.\n\n\"At the time, we were seemingly coming out of the pandemic situation,\" he said. \"The economy was growing, more jobs were being created. Those were all demand-side factors that were pushing gas prices up. So the trick is, how do you parse out what would have been happening regardless from the fact of the pipeline shock?\""}

But in countries like Brazil, it caused a destabilizing and disorienting seven hours ― not because Facebook.com was gone, but because WhatsApp, the messaging service the company also owns, suddenly went offline along with it.\n\nStill largely an afterthought in the United States, WhatsApp has grown into one of the world's most vital communications services. More than 2 billion people ― 1 in 4 people on the planet ― use it. Brazil and India alone are home to nearly one-quarter of them.\n\nWhatsApp's text messaging and internet-based video and audio chat platforms are especially popular in the Global South, where WhatsApp is a cheap way to avoid the often-exorbitant costs of SMS messaging and cellular data. Nearly half of Brazilians say WhatsApp is their most-used app, and more than 90% of the country's internet users are WhatsAppers — as is also the case in Kenya, South Africa, Nigeria, Argentina, Malaysia and Colombia. Facebook and Instagram, which Facebook also owns, are the second and third most popular apps in Brazil, surveys have shown.\n\nThat ubiquity has essentially turned WhatsApp into a public utility: It's so crucial to global communications infrastructure that when it goes down, entire countries, segments of their economies, and even some basic daily governmental activities nearly grind to a halt.\n\n\"It was basically like the entire internet was out.

No, I am not just talking about the killing of 20-year-old Duante Wright literally a stone's throw away from where George Floyd was murdered; nor am I talking about 13-year-old Adam Toledo in Chicago. I am actually talking about 15-year-old Ma'Khia Bryant who was killed in Columbus, Ohio almost simultaneously to the time when the Chauvin verdict was being handed down.\n\nSince the start of the Chauvin trial three weeks ago, over 60 people have been killed by police in the United States. Over 1,000 people are killed by police every year. Only half of these killings are actually ruled as justifiable and yet well less than 1% of officers are ever charged or convicted. This has not stopped taxpayers from dishing out billions of dollars in misconduct settlements.\n\nSo, while people are viewing Chauvin's murder conviction as an indictment on policing as a whole, this is clearly not the case. The Chauvin verdict was just for one killing. What people actually want is accountability for the entire system. As I mentioned to NBC News, \"In court, individuals are prosecuted... Because of the over individualization of our court system, institutions are let off the hook. The court system magnifies the bad apple narrative.\"\n\nSteven Schleicher, who along with fellow prosecutor Jerry Blackwell and the rest of the team assembled by Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, was masterful. But even he stated as such during closing arguments. Schleicher stated, \"He (referring to Chauvin) is on trial for what he did, not who he was.\" Schleicher was aiming to highlight that Chauvin lost his right to be called a cop. He was also admitting the realization that it is difficult to convict police officers of crimes, especially when a white cop does something to a Black person.\n\nThough the Chauvin trial had all the elements to make this a slam dunk decision, the case was a litmus test on police-community relations and race relations in America. I mean if there was not a conviction in this case, what would it say about how far we still have to go as a nation? There was a myriad of video evidence, numerous in-person witnesses who saw the crime, a slew of officers testifying against Chauvin that his actions were unreasonable, a slew of medical experts, an all-star prosecution team, and a racially-diverse jury. Sadly, it takes this kind of overwhelming evidence in order to convict police officers in America, even officers who have nearly 20 misconduct complaints.\n\nAltogether, the Chauvin trial was an exemplar. However, it remains an outlier and far from the norm of what typically happens when police use unjustifiable force and do not get convicted.\n\nPatrick Yoes, The National President of the Fraternal Order of Police stated on CNN that \"we can go one step closer to getting past this very dark day in American history.\" His statement suggests that Chauvin was acting in isolation and not with three other former officers, one of whom pulled a gun on Floyd minutes earlier and another, Chauvin's former partner, who had a series of misconduct complaints. Chauvin was not just a bad apple operating in isolation. Rather, he was part of a rotten tree in policing that allowed him to proliferate."}

On the most recent season, \"American Horror Story: Double Feature,\" Grossman recalls only using rubber guns, even while shooting them.\n\n\"I even said, 'Wait, is this gonna look super fake?' And they're like, 'Oh, we can fix anything later to make it look super real.' And they did, and it looked really real,\" she said.\n\nThe deadly shooting on the set of the independent film \"Rust\" that killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and wounded director Joel Souza involved a real firearm fired by actor Alec Baldwin that contained live rounds rather thank blanks. In the tragedy's aftermath, the industry is facing the question of whether real firearms should ever again be allowed on a set.\n\nIn response to the \"Rust\" tragedy, ABC's cop drama \"The Rookie\" banned real firearms. Eric Kripke, showrunner of Amazon's gritty superhero series \"The Boys,\" tweeted that he was taking \"a simple, easy pledge: no more guns with blanks on any of my sets ever.\"\n\nA Change.org petition to ban real guns from movie and TV productions has nearly 70,000 signatures. California state senator Dave Cortese says he plans to introduce legislation to officially ban real firearms and live ammunition from all productions, and New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said her state would take similar action should the entertainment industry not adopt such a ban voluntarily.\n\nBandar Albuliwi, a filmmaker and author of the Change.org petition, is incredulous that the practice of using real firearms carries on, citing deaths of actor Brandon Lee on the set of the 1993 film \"The Crow\" and camerawoman Sarah Jones on the 2014 production of \"Midnight Rider\" (unrelated to firearms) as prior examples that should have made set safety a top priority across the industry.\n\n\"This shouldn't have happened after Brandon Lee basically shot himself,\" said Albuliwi. \"Hollywood hasn't changed in 30 years. We again thought we'd learned our lesson about better protocols with 'Midnight Rider.' That caused a little stir but dissipated. This speaks volumes about our industry because, in this event, this only got attention because it involved an A-list actor like Alec Baldwin.\"\n\nCameron Kasky, a survivor of the 2018 Parkland mass shooting and gun control activist, agrees with Albuliwi. \"All real guns should be banned from sets,\" he says. \"Fake guns look very real. If studios have even the slightest regard for workers, real guns would be completely out of the question.\"\n\nFor decades, real firearms with blank ammunition have been used in film and TV productions because they visually recreate actual gunfire. But in discussions with industry insiders and visual effects experts, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity, many said that advances in visual effects technology mean banning real weapons would result in virtually no sacrifice to the look and feel of a finished piece of content.\n\n\"If in the background, there's a dinosaur running around, you know, that's where the money is,\" said one longtime VFX artist. \"A couple of 'bang bang, smoky smoky' things is a sneeze compared to almost anything else.\"\n\nOften times, there is minimal lifting required in post-production to make a fake gun look as if it has been discharged, experts said. A \"muzzle flash,\" or the appearance of smoke and light from the barrel of a gun, is easily created with software used by editors and digital intermediate houses.\n\n\"Doing just a muzzle flash, it's nothing,\" says the effects artist. \"It's minutes of work per shot — maybe a tiny glow, maybe a tiny bit of interactive light.\"\n\nMore elaborate sequences involving gunfire, especially those that involve an actor flinching in reaction to an overpowering weapon, could necessitate more intensive visual effects work.\n\n\"It's essentially performance modification, and that's what would move it to the next level,\" says the artist.\n\nBut even in these cases, this artist notes these are actions an actor \"can absolutely mimic\" in their performance.\n\nTaking real firearms off a set would also remove potential lethal hazards caused by the kind of negligence that's been alleged to have occurred on \"Rust\" — from union crews walking and the hiring of scabs, to improper protocols handling weaponry. Veterans in the production coordination space, basically those in charge of \"Hollywood's back office\" as one put it, said that standard safety protocols often go overlooked, particularly on productions outside entertainment's backyard in Los Angeles.\n\n\"West Coast unions require safety classes through CSATF,\" said one top production coordinator, referring to the digital portal Contract Services, which provides training and other functions for film and TV shoots.\n\nThrough Contract Services, employees take state-mandated courses like sexual harassment education and, of course, safety training. These union-mandated program also issues daily safety bulletins with the production call sheet, briefing the entire production on the stunts and other hazards of the day.\n\n\"We're supposed to check the status of each and every union crew member before they are hired,\" says the coordinator. \"This isn't nationwide and people don't often use it.\"\n\nThese issues speak to a larger, more pernicious attitude involving on-set safety and wellbeing — and a culture of silence that has kept people from speaking up."}

The Post published what amounted to a defense of the Taliban's \"strikingly sophisticated\" social media prowess and juxtaposed it with Donald Trump's.\n\n\"For a group that espouses ancient moral codes, the Afghan Taliban has used strikingly sophisticated social media tactics to build political momentum and, now that they're in power, to make a public case that they're ready to lead a modern nation state after nearly 20 years of war,\" two of the Post's technology reporters wrote.\n\n\"The answer, analysts said, may simply be that Trump's posts for years challenged platform rules against hate speech and inciting violence,\" the piece adds. \"Today's Taliban, by and large, does not.\"\n\nAh, okay — so Twitter should totally keep an organization on its platform to spread propaganda and recruit because ...why again? The Taliban's actions, not its words, need to be taken into account here, because its words and actions contradict each another.\n\nJust this week, the Taliban reportedly killed a woman in Kabul for the crime of not wearing a burqa. Women and children are being whipped and beaten in the streets. Young girls are reportedly being forced to marry Taliban fighters. Anyone rumored to have worked with the U.S. is being executed. Proof? Due process? You're kidding, right?\n\nGiven those facts, how does Twitter justify allowing the Taliban to remain on its platform, which will only make it more powerful?\n\nPerhaps predictably, the Washington Post's defense got torched on social media.\n\nThe Taliban remains on Twitter. The 45th president is banned, likely for life. Agree or disagree with Trump, there is something very, very wrong with this.\n\nJoe Concha is a media and politics columnist for The Hill and a Fox News contributor."}

Hackers have taken down JBS, the world's largest meat processor, disrupting the global meat market, closed schools in Iowa and hit hospitals in Ireland in what experts say is a dangerous escalation of a crime wave that has swelled from the small-scale blackmail operations of a few years ago to major assaults that threaten the livelihoods – and potentially lives – of millions.\n\nMany of the recent attacks have been sourced to operations in Russia and US officials say that Russia's responsibility for ransomware attacks carried out from its territory would be a central issue when Joe Biden meets Vladimir Putin in Geneva next Wednesday.\n\n\"One of the things that President Biden will make clear to President Putin, when he sees him, is that states cannot be in the business of harboring those who are engaged in these kinds of attacks,\" the secretary of state, Tony Blinken, told Congress this week.\n\nEric Green, the senior director for Russia and central Asia in the national security council, said that one of the expected outcomes from the Geneva summit was a routine dialogue between senior US and Russian officials aimed at bringing greater stability and predictability to the relationship. One of the issues in the dialogue would be ransomware attacks.\n\n\"When we talk about strategic stability cyber will also certainly be on the agenda,\" Green said in a recent discussion organised by the Centre for a New American Security. \"The recent ransomware attacks remind us that the cyber domain is prone to misperceptions and that there are dangerous escalation risks.\"\n\nUS officials say America will be pushing for Nato to expand its involvement in cyberdefence at the alliance summit in Brussels. But the unanswered question is how to respond to ransomware attacks by criminal groups for whom their host countries deny responsibility.\n\n\"Putin will deny interfering in US politics or conducting cyber-attacks, asserting that Washington has no proof, while rejecting the legitimacy of US concerns about what happens within Russia,\" said Steven Pifer, former deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs and now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\n\"Biden should not waste time arguing. He should aim instead to ensure that Putin has a clear understanding of what conduct is out of bounds.\"\n\nThe pressure for Biden to act is rising. There has been a 62% increase in ransomware globally since 2019, and 158% spike in North America, according to the 2021 SonicWall Cyber Threat Report. Alongside that rise, the nature of the crimes and their targets are also changing.\n\n\"We are seeing more attacks, more sophisticated attacks, bigger attacks and the scary thing is we are seeing them more on supply chains,\" said Donnan. \"It used to be about financial exfiltration, stealing money, and reputational damage. It's now in a life-threatening environment. That is a dramatic change.\"\n\nNow a partner at the cybersecurity private equity investor Option3Ventures, Donnan says she doesn't expect to see any let-up in attacks. Nation states including Russia, China and North Korea are getting more ambitious in their attacks and the criminal enterprises that operate under their wings are getting more brazen.\n\n\"The landscape is ripe and ready for attack from a perfect storm of hackers, nation states and the average cybercriminal,\" she said.\n\nPart of the recent surge is down to the pandemic, which has helped the hackers by accelerating the digitization of business and giving them more access points as people and businesses have moved to work remotely.\n\nOn top of that there has been an explosion in software development, much of which was not built with security in mind from the beginning, said Donnan. \"We still have a culture of get to market, be first. We are designing code without security in mind,\" she said."}

For one film expert, the tragedy underscores the importance of training and oversight during sequences involving firearms.\n\n\"With the sets I work on, I work with very large crowds, up to 500 people,\" Paul Biddiss, a former British Army paratrooper turned-military advisor, told Task & Purpose. \"Weapons safety is always going to be paramount when you're working with any sort of weapon.\"\n\nBaldwin, a producer and the star of the western film \"Rust,\" fired a prop gun while filming at Bonanza Creek Ranch, in Santa Fe County, around 1:50 p.m. on Thursday, killing Halyna Hutchins, 42, the film's director of photography, and injuring director Joel Souza, 48.\n\n\"This investigation remains open and active,\" the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Department said in a statement. \"No charges have been filed in regard to this incident. Witnesses continue to be interviewed by detectives.\"\n\nThe New York Times reported on Friday that the shooting took place during a scene that was either being actively filmed or was rehearsed.\n\n\"My heart is broken for her husband, their son, and all who knew and loved Halyna,\" Baldwin said after the incident, adding that he was \"fully cooperating with the police investigation.\n\nSuch incidents are rare in the film industry due to extensive safety protocols typically followed during film sequences involving firearms, and has resulted in a flurry of discussion about safety measures on set when firearms are used.\n\nTo get a better sense of those safety protocols, Task & Purpose spoke with Biddiss, who served 24 years in the British Army before segueing to a career as a military advisor in film and television. Biddiss has worked on numerous action, and firearms-heavy projects, from the World War I epic \"1917\" to the crime caper \"Wrath of Man\" and \"Fury,\" which followed a tank crew in World War II.\n\nWhile some sets use prop weapons that don't fire anything at all, many of the weapons used are actual firearms that have been modified to fire only blanks, Biddiss said. Blank ammunition has all the components of a normal round, except for the projectile, and the shell casing is crimped at the round's tip.\n\nBut even though a weapon can only fire blanks, they can still be dangerous, and so film crews take extensive steps to ensure safety protocols are adhered to.\n\n\"Although they're blanks, there are still bits and pieces that will come out — sparks and bits of dust that will fly out, and some pressure,\" Bidess said. \"A blank can actually do you a huge amount of damage. If it was pressed right up against your head, it could probably kill you.\"\n\nWhen filming with semi- and fully automatic weapons that are gas-operated, meaning the combustion gas from firing a round is what reloads the weapon, the barrel typically has a mechanism called a \"restrictor.\" Restrictors function similarly to the blank-firing adapters (BFAs) used in the military, except that the device is internal, rather than attached to the exterior of the muzzle.\n\n\"They have it down the barrel to conceal that there's an actual restrictor,\" said Biddiss. \"That helps to recycle the rounds so you've got the automatic effect and the recoil and everything else.\"\n\nDevices like BFAs or restrictors do two things: they help prevent debris from escaping the barrel through the muzzle when a blank round is fired; and they help the weapon chamber another round by preventing the combustion gases from escaping the barrel."}

The sale includes deals on firearms, optics, bags and gun parts, among other items.\n\nThe decision to promote the sale using an image of Rittenhouse was met with mixed emotions. The 18-year-old was acquitted Friday on charges stemming from killing two men and wounding another during the unrest that followed the shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, by a white police officer last year.\n\n\"We celebrated the acquittal from a Second Amendment standpoint and a right to defend yourself point,\" said Saddle River Range owner Thomas Bolsch. \"We did not celebrate and do not celebrate the loss of life.\"\n\nLongtime customer Austin Mack says he doesn't understand why people were offended.\n\nBut another customer wrote on the store's Instagram page, \"I really respect this store.

The next minute, two people were bleeding from gunshot wounds – one of which would prove to be fatal – and everyone was reeling from confusion and shock.\n\nHere is a moment-by-moment account of what happened that day, based on a search warrant affidavit and 911 calls.\n\nA sudden shot rang out on set\n\nThe crew was filming on October 21, 2021, at Bonanza Creek Ranch, a Western movie set outside Santa Fe, New Mexico. In the film, Baldwin plays a grizzled outlaw on the run from authorities with his 13-year-old grandson.\n\nMornings typically started with breakfast at 6:30 a.m., but that day they were behind schedule.

Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), the lead impeachment manager, spoke by far the most words of anyone in the first seven days of the trial (nearly four times as many words as the second most prominent speaker), the impeachment managers have spread the speaking time a little more evenly this time.\n\nRep. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.), the lead impeachment manager for this trial, has spoken just over 26,000 words, while Rep. David N. Cicilline (D-R.I.), Rep. Joe Neguse (D-Colo.), and Del.

On Day Four, some senators stepped forward to offer questions to each side.\n\nA few, though, spoke more often. Majority Leader Charles E.

The U.S. said it was the most lethal day for American forces in Afghanistan since 2011. The number of dead was subject to change as authorities examined the dismembered remains."}

To me, this was the right thing to do.\n\n\"I don't think anyone looking at it, particularly what we know now — only some of which is public — could have decided to just allow those two individuals to move forward in their life and never have any consequences.\"\n\nThe Crumbleys have pleaded not guilty to four counts of involuntary manslaughter. Ethan Crumbley has been charged with terrorism and murder and has also pleaded not guilty.\n\nMcDonald said the investigation into the shooting had uncovered a number of details that she felt made the charges of involuntary manslaughter necessary.\n\nShe said Jennifer Crumbley \"proudly\" posted on social media just four days before the shooting that she had purchased a gun for her son as an early Christmas present.\n\nShe said both parents were also called to the school on the morning of the shooting to talk about \"troubling writing\" their son had been found with.\n\n\"Pictures of guns, pictures of someone being shot, words like 'blood everywhere',\" McDonald said.\n\n\"They were asked to take their son home, and they resisted. Both of them left, never told the school that he had full access to a weapon, which he clearly did."}

At the time of his death, Volar was awaiting trial for human trafficking. Kenosha law enforcement had seized photos and digital evidence that showed Volar sexually assaulting a series of young Black women and advertising them for sex. When Kizer was first arrested and charged with his murder, law enforcement initially withheld this evidence from her public defender.\n\nKizer claims that she shot Volar in self-defense before setting his home ablaze in 2018.

Bank of Japan already ended QE. Bank of Canada shed 15% of its assets. Bank of England & Reserve Bank of Australia are tapering. Reserve Bank of New Zealand quit QE cold turkey. Riksbank will end QE this year. What's taking the Fed so long?\n\nThe ECB has increased the assets on its balance sheet by a monstrous €154 billion ($181 billion) per month so far this year via an alphabet soup of programs, blowing by even the crazed money-printers at the Fed with their average rate of $123 billion a month. While there appears to be consensus at the Fed that \"tapering\" its asset purchases will begin this year and will be completed in the first half next year, with assets then remaining level, the ECB announced today that it will start tapering its asset purchases now.\n\nAnd thereby it is way behind the Bank of Japan, the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, and the Reserve Bank of Australia. But ahead of the Fed.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of the Bank of England, which had denied in May that its tapering was tapering, and in the footsteps of the Bank of Canada, which had denied last October that its tapering was tapering – though it has since then cut QE to nearly nothing and shed 15% of its assets – ECB President Christine Lagarde also denied at the press conference today that tapering was tapering, and stressed that tapering was instead a \"recalibration\" of QE.\n\nMarkets eagerly swallow these taper denials hook, line, and sinker. Anything but tapering.\n\nIn the press release, the ECB said that the pace of net asset purchases under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program (PEPP) would be \"moderately lower.\" PEPP is the biggie in the alphabet soup of programs, running at about €80 billion ($95 billion) per month recently.\n\nThe ECB didn't specify by how much it would reduce its purchases under PEPP, but said that it would \"purchase flexibly according to market conditions.\"\n\nThe asset purchases under PEPP will continue in diminished form \"at least\" until March 2022. After that, the balance would be level \"at least\" until the end of 2023, before the \"roll-off\" of those bonds might begin. The roll-off means that bonds mature and roll off the balance sheet when they're redeemed and would not be replaced with new purchases. This has the effect of reducing the bond portfolio over time as bonds mature.\n\nThe other programs would go on as before.\n\nThe Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO III) will continue. These are loans to Eurozone banks, now with a balance of €2.2 trillion.\n\nThe Asset Purchase Program (APP), the now relatively small classic QE program that existed before the pandemic and includes sovereign bonds, corporate bonds, covered bonds, and asset-backed securities, would continue at a monthly rate of €20 billion and would \"end shortly before\" the ECB starts raising its interest rates.\n\nThis is in line with the consensus among central banks, confirmed by the Fed, that QE needs to end before interest rates can be hiked, on the rationale that QE pushes down long-term rates, while raising policy rates pushes up short-term rates, which would wreak havoc on the yield curve."}

The IRS said it has delivered more than 8 million of the supplemental payments this year.\n\nAnother 900,000 payments went out over the past two weeks to people whom the IRS did not previously have enough information for but who recently filed tax returns. Many of those are very low-income people who aren't normally required to file tax returns because their incomes fall below the filing threshold. They were encouraged to file this year to claim the stimulus money they are eligible for.\n\nThe IRS will continue to send out \"plus-up\" payments to those who recently filed tax returns on a weekly basis. More than 169 million households have received stimulus money this year to date.\n\nWho gets a third stimulus payment?\n\nThe third round of payments, which was authorized by Congress in March, are worth up to $1,400 per person and expected to reach 85% of households, according to the White House.\n\nFamilies will receive an additional $1,400 per dependent, so a couple with two children could get up to $5,600. Unlike prior rounds, families will receive the additional money for adult dependents over the age of 17.\n\nThe full amount goes to individuals earning less than $75,000 of adjusted gross income, heads of households (like single parents) earning less than $112,500 and married couples earning less than $150,000. Then the payments gradually phase out as income goes up.\n\nIndividuals who earn at least $80,000 a year of adjusted gross income, heads of households who earn at least $120,000 and married couples who earn at least $160,000 are completely cut off – regardless of how many children they have.\n\nMore cash on the way for families with children\n\nThe latest pandemic aid package also increased the size of the child tax credit and called for it to be sent out in periodic payments that will begin to go out on July 15.\n\nThe IRS has started sending letters notifying more than 36 million families who, based on tax returns, may be eligible for the child tax credit payments. Most won't have to do anything to receive the money, which will be based on information provided on the 2020 or 2019 tax returns. An online portal will be made available later in the summer that will allow families to update information regarding their incomes, number of children and bank accounts.\n\nThose payments will technically be an advance on a 2021 tax credit. Eligible parents will receive $3,600 for each child under 6 and $3,000 for each child under age 18. Until now, the credit was up to only $2,000 per child under age 17. At least half of the amount will go out over the summer and the remainder will be lumped in with next year's tax refund.\n\nThe enhanced portion of the credit will be available for single parents with annual incomes up to $75,000 and joint filers making up to $150,000 a year.\n\nCongress also made the child tax credit fully refundable so more low-income families can benefit. Previously, if the credit exceeded the taxes owed, parents could receive only up to $1,400 as a refund. These households also must have earned income of at least $2,500. The change could make 20 million more children eligible."}

The blast killed 169 Afghans and 13 US service members and was one of the deadliest attacks in the country in years.\n\nAn Italian-funded emergency hospital in Kabul tweeted it had received four people wounded in the blast.\n\n\"We received four patients, three of them had shrapnel injuries while one had a bullet wound,\" Marco Puntin, country director in Afghanistan for Emergency, told Al Jazeera.\n\nPuntin said he heard gunshots shortly after the blast, adding that all four patients were alive and in stable conditions.\n\nSuspects arrested\n\nTaliban fighters were not harmed in the attack, Taliban spokesman Bilal Karimi told The Associated Press news agency. Those killed in the attack were civilians outside the mosque gate.\n\n\"I heard the sound of an explosion near the Eid Gah Mosque followed by gun firing,\" Abdullah, a nearby shopkeeper, told the AFP news agency, adding that the Taliban blocked the road shortly before the blast struck.\n\nAmbulances carrying the wounded were seen rushing towards Kabul's Emergency Hospital in the Shahr-e-Naw area.\n\nThree suspects were arrested following Sunday's explosion, said Karimi, a Taliban spokesman.\n\nThe area around the mosque was cordoned off by the Taliban, who maintained a heavy security presence. Later in the afternoon, the site was cleaned.\n\nThe only sign of the blast was slight damage to the ornamental arch by the entrance gate.\n\nNo immediate claim of responsibility\n\nThere was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.\n\nHowever, since the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in mid-August, attacks by ISIL (ISIS)-affiliated fighters against them have increased. The rise has raised the possibility of a wider conflict between the two groups.\n\nReporting from Kabul, Al Jazeera's Osama Bin Javaid said: \"This is a big dent in Taliban's claim that this country is seeing unprecedented peace and security.\"\n\n\"This attack is certainly going to send shockwaves across Afghanistan as people ask how secure it really is,\" he added.\n\nSecurity challenge\n\nThe explosion underscored the growing challenges the Taliban faces just weeks after they took control of Afghanistan in a blitz campaign, culminating in their takeover of Kabul on August 15.\n\nDuring the 20-year US occupation of Afghanistan, the Taliban had frequently carried out bombing and shooting attacks, but are now faced with trying to contain rival armed groups using the same methods.\n\nThe growing security challenges come at a time of an economic meltdown, as the Taliban struggles to run the country without the massive foreign aid given to the US-backed government they toppled.\n\nISKP has stepped up attacks against the Taliban since the mid-August takeover. It maintains a strong presence in the eastern province of Nangarhar, where it has claimed responsibility for several killings in the provincial capital of Jalalabad.\n\nAttacks in Kabul have so far been rare, but in recent weeks ISKP has shown signs it is expanding its footprint beyond the east and closer towards the capital.\n\nOn Friday, Taliban fighters raided a hideout belonging to an ISIL affiliate just north of Kabul in Parwan province. The raid came after an ISKP roadside bomb wounded four Taliban fighters in the area."}

He even suggested that it was safer for the subject because if they get up and fall they might hurt their face.\n\n\"It doesn't hurt. You've put the suspect in a position where it's safe for you, the officer, safe for them, the suspect, and you're using minimal effort to keep them on the ground,\" Brodd said.\n\nOn cross-examination, Brodd explained that he doesn't consider the prone control position to be a use of force because it does not cause pain. Prosecutor Steve Schleicher then showed Brodd a still image of Chauvin's knee digging into Floyd's neck and asked whether that position might cause pain. Brodd said it \"could,\" so Schleicher asked him if that means Chauvin's action was a use of force.\n\n\"Shown in this picture, that could be a use of force,\" Brodd said.\n\nBrodd's testimony came Tuesday as the defense called its first six witnesses in Chauvin's trial, including two who discussed Floyd's prior arrest and drug use in May 2019. Together, the witnesses furthered the defense's three main arguments in the case: that Floyd died due to drug and health problems, that Chauvin's use of force was ugly but appropriate, and that a hostile crowd of bystanders distracted Chauvin.\n\nThe prosecution rested its case in the morning after calling 38 witnesses over 11 days. Prosecutors sought to prove that Chauvin used excessive and unreasonable force when he kneeled on Floyd's neck and back for nine minutes and 29 seconds last May. Their case relied heavily on multiple videos of Chauvin's actions, analysis by policing experts and medical testimony as to how Floyd died.\n\nOne of the final witnesses to take the stand Monday was Floyd's brother Philonise, who cried as he described his brother as a big mama's boy who was distraught by her death in 2018.\n\n\"It was so unique how they were with each other. He would lay up onto her in the fetus position like he was still in the womb,\" he said. \"Being around him, he showed us how to treat our mom and how to respect our mom. He just – he loved her so dearly.\"\n\nChauvin, 45, has pleaded not guilty to second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter charges. The defense's case is expected to last only a few days, and closing arguments are expected for next Monday, Judge Peter Cahill said Monday.\n\nPolicing expert says prone control position isn't use of force\n\nBarry Brodd testified on Tuesday that Derek Chauvin \"was acting with objective reasonableness.\" Pool\n\nMuch of Brodd's testimony starkly contradicted the prosecution's policing experts and Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, who said Chauvin's actions were \"in no way, shape or form\" within department policy, training, ethics or values.\n\nFor one, Brodd said it didn't matter that Floyd was already handcuffed because any person resisting should go to the ground in a prone control position."}

Trump has now been acquitted of inciting a riotous mob to attack the Capitol on January 6, an episode that interrupted the final tally of Electoral College votes that sealed Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nHere are six takeaways from Trump's history-making trial:\n\nOffered an opening, Democrats let Trump off\n\nHouse Democrats forced Trump's second impeachment, presenting a compelling case that he incited an attack on the Capitol, and driving a wedge between Republicans willing to look the other way versus those abhorred by Trump's behavior.\n\nOn Saturday morning, after CNN's Jamie Gangel reported shocking new details about Trump's behavior on January 6, Democrats found themselves on the cusp of demanding true accountability. They were joined by five Republicans in an effort to call witnesses – especially Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, the Washington Republican who has been instrumental in calling out the Trump defense team's counterfactual claim that Trump opposed the rioters rather than cheering them.\n\nFinding enough Republicans to convict Trump was still going to be a high bar and the Democrats would have had to offer Republicans a chance to call their own witness. But rather than push ahead and exploit the opening, Democrats decided to enter a written statement from Herrera Beutler into the record, allowing the impeachment trial to proceed toward Trump's expected acquittal.\n\nHaving the trial over will help Biden get down to business. But it will leave Americans who hoped Trump could be blocked from future political office wondering what might have been if Democrats had been a little more ruthless in their protection of the Constitution.\n\nThe GOP is still Trump's party\n\nTrump once quipped that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and not lose any voters. (His lawyers subsequently pushed a claim in court that, as president, Trump couldn't be charged for doing that, either.) It turns out that he could also dispatch a riotous mob up Pennsylvania Avenue to attack the US Capitol – with his own vice president inside – and most Republican senators would stick by him.\n\nSeven Republican senators voted that Trump was guilty of incitement, but most Republicans argued that the trial itself was unconstitutional because Trump was no longer president, saying that fact trumped any evidence presented during the trial.\n\nIn moments of frustration with the GOP, Trump has mused about starting his own political party, but it doesn't seem he needs to. When his lawyers manufactured an alternate reality in which he was calling for peace as rioters sacked the Capitol, the Republicans who were among those targeted by the mob grasped at the lifeline. That they could watch video of Mike Pence's evacuation and Utah Sen. Mitt Romney's near-miss with rioters alongside Trump's words leading up to the riot and then vote to acquit him is just the latest evidence that Trump's sway over the party is far from diminished."}

But Coleman said there's room for a variety of approaches to the use of firearms on set, as long as safety isn't compromised.\n\nThat can be challenging at times, Coleman said.\n\n\"If I only worked with firearms, there would never be any problems. But I also work with people,\" he said. So while safety is his main concern, other factors do come into play.\n\nIn Wilmington in general, \"Things have improved dramatically since ('The Crow') in 1993,\" Coleman said, noting that there have been no major accidents locally in more than 20 years. \"But do I get complacent? No.\"\n\nAlmost all of the well-known on-set accidents in Wilmington took place in the 1980s and 1990s, which would seem to indicate set safety locally has improved.\n\nHere are five times that accidents on film sets in Wilmington made national news.\n\n'Maximum Overdrive,' 1986\n\nBased on a short story by Stephen King — who also directed the movie — about machines that come to life and start to attack people, \"Maximum Overdrive\" is also known for an on-set accident that seriously injured director of photography Armando Nannuzzi."}

If we don't protect our data, it is wide open for our competitors to steal or manipulate and to disrupt our military operations,\" he said.\n\nKendall is not the only defense official concerned with the department's vulnerability to cyber attacks.\n\nOn Tuesday, Air Force Gen. Jacqueline Van Ovost pointed to the Colonial Pipeline hack as an example of the \"growing threat\" of cyber attacks and said cybersecurity would be one of her top priorities as the new head of US Transportation Command.\n\n\"If you can imagine a cyber criminal ... can cause fuel prices to rise, what could a persistent threat — a persistent and very capable threat — do to our systems?\" she asked the audience at NDTA.\n\nWhile the ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline did not directly assault military networks or other infrastructure, the event raised questions about the safety of networks used by commercial companies that form a key part of the Defense Department's logistics backbone.\n\nThe department relies on commercial vendors for gas, jet fuel, and the transportation of goods and people — all critical commodities for TRANSCOM, which uses military assets to move troops and supplies but also contracts directly with industry for additional airlift, sea freight transportation and other delivery services.\n\nAny disruption to the department's commercial vendors or its supply chain — or more widely, to the military's own infrastructure — could be devastating in a war, Kendall said.\n\n\"Our adversaries can be assumed to be able to disrupt our networks right now, because we have not sufficiently guarded against an attack,\" Kendall said. \"Fewer than half of trucking and logistics companies even have a chief information security officer. What does that mean for our supply chain?\"\n\nBefore being sworn in as Air Force secretary, Kendall spoke with the House Armed Services Committee's task force on supply chain resilience and tried to convey the importance of ensuring the security of the defense industrial base and logistics enterprise, he said.\n\n\"Peacetime supply chain disruptions and shortages were a problem certainly, but a manageable one,\" he said. \"Wartime disruptions and shortages, on the other hand, could be much more problematic and in fact decisive.\"\n\nThe Pentagon will need more funding in order to help mitigate current logistics vulnerabilities, Kendall said. Specifically, the military needs more weapons storage facilities and hardened fuel storage infrastructure, and it also needs to ensure that the commercial transportation industry can recruit talented employees.\n\n\"We must also acquire more resilient transportation systems of systems,\" he said. \"We know our current capabilities are vulnerable to cyber and kinetic attacks. We must address that harsh reality by incorporating the certainties of offensive cyber and kinetic attacks into our military requirements and into our acquisition plans.\"\n\nThe Pentagon's nominee for director of operational test and evaluation (DOT&E) also signaled on Tuesday that the department may need to do more to ensure its own weapons and equipment can stand up to cyber attacks."}

Far from it! The way we treated Native Americans was horrific. It goes against every bone and everything I've ever fought for, as a leader, in the Congress.\"\n\nHowever, he did not apologize for his remarks in the speech.\n\nHuffPost, which first reported the news, said Santorum's contract was \"terminated,\" and quoted a source who said the \"Cuomo Prime Time\" interview was not well-received inside the network.\n\n\"Leadership wasn't particularly satisfied with that appearance.

He also said decisions by Facebook and other companies to keep him off social media are an \"unfair\" attempt to silence him and his supporters.\n\n\"They want to silence you,\" Trump said at one point during his speech in Greenville, North Carolina.\n\nIn his first televised speech since late February, Trump issued standard attacks on President Joe Biden and \"radical Democrats,\" while repeating baseless claims of \"voter fraud\" in his 2020 election loss. Trump pledged to help Republicans win back Congress in the 2022 elections and suggested he might run again for president himself in 2024.\n\nRepublicans in North Carolina, which Trump carried in both the 2016 and 2020 elections, gave the ex-president a warm reception.\n\nThe question is how well his continuing protests of the 2020 election and his complaint-filled rhetoric will be seen by independents and Republicans who want to see the party move past the fractious ex-president.\n\nDoug Heye, a Republican strategist and North Carolina native who has worked many political races in the state, said Trump's message plays well with true believers but may not appeal to other Republicans and voters in general.\n\n\"There's nothing new here,\" Heye said. \"We've all heard this song before.\"\n\nSurprise endorsement in 2022 Senate race\n\nThis was Trump's first televised speech since his Feb. 28 appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, Florida. He used that occasion to threaten Republicans who criticized him over the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol in which fervent Trump supporters tried to stop the counting of electoral votes showing that Biden won.\n\nTrump wasn't as specific about Republican opponents in North Carolina, but did make disparaging comments in general about party members he considers disloyal.\n\nLooking ahead to 2022, Trump made a surprise endorsement in a North Carolina race for a U.S. Senate seat. He said he would back U.S. Rep. Ted Budd over other Republicans seeking the party's nomination, an endorsement he made after his daughter-in-law, North Carolina native Lara Trump, confirmed to the crowd she would not run for the job herself.\n\nThe winner will replace one of Trump's frequent targets, Sen.

We should prepare for cyber and biological attacks.\n\nThe effects of the ransomware attack that shut down the Colonial Pipeline and disrupted East Coast gasoline supplies have eased. But as frustrating as that cyberattack was to consumers and business operators, consider this: Much worse things could damage critical infrastructure.\n\nWith terrorist groups and ill-meaning nation states like Iran and Syria striving to disrupt our way of life, future attacks are likely to occur in more than one domain. On Thursday, Microsoft warned that the Russian-based group behind last year's SolarWinds hack had launched a new campaign targeting 150 organizations, mostly in the United States.\n\nThe prolific hacker group, which Microsoft refers to as Nobelium and is widely believed to be run by Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, or SVR, launched the latest attacks after getting access to an email marketing service used by the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, according to Microsoft.\n\nWhile it is impossible to prepare for all possible scenarios, we should at least prepare for those that already have laid bare our weaknesses.\n\nAmerica Talks: Should the U.S. have stricter laws on the sale of guns?\n\nThe attack on the Colonial Pipeline and the spread of COVID-19 reveal troubling national vulnerabilities. We should prepare for both cyber and biological attacks to occur simultaneously.\n\nA report soon to be released by the Bipartisan Commission on Biodefense finds that all critical infrastructure sectors are at biological risk. The consequences of intentional, accidental and natural biological incidents occurring are truly worrisome.\n\nNone of our nation's 16 critical infrastructure sectors (including the health care and public health sector and the food and agriculture sector) has planned adequately for biological incidents.\n\nThey have not determined how they will operate in a biologically contaminated environment, identified how they contribute to biodefense, examined the biological threat to their operations, determined how they are vulnerable to biological threats or estimated the consequences of biological incidents harming their sectors.\n\nCritical infrastructure is unprotected\n\nIt is no wonder then that all critical infrastructure sectors found themselves unprotected and operationally compromised when COVID-19 spread to the United States and throughout the world.\n\nAnd if the private sector is looking to the federal government to do something about this, it will experience what we saw during the pandemic: a government that remains woefully underprepared.\n\nAll critical infrastructure owners and operators must accept that a biological incident will likely harm their sectors, and then plan and prepare accordingly. Ignoring the danger could well lead to horrendous consequences within each sector and throughout society.\n\nCOVID-19 provided a powerful example of how our nation's food and agriculture sector can easily be upended. Food-processing facilities were hit hard by the pandemic, forcing work stoppages when employees could not come to work.\n\nIn December 2014, migrating wild birds brought a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza to the United States. The ensuing outbreak resulted in the largest animal health disaster ever experienced by America.\n\nFederal and state governments spent $879 million in response. The outbreak affected 21 states, lasted until the middle of 2015 and led to the loss of more than 50 million birds on 232 farms.\n\nSubsequent trade bans affected as many as 233,770 farms. The total cost to the U.S. economy was estimated at $3.3 billion.\n\nThe estimated economic impact of COVID-19 to the U.S. economy is $16 trillion and climbing.\n\nBiological threats are increasing\n\nThe increasing rate of emerging and reemerging diseases, along with biological threats and attempts by those with nefarious intent to attack, point to the need to reduce the risk to America's critical infrastructure."}

Groups of workers fanned out in the darkness and started removing barricades and other structures that, for nearly a year, had cut off the flow of traffic on two major thoroughfares: Chicago Avenue and East Thirty-eighth Street. The reaction to what looked like a cross between a covert op and a public-works project was immediate; residents of the mixed-income neighborhood began texting and posting a flurry of messages on social media as they streamed out of their homes. Across town, one of those texts reached Jay Webb, a gardener and a caretaker of the Square. He got dressed and hustled out the door. Another observer said in a video on Instagram, \"Greetings from G.F.S. They're coming! They're coming!\"\n\nSince last summer, the barricades had told visitors that, as a hand-painted sign announced, \"you are now entering the Free State of George Floyd.\" At the center of the area was the intersection outside the Cup Foods grocery store, where Floyd died, on May 25, 2020, after the police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for nine minutes and twenty-nine seconds during an arrest, while three other officers stood by. In the chaotic fury that swept the nation in the days afterward, hundreds of businesses in Minneapolis were vandalized, and a hundred and fifty buildings, including the Third Precinct, where Chauvin worked, were set on fire. There were protests in the intersection, but mourners, activists, tourists, and community members soon turned the area into a sort of shrine, leaving messages, flowers, and candles. A painted silhouette marked the spot where Floyd had died.\n\nOne night, a week after his death, law-enforcement officials drove through the makeshift memorial. In response, residents dragged cinder blocks, furniture, and even an old refrigerator into the streets to block traffic. Mayor Jacob Frey, who at one point referred to the area as \"sacred ground,\" had concrete construction barriers placed at the intersection, ostensibly to protect pedestrians. But the barriers also deepened the sense that George Floyd Square was now a place unto itself. An ad-hoc committee of activists and residents erected and staffed guard shacks at entrances. An abandoned Speedway gas station was repurposed as the People's Way, and an improvised fire pit, set up between empty pumps, became a gathering place. Webb collected the detritus of the protests—bricks and plywood that had covered windows—and used it to build a roundabout structure in the middle of the intersection. It included a platform where visitors could leave flowers and messages, and a nine-foot-tall steel sculpture of a fist that the artist Jordan Powell Karis had designed, as a replica of an earlier wooden sculpture, and that residents helped assemble. The Square was becoming more than a shrine to Floyd's life; it was a monument to others who had died in encounters with police, and a headquarters for an emergent movement.\n\nThen, on April 20th of this year, Chauvin was convicted of two counts of murder and one count of manslaughter. On June 25th, Judge Peter Cahill sentenced him to twenty-two and a half years in prison. The three other officers will be tried next year, and federal indictments have been handed down against all four of them. Many Americans saw the verdict as a just resolution to a public tragedy. The Square's reopening seemed part of a general spirit of relief and a desire to move on from the horror of Floyd's death and the tensions that had turned Minneapolis into a microcosm of the national debate about race and policing.\n\nBut another view, held with at least equal resolve, considered the trial only one concern in a constellation of many that needed to be addressed before there could be anything resembling closure. During the trial, Webb, who stands six feet nine inches tall and looks to be about fifty (though he said that he considers himself just a day old—the day he's living), told me he was concerned that \"when the flowers die, and the helium is gone from the balloons, people will forget the entire case.\" The monument that he built was intended to prevent that from happening. \"This cannot just be another corner,\" he said. His implication was that, although the world saw Floyd's death as a singular incident of spectacular violence, people in parts of Minneapolis, particularly in the Square, were more likely to connect his death to a long genealogy of events that both preceded and followed it, and which few outside of that community knew much about."}

The motion states that prosecutors have since learned that the people with Rittenhouse at the bar included the leader of the Wisconsin Proud Boys chapter and several of its highest-ranking members.\n\nProsecutors allege Rittenhouse, who is white, left his home and traveled to Kenosha to answer a call for paramilitary groups to protect businesses during the protest.\n\nRittenhouse faces multiple charges, including two homicide counts. He has argued he fired in self-defense after protesters attacked him.\n\nBlack Lives Matter supporters have painted him as a trigger-happy white supremacist, but some conservatives see him as a symbol for gun rights and have rallied around him, generating $2 million for his bail in November.\n\nRittenhouse's defense attorney did not immediately respond to a message and email seeking comment on prosecutors' latest motion.\n\nRittenhouse's trial is scheduled to start Nov. 1."}

They've fought off a devastating oil spill, floods, changing markets and endless hurricanes just to stay in business.\n\nAfter Hurricane Ida, though, some wonder about their ability to continue in a seemingly endless cycle of recovery and readjustment.\n\nThe Category 4 hurricane that struck Louisiana late last month fractured some parts of the industry even worse than 2005's Katrina, which cost seafood businesses more than $1 billion. No one yet knows how many boats, docks and processors were lost because of Ida's relentless, 150-mph winds. Vessels that made it to the safest harbors fared the best, yet even some of them were destroyed by the storm's fury.\n\nLt. Gov. Billy Nungesser, whose office oversees seafood promotion, said some areas, like Lafitte, were all but wiped out. The damage is a devastating blow to people whose entire lives are intertwined with fishing and the Gulf Coast.\n\n\"This thing just seemed to beat and beat and beat, kind of mixing it up like a washing machine,\" Nungesser said. \"I think that slow-moving storm beating these boats against the docks, against each other, caused a lot more vessels to sink and have major damage.\"\n\nThe story of Ida's impact on Louisiana's $2.4 billion seafood industry, which employs more than 23,000 at last count, is unfolding across places that outsiders struggle to even pronounce: Parishes like Plaquemines, Lafourche, and Terrebonne, cities and hamlets including Pointe-aux-Chenes, Des Allemandes and Houma. There, seafood families go back generations.\n\nThe people who make their living off the Gulf bounty are pledging to come back again this time provided another hurricane doesn't wipe them out first. But there are other challenges ahead as Louisiana tries to save a vanishing coastline, an industry and a way of life, all at the same time.\n\nRAINING INSIDE\n\nThe ferocious wind from Hurricane Ida tore off so much of the roof of Motivatit Seafoods that it rained inside the oyster plant in Houma when squalls from Hurricane Nicholas blew through two weeks later, ruining expensive processing equipment. Across a parking lot, Ida reduced the company's maintenance shop to a crumpled heap of metal.\n\n\"This is at least 20 times worse than we've ever had,\" said Steven Voisin, who runs the 50-year-old family business founded by his late brother and father. \"It could have been worse, but it doesn't matter. The buildings are to the extent of not really being able to be reused.\"\n\nOyster production already was down in Louisiana because of hurricanes and the BP oil spill of 2010, and several years of bad flooding virtually wiped out some areas where the shellfish grew, partly because a major spillway had to be opened in 2019, Voisin said.\n\n\"Where this state was out-producing all other states combined in the past, now we're just another state with a few oysters,\" he said."}

Conviction on each count can bring a sentence of three years in prison plus three years of supervision. Kenosha County Circuit Judge Bruce Schroeder entered a not guilty plea on Black's behalf.\n\nThe hearing had been delayed after Black switched lawyers and hired well-known Waukesha criminal defense attorney Anthony Cotton.\n\nOn Tuesday, Cotton filed a motion to dismiss the charges, which he says rely on \"misreading of the plain language\" of the law regarding minors with guns.\n\nBlack purchased the Smith & Wesson M&P 15 rifle for Rittenhouse — who was 17 at the time — last May at a hardware store near Black's family's property in Rusk County. Rittenhouse has said he used $1,200 in enhanced unemployment pay after his lifeguarding job was ended during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThey used the gun to shoot on private, rural land and it was being kept by Black's stepfather in Kenosha until the night of Aug. 25, when Black and Rittenhouse armed themselves before going downtown. They have said they were asked to protect a car business that had been vandalized and burned during the previous two nights of unrest in the wake of a police shooting of Jacob Blake.\n\nThat night, Rittenhouse fatally shot Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and wounded Gaige Grosskreutz, 27. Rittenhouse was charged with homicides and other counts and has pleaded not guilty. His lawyers say the shootings were in self-defense. His trial is set for Nov. 1.\n\nWisconsin law makes it a felony for anyone who gives a firearm to someone under 18, and a more serious felony if the minor shoots and kills someone.\n\nThere are two exceptions to the first transfer prohibition — it's legal to give a minor a gun if it's used for supervised training in gun safety or supervised target practice, and it's legal if a member of the military or National Guard gives a minor a gun in the line of duty.\n\nCotton argues that there's also a requirement to trigger the general ban on minors with guns — that they must be in violation of rules for young hunters. One law applies to how and when children under 16 may possess firearms while hunting. Another requires young hunters to obtain a hunter safety education certificate.\n\nThe first could not apply because Rittenhouse was 17, Cotton argues, and the second doesn't apply because Rittenhouse wasn't hunting, and therefore wasn't in violation of doing so without a safety education certification.\n\nIn a separate motion, Cotton argues that prosecutors can't charge Black with two counts for the same transfer just because two people were killed. It violates constitutional guarantees of due process and against double jeopardy, the motion states.\n\nHe notes that, under the state's theory, if Rittenhouse had used the gun over a year and killed 12 people, Black could face 12 counts of providing the gun.\n\n\"This absurd conclusion is not supported by a common sense reading of the plain language of the statute, nor by its legislative intent,\" he wrote.\n\nThe motion says prosecutors have the burden of showing the Legislature indeed meant to provide cumulative punishments to the person whose single transfer of a firearm led to multiple deaths.\n\nSchroeder indicated he seemed to agree that the charges \"have a multiplicity problem,\" noting the two counts are identical and don't even identify the two victims."}

Andrew Cuomo, D., drags down the family name with multiple scandals and bipartisan calls for his resignation.\n\n\"Cuomo Prime Time\" had its smallest average audience last week since the coronavirus pandemic started to dominate the news cycle across the United States. CNN's viewership decline comes as Cuomo's big brother has been accused of sexual harassment by multiple women, threatening to \"ruin\" a female reporter, and covering up coronavirus nursing home deaths in the state.\n\nTIMELINE OF CUOMO SCANDALS REVEALS CNN'S INVOLVEMENT IN PUSHING GLOWING NARRATIVE OF EMBATTLED GOVERNOR\n\nCNN's \"Cuomo Prime Time\" averaged 1.31 million viewers during the week of March 15, the show's smallest total since it averaged 1.3 million viewers during the week of March 2, 2020 – days before coronavirus rocked America as the NBA shut down, actor Tom Hanks tested positive for the virus, and then-President Donald Trump addressed the nation about the virus from the Oval Office.\n\n\"Cuomo Prime Time\" finished 2020 with a yearly average of 1.8 million viewers, making it CNN's most-watched program. However, the left-wing CNN show has dropped roughly half a million nightly viewers since then.\n\n\"Cuomo Prime Time\" also struggled among the key demographic of adults age 25-to-54, averaging only 307,000 viewers for its worst performance since the week of Feb. 24, 2020 among the group most coveted by advertisers.\n\nCuomo's downfall could be impacting other CNN programs, too, as the liberal network failed to surpass Fox News among total viewers during any specific hour of the day from 6 a.m. through midnight last Monday through Friday.\n\nCUOMO BROTHERS CONTINUE TO EMBARRASS CNN AS NETWORK'S MOST-WATCHED HOST CAN'T COVER GOVERNOR'S SCANDALS\n\nFor the week, Fox News doubled CNN's primetime viewership and had a double-digit percent advantage over CNN among total day viewers. As a result, CNN finished with its lowest rated weekday audience among both total day and primetime viewers since the week of Feb. 24, 2020.\n\nLast year, CNN famously allowed the Cuomo siblings to conduct a series of widely mocked family reunions billed as interviews while largely ignoring New York's nursing home crisis. CNN announced last month that Chris Cuomo would no longer be allowed to cover his troubled brother, whom he adoringly referred to as the \"Love Guv.\" The network claimed the rule had been in place since 2013 but an \"exception\" was made during the early months of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe public relations nightmare has not been good for CNN's viewership, as its 9 p.m. host is essentially banned from covering a crucial story.\n\nThe \"Cuomo Prime Time\" namesake isn't the only CNN employee with ties to the governor.\n\nCNN executive vice president and chief marketing officer Allison Gollust was Cuomo's communications director before joining the cable news network.\n\nThe governor has made it clear he doesn't plan on stepping down.\n\n\"I am not going to resign, I was not elected by the politicians, I was elected by the people,\" he said on March 12."}

But Ida also encountered natural barriers like wetlands that act as a \"speed bump\" and blunt the impact of storms.\n\nAlthough natural defenses have their limits — especially with major events like Ida — experts say they can play an important part in protecting communities and the environment when storms strike.\n\n\"There is always a benefit by having these wetlands between you and the storm,\" said Gerald Galloway, a recently retired University of Maryland engineering professor who previously worked for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nSince the devastation of hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, a key part of Louisiana's efforts to bulk up its storm defenses has been restoring the wetlands and barrier islands the state has been losing for decades along its coast.\n\nHOW DOES NATURAL TERRAIN PROTECT AGAINST STORMS?\n\nWetlands and other natural terrain can act as buffers for wind and water, giving storm surges more to overcome before they reach people and buildings.\n\n\"They help with storm protection because they are dissipating energy,\" said Hugh J. Roberts, chief operating officer at the Water Institute of the Gulf, an environmental research group.\n\nRoberts compared it to a cyclist riding over rocky debris. Sparse wetlands are like riding over a few pebbles, he said — hardly noticeable. But robust wetlands with elevated terrains are like trying to ride over a long, bumpier stretch of gravel.\n\nThe Water Institute has received funding from the Walton Family Foundation, which also supports The Associated Press' coverage of water and environmental policy.\n\nWHAT ABOUT BIG STORMS LIKE IDA?\n\nWetlands are generally more effective at lessening the impact of small to moderate surges of ocean water, said Ed Link, a researcher at the University of Maryland who previously directed an analysis of New Orleans' storm protections after Katrina.\n\nWith bigger storms like Ida, the effect may be more muted. Once wetlands are full of water, they lose their ability to slow down waves and the storm can travel over them, Link said."}

The sheriff also said that there were \"no signs of impairment,\" and that Woods would receive no citations for the accident.\n\nEarlier this year, in his first interview since the accident, Woods told Golf Digest that he was focused on being able to begin moving on his own again with the help of physical therapy.\n\n\"I do my routines every day and am focused on my No. 1 goal right now: walking on my own.

Brent Blue, a coroner in the case, had just ruled that Petito was strangled three to four weeks before her body was recovered—a finding, Cuomo said, that suggested a \"crime of passion\" and made it \"more important than ever\" that police find Brian Laundrie, Petito's fiancé, who is a person of interest in the case and currently unaccounted for. Cuomo invited a lawyer and a pathologist to discuss the case; he asked the latter how, exactly, a person dies by strangulation and how long it typically takes, and the former about the prospects for Laundrie's arrest. \"Prosecutors have to make the case, every time out, beyond a reasonable doubt,\" Cuomo concluded. \"This isn't about canceling somebody.

However, you won't find a $2,000 stimulus check in any of these forms because Congress didn't approve a $2,000 stimulus check. Or did they?\n\nBoth before and after the U.S. Senate runoff elections in Georgia in January, Democrats touted $2,000 stimulus checks.

Former First Lady Laura Bush's ladified jacket danced on the line between lilac and powder blue, and Senator Amy Klobuchar channeled the hue with her scarf. Even outgoing Vice President Mike Pence's tie, typically ruby red, appeared to be plucked from the burgundy region of Pantone's purple family.\n\nThe color purple is rich with symbolism. It's the color of royalty, and as Gwendolyn Dubois Shaw, senior historian of the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery, points out, \"Our democracy came out of a monarchy and colonial situation. We've never had our own royalty so we tend to project that desire.\"\n\nIt's the color of the Purple Heart, the badge of honor and bravery bestowed by the United States military on veterans wounded or killed in the line of duty. It's the title of Alice Walker's 1982 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about the plight of African American women in the South, a parallel with meaning not lost on the occasion of the swearing in of Harris, the first woman, the first Black and South Asian American to the office of Vice President.\n\nBut today the color purple was also as simple as 1, 2, 3.

Powell could silence a room just by clearing his throat—and he would present the judicious view in every cabinet meeting.\n\nIn the beginning, Secretary of State Colin Powell was expected to be the star of the George W. Bush administration. Judging from polls, the former Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman and victorious Gulf War strategist was more popular than Bush, and he might have been president himself. Powell could silence a room just by clearing his throat—and he would present the judicious view in every cabinet meeting.\n\nPowell, who died Monday at age 84, was heir to a treasured tradition of pragmatic internationalism harking back to his hero George C. Marshall, another ex-general who became America's top diplomat; Henry Stimson (secretary of state under Herbert Hoover and secretary of war under Franklin D. Roosevelt); and Dean Acheson, Harry Truman's secretary of state. Powell added his own strategic embellishment to this tradition. A cornerstone of what came to be known as the Powell Doctrine was that the use of U.S. military force should be astringent in the extreme. It should be mobilized only with overwhelming numbers, in situations where victory was near-certain, and where the exit strategy was clear. Powell also believed that the support of U.S. allies was critical.\n\nAs we know, this did not become the view—or the policy—of the Bush administration. Bush went in virtually the opposite direction, unilaterally invading Iraq after 9/11 on concocted evidence (Powell's worst moment in public life was presenting this evidence to the United Nations in 2003) with insufficient planning and no exit strategy in sight. The Powell Doctrine was also absent from 20 years of muddling through in Afghanistan, where there was no sense of what victory would look like.\n\nYet it appears that one of Powell's most enduring legacies will be a renewed embrace of his guiding philosophy. President Joe Biden's decision to withdraw from Afghanistan came because, he complained, the Pentagon could give him no clear strategy for success. In attempting to regain their credibility with their civilian overlords, U.S. military officials will no doubt fall back on Powellian restraint, as a number of commentators have suggested in recent months.\n\n\"We could have avoided the expenditure of over $2 trillion dollars, the loss of the lives of more than 2,300 U.S. servicemen, as well as the tragic and humiliating disaster that is unfolding in Afghanistan if we had applied the Powell Doctrine twenty years ago,\" Richard J. Pierce Jr., a George Washington University scholar, wrote in the Hill in August.\n\nAccording to Seth Jones, a military expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, most of the Powell Doctrine \"appears to be relevant today, including the list of questions that any U.S. policymaker needs to ask before deciding on military action.\" Still, Jones said a revived Powell Doctrine will not be sufficient by itself. \"The rules tell us whether or not to use force, not what happens over the course of a conflict,\" he said."}

Suburban Westchester County reported three deaths.\n\nOfficials said at least five people died in Pennsylvania, including one killed by a falling tree and another who drowned in his car after helping his wife to escape. A Connecticut state police sergeant, Brian Mohl, perished after his cruiser was swept away.

She called two friends who helped her jar it loose.\n\n\"I was obviously scared, but I had to be strong for my son.

Supporters of the provision, meanwhile, argue that the law protects free speech. Trump's attempts to use the executive branch to change how Section 230 is applied to tech companies was called unconstitutional by legal experts, lawmakers and officials at the Federal Communications Commission.\n\nThe Biden administration now confronts many of the same legal questions. But only Congress can amend the law itself, and while US lawmakers may be united in their hostility to Big Tech, Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill remain split on how Section 230 should be updated.\n\nBiden kept the pressure on Facebook on Monday, saying he not satisfied with what the platform is doing to stop the spread of misinformation, but backing off his accusation from last week that it was directly responsible for \"killing people.\" And senior officials are in touch with Facebook behind the scenes as tensions with the platform have escalated.\n\n\"Facebook isn't killing people – these 12 people are out there giving misinformation.

Two years earlier, he helped organize the massive May Day protests against the Vietnam War, and in 1969, he and six men, who would come to be known as the Chicago Seven, were charged with conspiracy and inciting a riot outside the Democratic National Convention. Davis was one of only two defendants to testify during the raucous, highly publicized trial, which featured a parade of colorful characters, including an unhinged judge and the defense witnesses Allen Ginsberg and Timothy Leary.\n\nDavis was known for being even-tempered and a relentless organizer, but he combined his seriousness of purpose with charisma and an infectious optimism.

The new solution — to war, poverty, racism — was spiritual enlightenment. \"I'm really blissed out with a capital 'B,'\" Davis told the crowd. \"We are operating under a new leadership, and it is divine. It's literally going to transform this planet into what we've always hoped and dreamed for.\"\n\nThe \"new leadership\" had an unlikely frontman: a car-obsessed 15-year-old Indian named Guru Maharaj Ji, dubbed the \"perfect master.\" (Writers and activists who struggled to understand his appeal preferred to call him other things, including \"the fat kid\" and \"the paunchy preadolescent mystical magnate.\") Maharaj Ji, who now goes by Prem Rawat, was one of countless gurus who gained popularity in the West at the time; the teenager's organization, called Divine Light Mission, had an estimated 50,000 followers along with hundreds of centers and ashrams across the United States. Acting as both devotee and spokesman, Davis insisted Maharaj Ji would bring peace to the world. \"God is now on this planet,\" he announced during a radio interview.\n\nDavis's message was catnip to Maharaj Ji's followers in Berkeley, who danced and placed Easter lilies next to a picture of the boy on a linen-draped altar. But then came the catcalls. \"We kept you out of jail, we came to Chicago, and now what are you doing to us?\" someone yelled at Davis. \"Kiss my lotus ass,\" another sneered. Activists with \"fury bleeding out of every wound,\" as one writer put it then, hurled tomatoes at their former idol. A homeless man — or prophet, one couldn't be sure — interrupted Davis with cheeky Buddhist riddles."}

He requested anonymity for fear that speaking up would hurt his prospects for future jobs. Rust Movie Productions did not answer emails Friday and Saturday seeking comment.\n\nAt a rehearsal on the film set Thursday at Bonanza Creek Ranch outside Santa Fe, the gun Baldwin used was one of three that a firearms specialist, or \"armorer,\" had set on a cart outside the building where a scene was being rehearsed, according to the court records.\n\nCourt records indicate that an assistant director, Dave Halls, grabbed a prop gun off a cart and handed it to Baldwin, indicating incorrectly that the weapon didn't carry live rounds by yelling \"cold gun.\"\n\nWhen Baldwin pulled the trigger, he unwittingly killed Hutchins and wounded director Joel Souza, who was standing behind her inside a wooden, chapel-like building.\n\nBaldwin, 63, who is known for his roles in \"30 Rock\" and \"The Hunt for Red October\" and his impression of former President Donald Trump on \"Saturday Night Live,\" has described the killing as a \"tragic accident.\" He was a producer of \"Rust.\"\n\nHalls did not immediately return phone and email messages seeking comment.\n\nA 911 call that alerted authorities to the shooting at the Bonanza Creek Ranch outside Santa Fe hints at the panic on the movie set, as detailed in a recording released by the Santa Fe County Regional Emergency Communications Center.\n\n\"We had two people accidentally shot on a movie set by a prop gun, we need help immediately,\" script supervisor Mamie Mitchell told an emergency dispatcher. \"We were rehearsing and it went off, and I ran out, we all ran out.\"\n\nThe dispatcher asked if the gun was loaded with a real bullet.\n\n\"I cannot tell you. We have two injuries,\" Mitchell replied. \"And this (expletive) AD (assistant director) that yelled at me at lunch, asking about revisions....He's supposed to check the guns. He's responsible for what happens on the set.\"\n\nThe Associated Press was unable to contact Hannah Gutierrez, the film's armorer, and several messages sent to production companies affiliated with \"Rust\" did not receive responses Friday.\n\nCourt records say that Halls grabbed the firearm from the cart and brought it inside to the actor, also unaware that it was loaded with live rounds, a detective wrote in a search warrant application.\n\nIt was unclear how many rounds were fired. Gutierrez removed a shell casing from the gun after the shooting, and she turned the weapon over to police when they arrived, the court records say.\n\nReports say accidental gun discharges had previously occurred on set\n\nGuns used in making movies are sometimes real weapons that can fire either bullets or blanks, which are gunpowder charges intended to produce little more than a flash and a bang.\n\nNew Mexico workplace safety investigators are examining if film industry standards for gun safety were followed during production of \"Rust.\" The Los Angeles Times, citing two crew members it did not name, reported that five days before the shooting, Baldwin's stunt double accidentally fired two live rounds after being told the gun didn't have any ammunition."}

Biden said he gave Putin a list of 16 areas – mostly in critical infrastructure - that are \"off limits\" for cyber-attacks.\n\nRansomware has long posed a cybersecurity threat to companies and infrastructure, but experts say the problem has exploded in recent years. Last year was especially egregious, with ransomware victims in the US paying out nearly $350m, according to the global security group the Institute for Security and Technology – a 311% increase over 2019.\n\nThe FBI director, Christopher Wray, highlighted this startling figure at a congressional hearing. \"Ransomware alone, the total volume of amounts paid in ransomware has tripled over the last year,\" Wray said. \"We think the cyber threat is increasing almost exponentially.\"\n\nExperts attribute the surge to a number of factors, but they say one of the most critical has been the shift to remote working during the pandemic.\n\n\"When you are working from home, you are not behind the castle walls any more,\" said John Hammond, a cybersecurity researcher at the security firm Huntress. \"You are working with your own devices, away from the safe perimeter of corporate networks.\"\n\nCriminals have found an increasingly lucrative path in ransomware attacks, in which a hacker breaks into a company or government's network and seizes data or systems, demanding payment for their return. Employees on computers outside the safety of office networks face more risks. Company networks generally only allow trusted devices to connect, reducing the risk of outside actors or malware entering. They also often have stronger protections in place than the average consumer wifi network.\n\n\"The transition that we're seeing to working from home has contributed dramatically to the rise in successful ransomware attacks,\" said Israel Barak, the chief information security officer at the security firm Cybereason. \"There are a lot more open doors to access networks now that employees are working remotely.\"\n\nOne of the most consequential ransomware hacks in recent months, on the Colonial Pipeline – which shut down systems that supply 45% of the eastern United States' fuel – has now been attributed to the breach of a virtual private network, commonly used by remote employees to connect to a company system.\n\nVPNs are the most secure way for employees to connect to a corporate network from home, but they can pose their own risks if they are out of date or do not use multi-factor authentication.\n\nA spokesman for Colonial Pipeline said the VPN that was compromised was an older model and not the VPN that employees were actively using to remotely access the Colonial network.\n\nBut experts say any time employees work offsite using their own networks, risks are involved. There have been a number of documented attacks on companies carried out through VPN access since the pandemic began, including on the Japanese game developer Capcom and a European industrial firm.\n\nIn June 2020, the justice department identified a Russian ransomware group that was deliberately targeting people who work from home during the pandemic to access corporate and government networks.\n\nCorporate and government offices have a number of measures in place meant to keep bad actors out, said Joseph Carson, the chief security scientist at the cloud security firm Thycotic. That includes secure internet routers with unique passwords, firewalls that monitor incoming traffic and keep out threats, and company devices with additional security in place.\n\n\"Most of those protections are pretty much useless when the devices have been moved to the public internet,\" he said.\n\nThough not a ransomware attack, the hack of Twitter in 2020 July was more directly attributed to remote working. Hackers called several Twitter employees claiming to be IT department employees and offered to help connect through the company's virtual private network being used by employees working from home. The 17-year-old hacker behind that heist collected $117,000 in bitcoin from the attack.\n\nSecurity breaches at large have also been on the rise over the past year. The vast majority of IT teams – 82% – experienced an increase in cyber-attacks in 2020, according to a survey from security firm Sophos."}

Howard missed a Super Bowl season but gained so much more\n\nTAMPA — The Achilles rupture required nine months to completely heal. The remedy for his heartbreak took just as long to develop.\n\nBut the timely arrival of his infant daughter may have been the only thing that helped O.J. Howard overcome the most bittersweet year of his life.\n\nNow Howard is learning that he can play football and be a father at the same time, and neither game needs to suffer.\n\nHoward was off to the best start of his career last season with 11 catches for 146 yards and two touchdowns. In fact, he helped spur a 21-point comeback against the Los Angeles Chargers in Week 4 with three receptions for 50 yards, including a touchdown.\n\nBut with 11:05 remaining in that Oct. 4 game and needing a touchdown to take the lead, Howard was the first option for Tom Brady on a slant route. Brady looked Howard's way but saw him stumble, then came back across the field and connected with rookie running back Ke'Shawn Vaughn for the go-ahead touchdown.\n\nHoward tried to walk it off but couldn't.\n\n\"Tom was looking to throw me the ball. He looked at me when I came out of my cut,\" Howard said. \"When I planted to cut on the slant, it felt like someone kicked me. I never fell to the ground. I put my hand on the ground to brace myself, and I never could get the sensation back in my foot. I was like, 'Man, somebody hit me really hard.'\n\n\"And that's when I remembered the Kobe Bryant interview, the Kevin Durant interview when those guys said (an Achilles tear) felt as if someone kicked them.\"\n\nA blessing follows desolation\n\nAt 6-foot-6, 251 pounds, Howard had never really been hurt until he entered the NFL as the 19th overall pick in the 2017 draft by the Bucs. Before the Achilles injury, he had never had surgery of any kind.\n\nAn ankle injury put Howard on injured reserve the final two games of his rookie year. The next season, foot and ankle injuries cost him six games. In 2019, a hamstring strain following the bye cost him two games.\n\nBut with Brady's arrival, Howard recommitted himself to fitness and focus. He was among the first players to join Brady for throwing sessions in the spring at Berkeley Prep, and the two had instant chemistry on and off the field.\n\n\"I always worked hard my whole life, but (2020) was different,\" Howard said. \"We were just locked in, because we were playing with the greatest quarterback ever, so everybody focused on ... trying to be the guy that wasn't going to be the issue. I can't give him a reason for him not to get me the ball. So I dialed in with him, I stayed here before practice and worked with him.\n\n\"We were starting to get a little feel for each other that L.A. (Chargers) game, and then I tore my Achilles. It was disappointing. It's the first time I really shed tears over the game because I literally saw all the work I put in. I know how hard it was. Working out at Berkeley ― all that stuff just went through my mind at one time. And in four games, it was gone through the drain.\"\n\nBut big blessings come in small packages, and Howard was about to discover how cradling something other than a football brings more joy on fall weekends.\n\n\"The good Lord will find a way, and he blessed me with a baby girl,\" Howard said. \"She eased the whole pain.\""}

It was simpler than a tax return. At the same time, the government also launched a media campaign and sent letters to 9 million people to let them know they could qualify for checks.\n\nAt a hearing last fall, IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig estimated that 8 million eligible people still had not used the non-filer portal.\n\nAnd the number of people who are missing checks could be even bigger today, Jacoby said."}

Trump's first impeachment trial, which took place in February 2020, ended in an acquittal of charges that he tried to pressure Ukraine to investigate now-President Joe Biden.\n\nThe second trial's outcome was not a surprise as the bar to convict would have required a significant bipartisan vote at a time when the US is extremely partisan – more deeply polarised politically than it has been in decades.\n\n\"This trial wasn't about choosing country over party, even not that this was about choosing country over Donald Trump and 43 Republican members chose Trump. They chose Trump,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said following the vote.\n\nTrump, for his part, released a statement calling the trial \"yet another phase of the greatest witch hunt in the history of our Country.\"\n\n\"No president has ever gone through anything like it,\" Trump added.\n\nDemocrats had hoped that Republicans, who had experienced the riot first-hand and were deliberating at the scene of the crime, would cause them to put politics aside and vote for conviction.\n\nWhile the vote reflects the deep divisions between Republicans and Democrats, it also magnifies the deep divisions within the GOP between pro-Trump lawmakers and those that feel he should be held accountable.\n\nThe arguments\n\nHouse Democratic impeachment managers framed their argument around the charge that Trump laid the groundwork for violence through his baseless insistence that the presidential election results were fraudulent. They laid out in detail evidence they argued showed he told the mob to come to Washington, DC on January 6, gave them their marching orders and then refrained from calling off the rioters after the violence started.\n\nThe Democrats played graphic videos of rioters storming the Capitol mixed with Trump's remarks he made and tweets he sent throughout. Over the course of two days, Democrats argued that it was plainly obvious that Trump incited the events that transpired on January 6.\n\n\"It's now clear beyond doubt that Trump supported the actions of the mob and so he must be convicted. It's that simple,\" lead House impeachment manager Jamie Raskin said during closing arguments on Saturday.\n\nTrump's defence team argued his speech was not \"incitement\" and was allowable under constitutional free-speech protections.\n\n\"To claim that the president in any way wished, desired or encouraged lawless or violent behaviour is a preposterous and monstrous lie,\" said Michael van der Veen, one of Trump's lawyers, on Friday.\n\nTrump's defence lawyers also argued that the Democrats' presentation was misleading, filled with \"doctored evidence\" and called the trial \"political theatre\" driven by Democrats who have had it out for Trump since he announced his first presidential campaign six years ago.\n\n\"Since my client stepped in, they have been possessed overwhelming zeal to vanquish an independent-minded outsider ... and to shame, demean, silence and demonize his supporters,\" van der Veen said during his closing arguments on Saturday.\n\nSpeedy trial\n\nLawmakers from both parties had hoped for a quick trial, and they received their wish. Five days is the fastest presidential impeachment trial, by far, in US history."}

Meghan, still unused to the palace's rules (and smarting from media criticism), heeds her husband's words as she holds back tears.\n\nAnd while Harry and Meghan's drama was front-and-center in Lifetime's retelling, in real life the new parents were intentionally sidelined in accordance royal protocol.\n\nMeghan \"was not as prominent perhaps as some people might have expected, but there's a pecking order,\" Joe Little, managing editor of Majesty magazine told PEOPLE. \"There was no slight intended, but William being the older, more senior brother would go out [first] with his wife [Kate Middleton].\"\n\nPrince William (Jordan Whalen) and Kate Middleton (Laura Mitchell) with child actors playing Prince Louis, Prince George and Prince Charlotte in Lifetime's Harry & Meghan: Escaping the Palace. Lifetime\n\nA palace source also revealed that the reason for the Sussexes' position stemmed from a more adorable reason: \"There's no one laying this out, telling her where to stand. And there were a lot of kids who everyone would want at the front.\"\n\nMEGHAN'S EMOTIONAL BREAKDOWN\n\nFive months before the June Trooping parade, the Duchess had endured a real-life crisis point that she would wait more than two years to share.\n\nThe Duchess revealed in her Emmy-nominated interview with Winfrey that when she and Harry were scheduled to attend a performance at Royal Albert Hall in January 2019, she finally realized she could not ignore suicidal thoughts she later described as \"real and frightening and constant.\"\n\nReflecting on that night years later, Meghan acknowledged, \"I was ashamed to say it at the time and ashamed to have to admit it to Harry. But I knew that if I didn't say it — then I would do it. I just didn't want to be alive anymore.\"\n\nThough Harry offered to attend the event alone, Meghan told him, \"I can't be left alone.\" So they both put on a brave face and carried out their royal duties.\n\nMeghan told Winfrey that when she looks at the photos from the night, she can see Harry's hand tightly gripped around hers: \"[We were] both just trying to hold on.\" After they took their seats and the lights went down in the hall, she says she began \"weeping.\"\n\n\"And that's I think so important for people to remember is you have no idea what's going on for someone behind closed doors. No idea,\" she said. \"Even the people that smile and shine the brightest lights. You need to have compassion for what it actually potentially going on.\"\n\nAs Lifetime movies tend to do, Escaping the Palace took Meghan's revelations one step farther, visually connecting her suicidal ideations to those that Harry's mother, Princess Diana, had confessed in Diana: Her True Story.\n\nMorton told PEOPLE last week, \"There are some interesting parallels, I think, that we draw between Meghan's experience and some of Princess Diana's experience.\"\n\nTHE SUSSEXES' FINAL ROYAL APPEARANCE\n\nLifetime\n\nEscaping the Palace finds plenty of dramatic tension in the couple's last engagement as working royals before their official exit at the end of March 2020. In a private moment, Meghan shows Harry her dazzling green Emilia Wickstead dress, complete with \"superhero cape,\" for the Commonwealth Day service in March 2020.\n\nOnce they convene with the other royals, the film suggests the Sussexes were excluded from the royal procession as retaliation for their impending departure, creating friction between Harry and William (Jordan Whalen). In the film, Kate (Laura Mitchell) smoothes the situation over, and future king William ultimately offers to also forego the procession to appease Harry."}

But how soon is now?\n\nMillions of Americans are eagerly awaiting their second stimulus checks, which provide $600 for each eligible adult and child. The IRS said last Tuesday that it had started to distribute the checks via direct deposit, a process that will extend into this week.\n\nThe tax agency added that it started mailing paper checks on December 30 to people who don't have their bank account info on file with the IRS. But even so, the timeline leaves many people wondering when exactly the check will land in their accounts — especially as the IRS' website for checking one's payment status is unavailable.\n\nThe second stimulus check follows a rocky rollout this spring for more than 160 million stimulus payments directed by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. That relief effort, which directed $1,200 for each eligible adult and $500 for each eligible child, encountered a number of problems, such as a delay in payment to people who didn't have their bank account information on file with the IRS, as was the case for some Social Security recipients.\n\nThe IRS will use the same method to get the money to people as it did in the first round, said Mark Steber, chief tax information officer at Jackson Hewitt.\n\n\"If taxpayers received a direct deposit then, they will again; if they received a mailed check or debit card then, they will again,\" he said.\n\nBut the IRS' \"Get My Payment\" website is currently offline. The agency said it expects its \"Get My Payment\" tool to be operating again \"in a few days,\" although it didn't specify a date.\n\nThat's a problem, although the site should be up by next week, based on the IRS' statement, Steber noted. \"The updated website should include information on both the first and second stimulus payments,\" he said.\n\nThat website allowed people this spring to provide or update their bank account data to the IRS. It also informed people when their checks would be landing in their accounts. But it, too, had glitches. Some people reported getting error messages such as \"Payment status not available,\" while others got locked out of the site.\n\n\"Payments are automatic\""}

Rodgers was placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list and 2020 first-round pick Jordan Love will start in place of Rodgers.\n\nDespite telling reporters in August he'd \"been immunized,\" Rodgers is not vaccinated against COVID-19, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport and NFL Network's Mike Garafolo reported. Rodgers must spend a mandatory 10 days away from the team, according to the league's COVID-19 protocol, ruling him out for the Packers' Week 9 game against the Chiefs. The earliest Rodgers can rejoin the team is Nov. 13 -- the day before their Week 10 matchup against the Seahawks.\n\nRodgers previously had sought and was denied an exemption from the NFL-NFL Players Association COVID-19 protocols based on his antibody levels this summer, which left his status as unvaccinated, NFL Media reported Wednesday.\n\nRodgers received homeopathic treatment from his personal doctor to raise his antibody levels and asked the NFLPA to review his status. The players' union, the NFL-NFLPA jointly designated infectious disease consultant and the league agreed that Rodgers' treatment did not provide any documented protection from the coronavirus.\n\nAccordingly, Rodgers did not qualify for an exemption, and he remained subject to a variety of restrictions, including daily testing, mask-wearing and high-risk close contact protocol that would force him to isolate for five days based on interaction with a positive individual, even if he tested negative.\n\nIf his antibody levels are high enough, Rodgers could be considered fully vaccinated with just one shot. The NFL-NFLPA regular-season COVID protocols allow for an individual to become fully vaccinated via \"a quantitative antibody test (taken at the club facility and administered by BioReference Laboratory personnel after Aug. 26, 2021 and before the individual has received any dose of a COVID vaccine) demonstrating COVID total antibody levels (IgG, IgA, IgM) to the spike protein of 100 U/mL or greater, and a positive antibody test to the COVID IgG nucleocapsid protein, and 14 days have passed since the individual received one dose of any COVID vaccine (Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer or Moderna).\"\n\nSources, however, told NFL Media that Rodgers has not received one of the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nAfter telling reporters the Packers are \"all hands on deck\" with Rodgers out, coach Matt LaFleur was asked if the QB's August comment may have been misleading, to which he replied, \"It's a great question for Aaron, I'm not going to comment on it,\" per the Green Bay Press-Gazette."}

Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Sen. Amanda F.

She announced Facebook's actions on her personal Facebook page, which was not affected.\n\n\"Make no mistake, the liberal left who controls social media is systematically targeting vocal supporters of President Trump in an all-out, collaborative effort to silence our voices,\" she said in an interview. \"Facebook has weaponized its community standards.\"\n\nSome Trump allies have speculated that antifa was responsible for inciting violence and storming the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. No evidence supports this claim. (Video: The Washington Post)\n\nA spokesman for Facebook did not respond to a request for comment Friday.\n\nThe restrictions on Chase follow a crackdown on Trump by social media companies, who say his posts helped incite the riot. Twitter on Friday night announced it was permanently suspending Trump's account \"due to the risk of further incitement of violence,\" while Facebook announced Thursday it was banning Trump indefinitely.\n\nFacebook has flagged several of Chase's recent posts with the tag: \"False information. Checked by independent fact-checkers.\" That includes one post that claimed, \"Facial recognition firm claims Antifa infiltrated Trump Supporters.\"\n\nTwitter on Jan. 8 banned President Trump from its site, a punishment for his role in inciting violence at the U.S. Capitol.

I was there with the people; I know. Don't believe the fake media narrative,\" Chase had written.\n\nThe state Senate's Democratic Caucus on Friday called on Chase — who last month said Trump should hang on to power by declaring martial law — to resign, accusing her of \"empowering a failed coup d'etat.\"\n\nChase brushed off their criticism, saying Virginia Democrats had \"committed treason\" by loosening restrictions on voting last year by eliminating photo ID requirements, among other things.\n\nThe Senate Republican Caucus, which Chase quit in November 2019, declined to comment.\n\nA suburbanite who got interested in politics as a home-schooling mom and worked for GOP establishment figure Eric Cantor before the tea party movement toppled him in 2014, Chase has been a controversial figure even within her own party. The rift became public in 2019, after she cursed out a Virginia Capitol Police officer over a parking space.\n\nWhile fellow Virginia Republicans have rarely crossed Trump, Chase has gone further than most with inflammatory rhetoric. In mid-December, as her lone rival for the GOP gubernatorial nomination, Del. Kirk Cox (R-Colonial Heights), acknowledged President-elect Joe Biden's win in the electoral college, Chase urged Trump to declare \"martial law\" to prevent his removal from office."}

The issue was not associated with malware, the company said.\n\nThe company had earlier said shippers were having problems entering and updating nominations for deliveries.\n\nThe \"system functionality has returned to normal,\" the company said.\n\nThe reason for the network issues was not immediately clear.\n\nColonial's shipping nomination system is operated by a third party, privately-held Transport4, or T4, which handles similar logistics for other pipeline companies.\n\nT4 on Friday said its application was working for all customers and carriers. It did not comment on Colonial's current network issue and said that data between T4 and Colonial was transacting normally.\n\nFriday's network problems are the second occurrence of such issues since the attack earlier in the month. Colonial is the largest fuel system in the United States, accounting for millions of barrels of daily deliveries to the U.S. East Coast and Southeast.\n\nShortly after Colonial restored operations from the hack, it suffered a brief network outage that prevented customers from planning upcoming shipments on the line. At the time, Colonial said the disruption was caused by efforts by the company to harden its system, and was not the result of a reinfection of its network.\n\nThe southeast United States is still recovering from the six-day line outage from earlier this month and the supply issues it caused in the region. Around 6,000 gas stations were still without fuel this week, according to tracking firm GasBuddy, down from a peak of more than 16,000.\n\nAlmost 40% of gas stations in the capital, Washington, were without supplies on Thursday, GasBuddy said.

Bush's Middle East Wars, Dies of Cancer at 88\n\nDonald Rumsfeld, who served as the country's youngest and then oldest defense secretary and whose decades-long career was ultimately defined by his management of two deeply divisive Middle East wars under President George W. Bush, died Tuesday. He was 88.\n\nRumsfeld's family announced his death in a statement on Wednesday, saying that he was \"was surrounded by family in his beloved Taos, New Mexico.\"\n\nHe died of multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer, a spokesman told USA Today.\n\nA Navy man after college, Rumsfeld went on to represent his home state of Illinois in Congress from 1963 to 1969 before joining the administration of President Richard Nixon in various roles.\n\nAfter Nixon's resignation in the Watergate scandal, Rumsfeld became successor Gerald Ford's chief of staff and then secretary of defense — a position he resumed 24 years later under President Bush, where he worked with longtime friend Dick Cheney, Bush's vice president.\n\nRumsfeld's second stint as defense secretary lasted from 2001 to 2006, during which time he became the face of the administration's post-9/11 military conflicts as they ballooned in cost and death toll, without end, while the public increasingly turned against the incursions that the White House said were needed to ensure international security. (Rumsfeld continued to argue the same, years later.)\n\nDescribed alternately as garrulous and even technocratic, with a focus on how to modernize inside the sprawl of the military, Rumsfeld had a penchant for \"snowflakes\" — numerous memos on all manner of topics, big and small. (\"I don't want them to use initials that I don't understand. ... I have to ask questions about every third piece of paper I receive,\" he wrote in 2001.)\n\nAfter leaving the Bush White House, Rusmfeld released a memoir in 2011 and sat for extensive interviews for a 2014 documentary. In 2016, he helped develop a phone-based card game app.\n\nHe also started an eponymous foundation with his wife, Joyce, focused on \"encouraging leadership, public service and free political and economic systems.\"\n\nMuch of Rumsfeld's public profile in his final years was shaped by his time at the Pentagon under Bush:\n\nWhat did he make of the decisions to go to war? Of the American military's strategy and struggles in Afghanistan and Iraq? Of the administration's faulty search for weapons of mass destruction? Of the notorious reports of detainee torture and of abuses at the military prison Abu Ghraib?\n\nWas there more he would like to say?\n\nThe Rumsfeld family's statement said Wednesday that \"history may remember him for his extraordinary accomplishments over six decades of public service, but for those who knew him best and whose lives were forever changed as a result, we will remember his unwavering love for his wife Joyce, his family and friends and the integrity he brought to a life dedicated to country.\"\n\nRumsfeld, for his part, had not wavered in his work.\n\nHe wrote in his memoir: \"Knowing what we later learned and recognizing the costs, there is not a persuasive argument to be made that the United States would be in a stronger strategic position or that Iraq and the Middle East would be better off if Saddam [Hussein, the Iraqi dictator] were still in power. In short, ridding the region of Saddam's brutal regime has created a more stable and secure world.\"\n\nIn his own statement on Wednesday, President Bush, 74, described Rumsfeld as purpose-driven and big-hearted, recounting how he went to the Pentagon on Sept. 11, 2001, in the immediate aftermath of the attack to help the survivors.\n\n\"For the next five years, he was in steady service as a wartime secretary of defense — a duty he carried out with strength, skill, and honor,\" Bush said.\n\nOf Rumsfeld, Bush said, \"He never paled before tough decisions, and never flinched from responsibility.\"\n\nThe documentarian Errol Morris, who spoke with Rumsfeld for some 33 hours for 2014's The Unknown Known, took an opposing view and found him not even indecipherable.\n\n\"I've made a whole number of movies over the years about characters that seem to be completely unaware of themselves. I suppose in English the word that we often use is 'clueless,' \" Morris told reporters at the time. \"That's the central feeling I'm left with at the end of making this movie.\""}

Minutes later, deputies say, another call came in through 911 where a person stated that he was a staff member at Dakota High School and that there was a shooter in the building. The man reportedly told dispatch that a shooter had fired shots outside of his classroom, and then gave his classroom number and personal information, which were later determined to be false.\n\n\"This incident was taken as the highest priority and both the first responders and the school took swift actions to ensure the students and staff safety.

I want the community to be assured that we will continue to train and work with our schools to ensure safety for all,\" said Macomb County Sheriff Anthony Wickersham in a press release.\n\nThe sheriff's office said the false call was treated as an active shooter incident with deputies, EMS and fire responding, but no evidence of any type of shooting was found.\n\nAn initial investigation revealed that a student had set up the calls by paying someone on the \"dark web\" to make the threats. The juvenile student is expected to be arraigned on one count of False Threat of Terrorism at a later date. The investigation is ongoing.\n\n\"The safety and security of our students and staff is our top priority.

The choice of who does what is no accident.\n\nWhile Derek Chauvin 's attorney, Eric Nelson, works alone, the prosecution is being handled by two assistant attorneys general, Matthew Frank and Erin Eldridge, and two outside lawyers, Jerry Blackwell and Steve Schleicher. Ten more are working behind the scenes, many for free.\n\nExperts agree the roles played by prosecutors are based on the skill sets each brings, but appearances matter, too.\n\nWHY DID BLACKWELL GIVE THE OPENING STATEMENT?\n\nThe undercurrent of racial tension — a white police officer accused of killing a Black man — can't be ignored. Blackwell is a prominent Black civil rights attorney and one of the founders of the Minnesota Association of Black Lawyers. Last year, he won a posthumous pardon for a Black man wrongly convicted of rape before the infamous Duluth lynchings of 1920.\n\nBut law professors following the case said it's Blackwell's unique ability to translate complicated legal jargon into information jurors can understand that made him the obvious pick to lay out the prosecution's case.\n\n\"One of the things he's known for is his ability to speak English rather than 'legalese,'\" said Joseph Daly, emeritus professor at Mitchell Hamline School of Law in St. Paul, Minnesota. \"It's extremely important in this case just to try to explain what the elements of the crimes are that Mr. Chauvin is charged with.\"\n\nASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIN ELDRIDGE QUESTIONED TWO OF THE YOUNGEST WITNESSES.

Before that, she served as a special assistant U.S. attorney in Nebraska and the Northern District of Iowa.\n\nJonathan Simon, a professor at University of California Berkeley School of Law, noted that our culture associates women with \"being more caretaking toward children, toward juveniles.\"\n\nUsing Eldridge as the questioner may help to \"ease the witnesses' experience and get their testimony as effectively as possible, but also to help the jury see this in the most sympathetic light,\" Simon said.\n\nDaly said Eldridge \"was particularly adept at showing empathy and kindness and a certain softness, which I think is really important when you're questioning children.\"\n\nWhen an 18-year-old witness, Alyssa Funari, began to cry, Eldridge told her to take her time and offered a tissue.\n\n\"Is this difficult for you to talk about?\" Eldridge asked. \"Do you need a minute?\"\n\nIS THERE A DRAWBACK TO USING SO MANY DIFFERENT PROSECUTORS?\n\nSt. Louis University School of Law professor Sue McGraugh said she sought to make a personal connection with jurors when she was a prosecutor. She said she's rarely seen a case with so many prosecutors, and that it carries some risk.\n\n\"It's unusual because, as someone who has tried a lot of cases, you do want the jury to form some sort of attachment to someone on the legal team,\" McGraugh said.\n\nSO, WHY SO MANY?\n\nIt's evidence of the stakes in the trial that Daly called \"possibly one of the most important cases ever in the United States and possibly the world.\"\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz appointed Attorney General Keith Ellison to handle the prosecution just days after Floyd's death, and Ellison vowed to utilize whatever resources were necessary.\n\nFrank and Schleicher have handled the lion's share of questioning since the trial began. Frank is a 21-year veteran of the attorney general's office and has led the criminal division for 14 years.

But they usually fail to bring it to the authorities' attention. So the credit truly goes to those two students that stepped up, came forward and brought this to our attention.\"\n\nHagins was apparently in danger of failing classes and was cited for a traffic citation a day before the arrest, police said.

He may want to claim it was all a joke and he wasn't serious about it, but we don't find anything funny about discussing a mass shooting on campus.\"\n\nTwo students reported the Snapchat messages to campus police, who called the Daytona Beach Police Department.

Several members of the new interim government were previously detained at Guantánamo Bay and were released in exchange for U.S. soldier Bowe Bergdahl in 2014.\n\nOn Wednesday, Taliban forces cracked down on a protest in Kabul, detaining several Afghan journalists and severely beating two who work for Etilaatroz, an Afghan newspaper, the outlet said on Twitter. Photos shared on social media showed their backs covered with lash marks.\n\nThe Interior Ministry later announced a ban on protests, saying participants have been \"harassing people and disrupting normal life.\"\n\n\"All citizens are informed that for the time being, they should not try to hold demonstrations under any name or title,\" the statement said.\n\n\"For the past few days, a number of people in Kabul and other provinces have taken to the streets in the name of demonstrations, disrupting security, harassing people and disrupting normal life,\" it added.\n\nThe international community is still grappling with how to manage the Taliban takeover.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters Thursday that Washington is closely monitoring whether al-Qaeda militants will once again attempt to use Afghanistan as a staging ground to launch attacks against the United States."}

Ted Cruz said his family vacation to Mexico was \"obviously a mistake\" as he returned stateside Thursday following an uproar over his disappearance during a deadly winter storm.\n\nThe Republican senator said he began second-guessing the trip since the moment he first got on the plane Wednesday. \"In hindsight, I wouldn't have done it,\" he told reporters.\n\nThe Associated Press and other media outlets reported that he had traveled out of the country with his family as hundreds of thousands of Texans were still grappling with the fallout of a winter storm that crippled the state's power grid. The trip drew criticism from leaders in both parties and was seen as potentially damaging to his future political ambitions.\n\nCruz said in an earlier statement Thursday that he accompanied his family to Cancun a day earlier after his daughters asked to go on a trip with friends, given that school was canceled for the week.\n\n\"Wanting to be a good dad, I flew down with them last night and am flying back this afternoon,\" Cruz wrote.\n\n\"My staff and I are in constant communication with state and local leaders to get to the bottom of what happened in Texas,\" he continued. \"We want our power back, our water on, and our homes warm.\"\n\nCruz told reporters Thursday night that he returned to the U.S. because he realized he needed to be in Texas. He said he had originally been scheduled to stay in Mexico through the weekend.\n\n\"I didn't want all the screaming and yelling about this trip to distract even one moment from the real issues that I think Texans care about, which is keeping all of our families safe,\" Cruz said.\n\n\"It was obviously a mistake, and in hindsight, I wouldn't have done it,\" he said.\n\nThe fierce political backlash comes as Cruz eyes a second presidential run in 2024. He was already one of the most villainized Republicans in Congress, having created adversaries across the political spectrum in a career defined by far-right policies and fights with the establishment.\n\nMore recently, he emerged as a leader in former President Donald Trump's push to overturn the results of the November election. Billboards calling for his resignation stood along Texas highways earlier in the month.\n\nEven the state Republican Party chair declined to come to Cruz's defense on Thursday.\n\n\"That's something that he has to answer to his constituents about,\" Texas GOP Chair Allen West said when asked whether Cruz's travel was appropriate while Texans are without power and water.\n\n\"I'm here trying to take care of my family and look after my friends and others that are still without power,\" West said. \"That's my focus.\"\n\nHundreds of thousands of people in Texas woke up Thursday to a fourth day without power, and a water crisis was unfolding after winter storms wreaked havoc on the state's power grid and utilities.\n\nTexas officials ordered 7 million people — one-quarter of the population of the nation's second-largest state — to boil tap water before drinking the water, after days of record low temperatures that damaged infrastructure and froze pipes.\n\nIn Austin, some hospitals faced a loss in water pressure and, in some cases, heat.\n\nNews of Cruz's absence quickly rippled across the state.\n\nLivia Trevino, a 24-year-old whose Austin home was still without water Thursday, said she felt abandoned by government leaders.\n\n\"They are taking vacations and leaving the country, so they don't have to deal with this, and we are freezing to death. We don't have water and we don't have food,\" she said.\n\nIn his statement, Cruz said that his family had lost heat and power as well.\n\n\"This has been an infuriating week for Texans,\" he said.\n\nWhile the situation will not help Cruz's political future, the two-term senator is not in any immediate political danger. His current term expires in early 2025, and the unofficial beginning of the next Republican presidential primary election is two years away.\n\nStill, Democrats across Washington were eager to talk about the controversy.\n\nOne of Cruz's most aggressive critics on the left, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, encouraged her supporters on Thursday to volunteer for a \"welfare check phone bank\" to help Texans affected by the storm.\n\n\"So many elected leaders in Texas have failed their constituents,\" the New York Democrat wrote in an email. \"Instead of focusing on relief, they've chosen to go on Fox News to spread lies or to board a plane to Cancun.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, White House press secretary Jen Psaki leaned into a question about Cruz's \"whereabouts.\"\n\n\"I don't have any updates on the exact location of Sen. Ted Cruz nor does anyone at the White House,\" Psaki said, adding that President Joe Biden's administration is focused on \"working directly with leadership in Texas and surrounding states on addressing the winter storm and the crisis at hand.\"\n\nCruz's office declined to answer specific questions about the family vacation, but his staff reached out to the Houston Police Department on Wednesday afternoon to say the senator would be arriving at the airport, according to department spokesperson Jodi Silva. She said officers \"monitored his movements\" while Cruz was at the airport.\n\nSilva could not say whether such requests are typical for Cruz's travel or whether his staff had made a similar request for his return flight.\n\nU.S. Capitol Police officials and the Senate sergeant-at-arms have encouraged lawmakers and their staff to be conscious of potential threats and to consider advising law enforcement about their travel at airports and other transportation hubs.\n\nCruz's office did not immediately say whether the senator would self-quarantine. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises people who have traveled during the pandemic to get a coronavirus test three to five days after their return and to quarantine for a full week, regardless of the test results.\n\nCruz checked in for his return flight Thursday afternoon in Cancun and walked briskly through the terminal pulling a roller bag to security. He wore a golf shirt, jeans and a face mask in the style of the Texas state flag.\n\nThe senator was accompanied by a Spanish-speaking man wearing a black polo shirt with the name and logo of The Ritz-Carlton hotel chain.\n\nCruz told reporters that he planned to \"go home and keep working to get the grid reopened, to get power restored, to get the water back on.\""}

The report found the freezing accounted for 44% of the issues, followed by natural gas fuel shortage issues, which accounted for 31% of the unplanned outages.\n\nThe findings show that most natural gas production and processing facilities at Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) \"were not identified as critical load or otherwise protected from load shedding\" and ultimately led to a decline in natural gas production and supply.\n\nThe federal agency offered 28 recommendations, most of which should occur within the next two to three years.\n\nThe recommendations include winterizing equipment and conducting annual training on winterization plans. Generator owners who experience outages or failures due to freezing should review what occurred and implement corrective action plans.\n\nA similar report with recommendations was released after the blackouts in 2011. Most power providers did not act on them. A decade later, experts say the recommendations need to be taken seriously.\n\n\"We need to listen this time. This report that they issued this week looked so much like the report they issued in 2011 when we had what's known as the 'Super Bowl freeze.' FERC and NERC issued a report and they found the exact same shortcomings. That we didn't listen last time. We didn't winterize our natural gas systems. We didn't winterize our power plants. I am hopeful the legislature and the Texas regulators are doing more this time than last, but I still don't think they're doing enough,\" explained Daniel Cohan, an associate professor of environmental engineering at Rice University.\n\nThe Texas power grid is a large and complex system, so how does it eventually get fixed?\n\n\"You are starting to see this with the FERC/NERC report. They are starting to address the fact that we are going to have to make it economically advantageous for the electricity producers and the energy producers across the state of Texas to make money when they are up,\" explained Ramanan Krishnamoorti, Chief Energy Officer at the University of Houston.\n\nABC13 reached out to ERCOT about FERC's preliminary findings and they responded with the following statement:"}

The industry needs to gain greater visibility across a vast network of operational technology, or OT, and to establish next-generation information-sharing platforms, according to experts.\n\nImproving visibility into OT — the hardware and software that control infrastructure — would allow pipeline operators to respond to cyber breaches with greater precision, reducing the potential for costly supply disruptions across the nation's 2.6 million miles of oil and gas pipelines. It would also improve operators' ability to detect malicious activity and prevent an intruder from triggering a catastrophic incident.\n\nComplicating the task are legacy OT networks that defy cheap and easy fixes, as well as long-standing tension between public and private stakeholders over minimum cybersecurity requirements and the scope of information that operators should share with government.\n\nCybersecurity vulnerabilities exposed by the May attack on Colonial Pipeline Co. have spurred a new push for regulation. Industry observers, including Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman Richard Glick, have long criticized the lack of minimum standards for certain cybersecurity protections. With the Colonial attack in recent memory, though, the industry and some cybersecurity experts worry that in policymakers' rush to regulate, they could impose ineffective, burdensome rules.\n\n\"Compliance does not equate to security,\" Kimberly Denbow, managing director of security and operations at the American Gas Association, said in an interview, echoing cybersecurity experts.\n\nLong impasse over regulation ends\n\nBoth Kinder Morgan Inc. and TC Energy Corp. noted their implementation of the cybersecurity framework released by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, as part of their defenses against cyberattacks. Kinder Morgan expressed confidence in its cyber incident response plan, noting that there have been no interruptions or suspensions of the company's systems due to a cyber event. Still, the operators see room for additional government involvement in the space.\n\n\"Based on our implementation of the NIST cybersecurity framework and the partnerships we have with various relevant government agencies, we would not oppose making compliance with the NIST [framework] mandatory,\" Kinder Morgan spokesperson Melissa Ruiz said. \"However, we also believe that it is part of the federal government's primary constitutional purpose to protect citizens and businesses from cyberattacks by entities affiliated with or sponsored by foreign governments.

For one to say something after last week's event would be noteworthy and rare enough. For all eight Joint Chiefs to speak out together — in a \"message to the Joint Force,\" no less — shows just how perilous they deem this moment to be.\n\n\"The violent riot in Washington, D.C. on January 6, 2021 was a direct assault on the U.S. Congress the Capitol building, and our Constitutional process,\" the letter signed by all the Joint Chiefs reads. \"We witnessed actions inside the Capitol building that were inconsistent with the rule of law. The rights of freedom of speech and assembly do not give anyone the right to resort to violence, sedition and insurrection.\"\n\nWhile that may be a general statement about the insurrection meant more for the public, the next section was clearly meant for the troops they help lead.\n\n\"As Service Members, we must embody the values and ideals of the Nation. We support and defend the Constitution,\" they wrote. \"Any act to disrupt the Constitutional process is not only against our traditions, values, and oath; it is against the law.\"\n\n\"President-elect Joe Biden,\" they concluded, \"will be inaugurated and will become our 46th Commander in Chief.\"\n\nThere are likely two main reasons why Joint Chiefs Chair Army Gen. Mark Milley and the seven others felt the need to pen the letter.\n\nFirst, veterans and possibly even some active-duty troops were allegedly involved in the attack on the Capitol last week. That means the military community certainly contains people who wrongly believe the presidential election was stolen, subscribe to the QAnon conspiracy theory, or have far-right tendencies.\n\nRegardless of their passions or views, military leaders aim to keep the armed services as apolitical as possible. Otherwise, some might associate the military with one party or another, and that isn't healthy for a democracy.\n\nSecond, the Joint Chiefs tend to speak out when something really egregious has happened, and there's no question the Capitol insurrection fits the bill. \"[T]hey have developed a finely tuned 'political' (small p) radar on when to weigh in,\" CNN Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr tweeted on Tuesday.\n\nFor example, after President Donald Trump said some attendees at the 2017 far-right rally in Charlottesville were \"very fine people,\" all the Joint Chiefs spoke out against racism and bigotry. \"The Army doesn't tolerate racism, extremism, or hatred in our ranks. It's against our Values and everything we've stood for since 1775,\" Milley, who was chief of staff of the Army then, said at the time.\n\nBased on this letter, it looks as though America's top military officials won't tolerate another thing: the attempted overthrow of American democracy by force."}

While New Orleans dealt with flooding and a nearly two-week power outage, many residents in Jean Lafitte lost everything.\n\n\"A big portion of Lafitte became homeless overnight,\" said Kerner who told CNN the town was placed in a vulnerable position years earlier following Hurricane Katrina \"when the federal government decided to build levees around the entire region besides our area.\"\n\n\"The decision to build levees all around us leaves all the water to fill up here.\"\n\nHurricane Ida brought a little of everything to the town.\n\n\"We had the water, we had the wind. So people had significant water damage. Not only that, you had 4 feet of mud in people's homes,\" Kerner explained.\n\nThe town, which sits on the Mississippi River Delta, did have a state-run ring levee system built around it, but it wasn't enough for Hurricane Ida.\n\nMany residents like Benny Alexie bore the brunt of the storm. Alexie's home was washed onto the nearby highway.\n\n\"It took me 40 years to get where I was,\" said Alexie. \"It only took a matter of hours to lose it all.\"\n\n\"What this community has endured has been just so unjust,\" explained Kerner.\n\n\"Our most vulnerable people are priced out of insurance and don't qualify for FEMA.\"\n\nSome residents didn't qualify for FEMA assistance due to lack of proof of occupancy because of informal inheritance of homes; others had paid insurance claims that were insufficient to repair and protect their homes long-term.\n\nKerner said that although there's been some progress in the last few months, recovery for so many Jean Lafitte citizens could take years.\n\n\"They need funds; they need people to come to help build the homes and put their roofs back together.\"\n\nHabitat for Humanity dedicated to long-term recovery\n\nHabitat for Humanity has been on the ground since the hurricane struck, distributing tarps and other supplies to help the community protect what remains of their homes from further damage.\n\n\"That's not where habitat really shines,\" said Marguerite Oestreicher, executive director of the New Orleans Area Habitat for Humanity.\n\n\"It's long-term recovery and helping people figure out a path to rebuilding.\"\n\nOestreicher said Jean Lafitte is the type of community where neighbors are helping neighbors in their time of need.\n\n\"Right now, everyone is hurting, and the amount of work to be done is just overwhelming.\"\n\nThis is why volunteers are essential.\n\n\"Those are the extra hands,\" Oestreicher explained. \"Those are the people who can come in; they can muck and gut, and they don't have to be skilled carpenters in order to be helpful.\"\n\nNew Orleans Area Habitat for Humanity recently reopened its doors to new volunteers. Since the coronavirus pandemic, only core or long-time volunteers like Dennis Kehoe have been on work sites. Kehoe has volunteered with the nonprofit since 1991.

Three employees using poorly designed software accidentally sent $900 million to one of its client's creditors instead of $7.8 million — then when creditors refused to return most of the money, a judge ruled in favor of the creditors.\n\nThe judge blamed \"human error\" in his decision, pointing out that:\n\nThe instruction manual for the banking software, Flexcube, explained how to perform this kind of transaction.\n\nCiti uses a \"six eyes process\" — meaning that three Citi employees reviewed Flexcube's transfer screen, to approve the transaction.\n\nFlexcube warned that funds would be sent out of the bank, but not the amount.\n\nHowever, that explanation misses the bigger picture: If three experienced employees agree on what they expect the software will do, but it does something else, that indicates an interaction design defect that caused the human error.\n\nAvoiding mistakes is one of the six ways better employee user experience (UX) drives better business results. It's rarely as dramatic as a single $500 million incident — at most companies, it's a steady drumbeat of avoidable mistakes that cost time and money and could have been prevented through better UX design. This is a design debt interest payment that almost every business is paying day after day, year after year.\n\nThe Design For Work Opportunity\n\nBusinesses are waking up to the upside opportunity in improving UX design for employees. Already, about half of design teams work on employee-facing software. And based on Forrester's analysis of the $150 billion-plus design industry, that number is going to grow.\n\nCiti has many dedicated professionals working on UX for its consumer app and site, both of which are much better designed than that screen in Flexcube, based on Forrester's UX reviews of apps and sites for banking customers. Citi probably even has a team dedicated to employee-facing software as most large firms do. However, that team is probably overstretched and wishes they'd had the chance to improve this interaction in Flexcube. If you were Citi, wouldn't you invest in fixing that defect right now? How many other UX issues lurk inside of businesses waiting to cause major or minor mistakes? And how many other companies are in the same boat? Again, this is interest paid on Citi's design debt — and it's likely to come due again.\n\nIt's not just internal teams either — software vendors are being forced to improve UX or face dire consequences. How would you like to be Flexcube right now, knowing that your product caused a customer to lose $500M, and that your competitors are telling all your prospects about it? And consider just how much frustrating software employees interact with every day. Every single one of the vendors of those tools is at risk of being abandoned in favor of a better designed replacement. Just look at commerce suites, for one example among many.\n\nThere have been plenty of major mistakes caused by bad UX before, of course: The tragic accident of the USS John McCain in 2017 that was caused by confusing controls; the Hawaii nuclear missile test warning gone awry in 2018; Three Mile Island's 1979 meltdown exacerbated by a convoluted control room. And there are minor ones every day that affect us. These issues are everywhere and at every scale.\n\nMaking It Better Requires Effort And Expertise — And Pays Off\n\nSo what's the first step to improving this situation? Recognizing there's a problem: Our research has found that most organizations assume employees will use whatever tool they're asked to, so most companies put minimal effort into design as long as the functionality exists, even if it's unnecessarily convoluted and obscure. They may have been able to get away with that in the past — but less and less so, now."}

And according to Brady, such an outcome never even crossed his mind.\n\n\"First of all, I was not thinking at that moment. It was not a thought. It was, 'This seems really fun to do,'\" Brady told James Corden during an appearance on The Late Late Show. \"Not to mention, when you get your hands on one of those trophies, there's a lot of really sharp edges on the bottom. ...

I'm so happy that (tight end) Cam (Brate caught it).\"\n\nMaterial items are just that, and can be replaced, but the thought of Brady's first Lombardi won without Bill Belichick ending up at the bottom of the Hillsborough River is still frightening.

Go figure.\"\n\nShe isn't the only voice attempting to reason with Brady these days. The quarterback recalled his experience immediately after his Buccaneers had secured the franchise's second Super Bowl triumph in its history, a moment in which Brady searched for his family on the field. With his children arriving first, Brady's wife, Gisele, followed closely behind, embracing the quarterback before dropping a hint.\n\n\"All of a sudden I saw my wife and I gave her a big hug, and just as I did it, she says 'what more do you have to prove?'\" Brady recalled with a chuckle.\n\nWhat more does Brady have to prove, after all? He's won more Super Bowls than any other player in NFL history, he's almost universally revered as the greatest to ever play the position, and his latest triumph proved he wasn't solely reliant on or a product of the Patriot Way. But as Brady described to Corden, playing football to him is like running on a treadmill at high speed for six months before it comes to an abrupt stop.\n\nBrady told Corden he tried to change the subject quickly when his wife asked him that question, and the reason is clear: Brady doesn't want to stop running, because he doesn't want to get rid of the treadmill."}

The US plan for those family members wasn't clear and the State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe rush to the exits marked an unsettling, tragic end to the US presence in Afghanistan as the Taliban retook control nearly 20 years after the US invaded to avenge the terror attacks of September 2001. After an investment of around $2 trillion, some 2,400 American lives lost and thousands more wounded, a nation-building project that spanned Republican and Democratic administrations devolved in just a few days into a complicated and nerve-wracking rescue mission.\n\nIn a Sunday phone briefing, Austin told House lawmakers Sunday that the evacuation was a \"highly dynamic and very risky operation,\" even as he and other senior US officials worked to project a sense of control.\n\n\"This is not Saigon,\" Secretary of State Antony Blinken told CNN's Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union,\" when asked about President Joe Biden's July assertion that under no circumstances would US personnel be airlifted out of Kabul in a replay of the US withdrawal from Vietnam in 1975.\n\n'Deliberate, orderly'\n\nBlinken said on ABC that instructions to diplomats to destroy documents, US flags or other items that could be used in Taliban propaganda are \"standard operating procedure.\" Echoing Austin's talking points, Blinken added that the evacuation \"is being done in a very deliberate way, orderly way. It's being done with American forces there to do it in a safe way.\"\n\nAt the same time, the US military is considering the possibility of sending additional US forces to Afghanistan, according to a defense official and US official familiar with the ongoing discussions. Both officials caution no decision has been made.\n\nThe defense official said the \"current plan\" is that as long as any US diplomats maintain a presence at the airport, there will be a contingent of US forces there to protect them. But the official acknowledged that if the Taliban are essentially in charge, the \"reality\" of keeping diplomats and troops at the airport may not hold.\n\nGen. Frank McKenzie, head of US Central Command, arrived in the Persian Gulf region Sunday to directly oversee the situation in Afghanistan, according to the defense official. The official declined to publicly name McKenzie's location, but said the general is not in Afghanistan.\n\nA military team was expected to arrive and set up its own air traffic control system at the airport in Kabul in order to increase the number of evacuation flights out of the airfield. This type of capability is routinely maintained by the Air Force so it can operate at airfields in remote or war zone environments.\n\n\"We are going to ramp up flights,\" the defense official said."}

We should get her a crash pad,'\" Rodriguez recalls. \"He was like, 'No, she's not going to fall all the way.' So we had like a furniture pad instead. And she ended up fully falling over and injuring herself. A furniture pad is not a pad that you would want to fall on. You should have a crash pad. We had stunts on set. It would have taken 60 seconds.\"\n\nHalls is now under intense scrutiny after he admittedly handed Alec Baldwin a loaded Colt revolver on the set of the Western movie Rust last Thursday and declared it a \"cold gun\" — indicating it was unloaded — shortly before the actor pulled the trigger and fatally shot cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.\n\nIn yet another incident before he was fired from Freedom's Path, Halls allegedly failed to step in when a crew member ran into a shot to remove an errant coat and subsequently fell and injured herself to the point that she \"couldn't get up and out of the shot,\" Rodriguez said.\n\n\"Traditionally, that would be where the first assistant director, whose job is safety, would call 'Cut,' and then step over to make sure the person was alright. That didn't happen. My second assistant camera [operator] ended up stepping in to make sure she was alright. I cut camera on my own,\" Rodriguez recalls.\n\n\"A lot of his mentality was just, 'Get the shot. And get the shot on time.' He seemed willing to cut whatever corners were necessary to make that happen,\" Rodriguez says of Halls.\n\nRodriguez says he also was on hand the day that Halls was fired. According to producers, the termination came after a gun \"unexpectedly discharged,\" causing \"a minor and temporary injury\" to a crew member.\n\nThat incident was previously reported by CNN, but Rodriguez gives new insight into what happened that day. He says the period movie involved handmade, muzzle-loaded firearms that would be filled with enough gunpowder to cause a flash when fired."}

(AP) — Motorists found gas pumps shrouded in plastic bags at tapped-out service stations across more than a dozen U.S. states Thursday while the operator of the nation's largest gasoline pipeline reported making \"substantial progress\" in resolving the computer responsible for the empty tanks.\n\nAbout 70% of North Carolina's gas stations were still without fuel amid panic-buying and about half the stations in Virginia, South Carolina and Georgia were tapped out, reported. Washington, D.C., was among the hardest-hit locations, with 73% of stations out, the site's tracking service showed.\n\nsaid Thursday that U.S. officials do not believe the Russian government was involved in the hack of the Colonial Pipeline, which stretches from Texas to New Jersey. But he added, \"We do have strong reason to believe that the criminals who did the attack are living in Russia. That's where it came from.\"\n\nA cyberattack by hackers who lock up computer systems and demand a ransom to release them hit the pipeline on Friday. The hackers did not take control of the pipeline's operations, but Colonial shut it down to contain the damage.\n\nThe U.S. was in direct communication with Moscow about the need to take action against ransom networks, Biden said. The FBI has said the ransomware belonged to a criminal syndicate known as DarkSide.\n\nAfter restarting operations Wednesday, Georgia-based Colonial Pipeline said in a Thursday update that gasoline deliveries were underway in all of its markets. It will take \"several days\" for things to return to normal, and some areas may experience \"intermittent service interruptions during this start-up period,\" the company said.\n\nThe Northeast has seen fewer shortages since those states get more of their gas supplies from ocean tankers and other sources. The Colonial Pipeline delivers about 45% of the gasoline consumed on the East Coast, but there were no gasoline shortages, according to government officials and energy analysts, just delays in delivering the fuel from Gulf Coast refineries.\n\n\"We are not out of the woods yet, but the trees are thinning out,\" Richard Joswick, global head of oil analytics at S&P Global Platts, said.\n\nGas stations next week, though, if the pipeline restart goes as planned and consumers are convinced that they no longer need to panic-buy fuel, Joswick said. He estimated that full recovery for the East and Gulf coasts would take at least a couple of weeks.\n\nIn Virginia, however, the pipeline shutdown still produced palpable effects Thursday. Stephen Brich, the highways commissioner, said the agency is limiting nonessential travel and asking its employees to continue working remotely as a conservation strategy. The decision impacts about 4,000 workers.\n\nWorkers are still responding to emergency issues such as potholes, malfunctioning traffic signals, guard rail problems, drainage issues and bridge issues. There are sufficient supplies of unleaded and diesel fuel to maintain services for several more weeks, Brich said.\n\nThe run on gas also prompted an urgent warning in the state that people should never siphon gasoline off by mouth with hoses, an advisory that followed calls in recent days about people who were poisoned. One man sucked gasoline into his lungs, causing significant distress, Dr. Chris Holstege, the medical director of the Blue Ridge Poison center at UVA Health, said.\n\nThe governors of both Virginia and North Carolina declared states of emergency to help ensure access to gasoline. Other governors urged people not to hoard supplies.\n\n\"There is available fuel supply in and around our state, and it will take time for tankers to move that supply to the stations that are experiencing shortages,\" North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said. He reiterated calls for residents not to make any unnecessary trips to the pump."}

Armored vehicles and concrete barriers blocked empty streets. Miles of fencing cordoned off many of the nation's most familiar landmarks.\n\nJoe Biden was safely sworn in as president in a Washington on edge, two weeks after rioters loyal to former President Donald Trump besieged the Capitol.\n\nLaw enforcement officials contended not only with the potential for outside threats but also with rising concerns about an insider attack. Officials monitored members of far-right extremist and militia groups, increasingly concerned about the risk they could stream into Washington and spark violent confrontations, a law enforcement official said.\n\nThere were a few scattered arrests but no major protests or serious disruptions in the city during Biden's inauguration ceremony.\n\nAs Biden put it in his address: \"Here we stand just days after a riotous mob thought they could use violence to silence the will of the people, to stop the work of our democracy, to drive us from this sacred ground. It did not happen. It will never happen, not today, not tomorrow, not ever. Not ever.\"\n\nAfter the deadly attack that killed five on Jan. 6, the Secret Service stepped up security for the inauguration early, essentially locking down the nation's capital. More than 25,000 troops and police were called to duty. The National Mall was closed. Checkpoints were set up at intersections.\n\nIn the hours before the event, federal agents monitored \"concerning online chatter,\" which included an array of threats against elected officials and discussions about ways to infiltrate the inauguration, the official said.\n\nIn right-wing online chat groups, believers in the QAnon conspiracy theory expressed disappointment that top Democrats were not arrested for sex trafficking and that Trump did not seize a second term.\n\nTwelve National Guard members were removed from the security operation a day earlier after vetting by the FBI, including two who had made extremist statements in posts or texts about Wednesday's event. Pentagon officials would not give details on the statements. The FBI vetted all 25,000 members in an extraordinary security effort in part over the presence of some ex-military in the riot.\n\nTwo other U.S. officials told The Associated Press that all 12 were found to have ties with right-wing militia groups or to have posted extremist views online. The officials, a senior intelligence official and an Army official briefed on the matter, did not say which fringe groups the Guard members belonged to or what unit they served in. The officials told the AP they had all been removed because of \"security liabilities.\"\n\nThe officials were not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nGen. Daniel Hokanson, chief of the National Guard Bureau, confirmed that Guard members had been removed and sent home, but said only two cases were related to inappropriate comments or texts related to the inauguration. He said the other 10 cases were for issues that may involve previous criminal behavior or activities but were not directly related to the inaugural event.\n\nThe FBI also warned law enforcement officials about the possibility that members of right-wing fringe groups could pose as National Guard troops, according to two law enforcement officials familiar with the matter.\n\nInvestigators in Washington were particularly worried that members of right-wing extremist groups and militias, like the Oath Keepers and Three Percenters, would descend on Washington to spark violence, the law enforcement officials said. Some of the groups are known to recruit former military personnel, to train extensively and to have frequented anti-government and political protests."}

He observed the global supply chain has been built \"...\" on top of ice shavings and toothpicks. There are weak points everywhere. Suez isn't the only one.\n\n\"A lot of companies outsource different parts of their supply chain to be managed by others, which makes them passive consumers of other peoples' mistakes.

They don't know what their alternatives are.\"\n\nHe noted that, \"There are cheap manufacturers on different continents, but you pay the price in the complexity of your supply chain. It is a hidden price until Suez happen[ed], and then it is not hidden anymore.\"\n\nNicholson predicted the current canal blockage, \".... and other events are going to push companies to look at more alternatives like onshoring and nearshoring, which will coincide with Biden's policies to recenter the U.S. supply chain in North America.\"\n\nSudden Impact\n\nIt did not take long for the stranded ship to create crisis situations for others.\n\nLukas Kinigadner is the CEO and co-founder of Anyline, a mobile data company. \"Our supply chains are the arteries of industry, and in the era of same-day delivery and 'just-in-time' inventory, even a small blockage can cause headaches and disruptions down the line,\" he observed.\n\nThe delays caused by the blockage of the Suez Canal,\" ... are already mounting, with oil prices already jumping, while car and computer manufacturers have raised the alarm over a worsening shortage of computer chips,\" Kinigadner said."}

The president/director general of Facebook France has just contacted me personally to tell me the Ville de Bitche page is published again and to apologise for the inconvenience caused.\"\n\nFacebook told the Guardian the page was unpublished because of an incorrect analysis by its systems and has now been restored.\n\nThe town's page disappeared from Facebook on 19 March without any warning or apparent reason. In the interim, town hall staff created a new page, Mairie 57230, the town's postcode, to keep its residents up to date with local news and information.\n\nBefore the page was reinstated, Valérie Degouy, a spokesperson for Bitche, toldthe local radio station Radio Melodie: \"I appealed on 19 March but [the page] hasn't reappeared again. I have tried every way to contact Facebook, through the different forms, but there is nothing more to do. I tried to send a private message on the Facebook France page, I left about 10 messages every day. I was finally contacted and told that they were not in charge, that if I appealed, I would have to wait for a response from Facebook.\n\n\"I already had problems when I created the town's Facebook page. I could not enter the word Bitche, it was impossible. I had to create a page that I had called Ville fortifiée, and change it afterwards, in the description, to say that it was the official page of the town of Bitche and point out at the same time, the username was Ville de Bitche.

Bush replaced him as the United States found itself bogged down after 3-1/2 years of fighting, has died at age 88, his family said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\n\"It is with deep sadness that we share the news of the passing of Donald Rumsfeld, an American statesman and devoted husband, father, grandfather and great grandfather,\" the statement said. \"At 88, he was surrounded by family in his beloved Taos, New Mexico.\"\n\nThe statement did not say when Rumsfeld died.\n\nRumsfeld, who ranks with Vietnam War-era defense secretary Robert McNamara as the most powerful men to hold the post, brought charisma and bombast to the Pentagon job, projecting the Bush administration's muscular approach to world affairs.\n\nWith Rumsfeld in charge, U.S. forces swiftly toppled Iraqi President Saddam Hussein but failed to maintain law and order in the aftermath, and Iraq descended into chaos with a bloody insurgency and violence between Sunni and Shi'ite Muslims. U.S. troops remained in Iraq until 2011, long after he left his post.\n\nRumsfeld played a leading role ahead of the war in making the case to the world for the March 2003 invasion. He warned of the dangers of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction but no such weapons were ever discovered.\n\nOnly McNamara served as defense secretary for longer than Rumsfeld, who had two stints - from 1975 to 1977 under President Gerald Ford, for whom he also served as White House chief of staff, and from 2001 to 2006 under Bush.\n\nRumsfeld was known for imperious treatment of some military officers and members of Congress and infighting with other members of the Bush team, including Secretary of State Colin Powell. He also alienated U.S. allies in Europe.\n\nIn 2004, Bush twice refused to accept Rumsfeld's offer to resign after photos surfaced of U.S. personnel abusing prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison outside Baghdad. The scandal triggered international condemnation of the United States.\n\nThe United States faced global condemnation after the photos showed U.S. troops smiling, laughing and giving thumbs up as prisoners were forced into sexually abusive and humiliating positions including a naked human pyramid and simulated sex. One photo showed a prisoner forced to stand on a small box, his head covered in a black hood, with wires attached to his body.\n\nRumsfeld personally authorized harsh interrogation techniques for detainees. The U.S. treatment of detainees in Iraq and foreign terrorism suspects at a special prison set up under Rumsfeld at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, drew international condemnation, with human rights activists and others saying prisoners were tortured.\n\nHe was a close ally of Bush's vice president, Dick Cheney, who had worked for Rumsfeld during the 1970s Republican presidencies of Richard Nixon and Ford.\n\nRumsfeld became a lightning rod for criticism and, with the Iraq war largely a stalemate and public support eroding, Bush replaced him in November 2006 over Cheney's objections.\n\nDays after vowing Rumsfeld would remain for the rest of his term, Bush announced his departure a day after mid-term elections in which Democrats took control of Congress from Bush's Republicans amid voter anger over the Iraq War.\n\nRobert Gates, a soft-spoken but demanding former CIA director, took over from Rumsfeld in December 2006 and made sweeping strategic and military leadership changes in Iraq."}

Much of their trip was documented on social media accounts that abruptly ceased.\n\nInvestigators have determined that the disappearance of Gabrielle \"Gabby\" Petito is not related to a double homicide in Moab last month that left a couple dead, the Grand County Sheriff's Office announced Friday.\n\nKylen Schulte, 24, and Crystal Turner, 38, were found shot to death in a creek near their Moab-area campsite on Aug. 18, police have said.

But North Port Police Chief Todd Garrison said during a news conference that day that investigators there had \"communication going back and forth with the Grand County Sheriff's Office.\"\n\n\"We provided them with whatever information we could,\" Garrison said at the time. \"They don't have any [murder] suspect information right now. ...

Richard Burr (N.C.), Bill Cassidy (La.), Susan Collins (Maine), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Mitt Romney (Utah), Ben Sasse (Neb.) and Patrick J. Toomey (Pa.). Only once before had even one member of a president's party voted to convict: Romney voted to convict in Trump's previous impeachment trial.\n\nNotably, the number of GOP votes for conviction was larger than the previous number in support of proceeding with the trial. In total, 17 Republicans voted either to impeach Trump or convict him during these proceedings — with both the 10 House impeachment votes and the seven conviction votes being unprecedented.\n\nBut Cassidy's vote might be the most significant. Burr and Toomey are retiring, and the others have been high-profile critics of Trump. Cassidy comes from one of the most conservative states in the country. Even his vote to proceed with the trial last week — after he previously voted that the trial was unconstitutional — led to predictions that he would eventually fall in line. As with several other Republicans, he risked a great deal to vote as he did.\n\nOne key vote the House impeachment managers did not get was that of another senator who had expressed openness to conviction: Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). McConnell suggested in a speech after the vote that he indeed blamed Trump, saying, \"President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day.\" But he said Trump's status as former president rendered the issues at hand moot.\n\nGiven the historically bipartisan votes, though, you have to wonder whether, had McConnell decided to press the issue, he could have assembled enough votes for a conviction.\n\nIt probably never would have happened, but it was closer than most predicted.\n\n2. The Democrats' back-down\n\nAs the trial began on Tuesday, a disconnect emerged. Democrats said this situation was vitally important — so important that they needed to impeach Trump for the second time and then, for the first time in history, hold a Senate trial for a former president — yet they didn't plan to call any witnesses to unearth new evidence.\n\nFor a brief period Saturday, given that several huge questions remained unresolved, it appeared they were reversing course. They called for a subpoena of Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-Wash.) to describe Trump's phone call with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) during the Capitol riot.\n\nThen they backed off. A deal was cut under which Beutler's statement suggesting Trump had spoken approvingly of the Capitol rioters in real time would be entered into the trial record, and no witnesses would be called.\n\nIt's easy to call this a cave. As many noted, Democrats seemed to have the votes for witnesses, with several Republicans voting with them on the broader question of whether to allow witnesses. Enough Republicans appeared to be on board and conviction-curious to hear from the likes of Herrera Beutler and others. Trump's lawyers could have requested all the witnesses they wanted — and they threatened to call hundreds — but each would have required a vote. Democrats held the cards.\n\nAnd then they laid down their hand."}

In Washington, the nation's capital, 80% of gas stations are without fuel, according to the latest data from GasBuddy. In North Carolina 63% of stations are short, in Georgia and South Carolina more than 40%, and in Virginia 38%.\n\nThe cyberattack had forced the company to shut down approximately 5,500 miles of pipeline and triggered widespread fuel shortages in the Southeast and panic buying in some states.\n\nColonial carries nearly half of the fuel supply on the East Coast, including gasoline, diesel fuel, heating oil and jet fuel.

We also recognize that Facebook is a private entity with its own First Amendment rights to control the content it publishes. But Facebook's decision to ban Trump nonetheless illustrates serious shortcomings in its content-related decision making — as its own Oversight Board (OB) properly declared yesterday in reviewing the decision. Facebook exercises quasi-monopoly power over a critical forum in our marketplace of ideas, and for many of the same reasons that we would be suspicious of a central government authority controlling what can and cannot be said, we have concerns with Facebook exercising such unchecked power.\n\nThe OB ruled that Facebook's initial decision to suspend former President Trump's account for 24 hours on Jan. 6, 2021, after the attack on the Capitol, was proper, but that its subsequent decision to suspend his account indefinitely — a sanction that is not mentioned in Facebook's policies — was inappropriate. The board put the decision about a permanent ban back in Facebook's hands, to be made in the next six months according to the rules the company applies to other users.\n\nAs pernicious as Trump's speech was, the decisions by Facebook and other social media companies to remove Trump from their platforms highlight the immense power these corporations wield over our collective ability to speak online. For the foreseeable future, Facebook, Twitter, and a handful of other corporations will make some of the most consequential decisions affecting free expression. They present themselves as platforms for free speech rather than edited or curated newspapers. But historically they have failed to apply their own rules consistently, equitably, and transparently, or to adhere to basic notions of fair process in how they exercise the awesome power to decide what gets published on, and who can access, their forums.\n\nPerfectly consistent content moderation is impossible in light of the scale at which these platforms operate. But Facebook's failure to abide by basic principles of fairness and transparency are unacceptable given the influence they exert over our national debate. Facebook and similar platforms should err on the side of free expression, not censorship, while also offering users direct control over the content they see. Facebook effectively determines the boundaries of political speech for billions of users, even as it remains beholden to its bottom line, not the public interest.\n\nIn an attempt to add some accountability and transparency, Facebook created an Oversight Board to help it review hard questions regarding content moderation. But the company still holds too much unaccountable power over the process. The OB rightly highlighted many concerns with Facebook policies and practices that we share, but the decision also leaves crucial questions unanswered. Below we break down our take on this issue and the board's decision.\n\nWhat does the ACLU think of the Oversight Board's decision?"}

When asked by the outlet if he would be able to play golf again, the athlete declined to answer.\n\nUltimately, the Los Angeles County Sheriff found that speed was the primary cause of Woods' single-car rollover crash, but that there were \"no signs of impairment\" and that the pro golfer would not be cited for the accident.\n\nA Round with Tiger: Celebrity Playing Lessons airs Tuesdays on Golf Digest through August 10."}

The latest KFF COVID-19 Vaccine Monitor survey of parents was conducted prior to the emergence of the omicron COVID-19 variant, and we will continue to track parents' attitudes and intentions as more information emerges on the potential impact of this new variant on children.\n\nSafety and potential side effects continue to be prominent concerns when it comes to parents' views of COVID-19 vaccines for kids. While about six in ten parents (63%) say they are confident that the COVID-19 vaccines are safe for adults, fewer say they are confident the vaccines are safe for children between the ages of 12 and 17 (52%) and for children ages 5 to 11 (43%). Most parents say getting infected with COVID-19 would be a bigger risk to their child's health than getting vaccinated. However, majorities of unvaccinated parents and Republican parents believe the vaccine poses a greater risk than the virus itself, even though scientific bodies have concluded the opposite is the case.\n\nAccess barriers are also a concern for some parents when it comes to getting their children vaccinated. Hispanic parents, Black parents, and those with lower incomes are more likely than other parents to say they are concerned they might have to miss work to get their child vaccinated, that they won't have a trusted place to go, or that they'll have difficulty traveling to a vaccination location.\n\nPediatricians remain parents' most trusted source of information on the COVID-19 vaccine for children, including across partisans and across race and ethnicity. Still, fewer than half of parents of children ages 5 to 17 have talked with their child's pediatrician or health care provider about the vaccine. Notably, not all pediatricians are recommending that parents get their children vaccinated for COVID-19; among the 40% of parents who spoke with their child's health care provider, one-third (16% total parents of teens) say the provider did not recommend the COVID-19 vaccine for their teen and four in ten (15% of total parents of 5-11 year-olds) say the doctor did not recommend it for their child ages 5-11.\n\nAbout half of parents of school-age children say their child's school provided information about how to get their child vaccinated for COVID-19, and more than four in ten say their child's school encouraged parents to get their children vaccinated. Parents who say their school has encouraged them to get their children vaccinated are more likely to say their child has indeed gotten vaccinated. In fact, parents of 5-11 year-olds whose school encouraged vaccination are four times as likely as those whose school did not encourage vaccination to say their younger child has already gotten the COVID-19 vaccine (28% vs. 7%). While previous KFF Vaccine Monitor reports have shown that a majority of the public supports COVID-19 vaccination requirements for K-12 school teachers, parents oppose schools requiring COVID-19 vaccines for eligible students by a 2-to-1 margin.\n\nParents and families have been particularly hard-hit by the COVID-19 pandemic with nearly three in four of parents (73%) saying the pandemic has had a negative impact on their children's education, almost six in ten (58%) saying it has negatively impacted their own mental health, and half reporting a negative impact on their ability to pay for basic necessities (50%). The share reporting a negative financial impact is substantially higher among lower-income parents compared to those with higher incomes and among Black and Hispanic parents compared to White parents. In addition, mothers are more likely than fathers to say the pandemic has taken a toll on their financial situation as well as their mental and physical health."}

The inaugural special, titled \"Celebrating America,\" echoed Biden's calls for unity amid a difficult time in the nation's history.\n\nBiden gave brief remarks during the special, repeating calls for Americans to come together and heal. He gave thanks to Americans and pressed the importance of democracy.\n\n\"As I said earlier today, we have learned again that democracy is precious and because of you democracy has prevailed,\" Biden said.\n\n\"That's why Jill and I, Kamala and Doug wanted to make sure our inauguration was not about us, but you, the American people,\" Biden said. \"To overcome the challenges in front of us requires the most elusive of all things in a democracy: unity.\"\n\nHarris talked about the power of \"American aspiration\" in her first speech to the nation as vice president.\n\nWith the Washington Monument lit up behind her Wednesday night, Harris called on Americans to remember \"we are undaunted in our belief that we shall overcome, that we will rise up.\"\n\nShe also cast her ascension as the first female vice president as a demonstration of the nation's character.\n\nBorrowing a line she frequently used on the campaign trail, she said, \"We not only see what has been — we see what can be.\"\n\nHarris gave a nod to American scientists, parents and teachers who are persevering through the coronavirus pandemic and encouraged people to \"see beyond crises.\"\n\nEarlier that day during his inauguration, Biden declared, \"democracy has prevailed\" at the same location that had been attacked by a pro-Trump mob just two weeks earlier.\n\nJoined by first lady Jill Biden and family, Biden entered the White House for the first time as president to begin the work of a new administration and confront a historic confluence of crises."}

Meghan stayed behind at their home in California, as advised by her doctor. She is in the last months of her pregnancy with the couple's second child. The Duke of Sussex is reportedly staying at his former cottage at Kensington Palace as he self-isolates for five days due to COVID-19 protocols.\n\nContrary to much speculation, Philip was not perturbed by the fact that Harry and Meghan's Winfrey interview aired while he was in the hospital last month, according to Brandeth.\n\n\"What did worry him was the couple's preoccupation with their own problems and their willingness to talk about them in public,\" Brandeth said.\n\nPhilip, proud of his duty to his country and to his wife, Queen Elizabeth, was fine with members of the royal family giving TV interviews. But Brandeth said he always insisted: \"Don't talk about yourself.\"\n\nPhilip had also said it was \"madness\" for Prince Charles and Princess Diana to give personal, tell-all interviews in the 1990s, Brandeth said.\n\nIt was \"one of his rules,\" Brandeth said, explaining that Philip thought it was self-indulgent for rich and privileged royal family members to expect that the public cared about their troubles.\n\n\"I know he shared (this rule) with his children,\" Brandeth said. \"I imagine he shared it with his grandchildren, too.\"\n\nBrandreth said Philip told him more than once: \"It's a big mistake to think about yourself. No one is interested in you in the long run. Don't court popularity. It doesn't last. Remember that the attention comes because of the position you are privileged to hold, not because of who you are. If you think it's all about you, you'll never be happy.\"\n\nPhilip had been proud that Harry, who served in the army for 10 years, including in Afghanistan, had succeeded him as Captain General of the Royal Marines in 2017.\n\nBut Philip accepted the decision by the queen, Charles and William that Harry and Meghan couldn't continue working as senior royals if they also wanted to pursue philanthropic endeavors and lucrative media deals on the side.\n\nMany eyes will be on Harry's interactions with the royal family during Philip's service, which will be televised from St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. Harry and Meghan married at the chapel in an extravagant, globally televised wedding in May 2018."}

Many of our colleagues (including leading scientists and health-care professionals) have died. We have also seen how much harder it has become for people with HIV to get treatment and monitoring, which has meant more people being admitted to hospital with serious illnesses such as tuberculosis and cryptococcal meningitis.\n\nAs the world shifts gear in the COVID-19 pandemic — from tackling the immediate crisis to a long-term public-health response — we urge governments, health ministries, researchers and other stakeholders worldwide to devote more of their resources and attention to the interactions between COVID-19 and HIV.\n\nVarious studies from before the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines show that people with HIV are 30–50% more likely to die from COVID-19. What's more, a failure to tackle the pandemic with sufficient urgency in countries with high rates of uncontrolled advanced HIV could lead to the emergence of variants of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that spread more easily between people or render the vaccines less effective. Conversely, both diseases could be curbed more effectively if they are tackled simultaneously, with public-health responses strengthened by the lessons learnt from both.\n\nRisk analysis\n\nIn 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) created a platform for standardized clinical data obtained from people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. A preliminary analysis of these data from 37 countries (most of which come from South Africa) revealed that, controlling for other factors, people with HIV were 30% more likely to die from COVID-19 among those hospitalized with the disease1.\n\nIn a more detailed analysis2 of hospitalized cases in South Africa, only people with HIV at an advanced stage were more likely to die from COVID-19. People in this group are severely immunocompromised: individuals have a blood count of fewer than 200 CD4 T cells per microlitre, compared with 500–1,500 cells per microlitre in people without HIV. (CD4 T cells are white blood cells crucial for fighting infection.) In a population-based analysis of around 3.5 million people from the Western Cape Province of South Africa (around 500,000 of whom were HIV-positive), people with HIV were twice as likely to die from COVID-193. But for those with uncontrolled or advanced HIV, the risk of dying from COVID‐19 was almost four times higher3.\n\nOther reports over the past year from various countries indicate that people with weakened immune systems can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 for several weeks or months. (By contrast, those who are otherwise healthy take, on average, around two weeks to clear an infection.) Such prolonged infections have mainly been documented in people receiving cancer chemotherapy and other immunosuppressive agents. But they have also been seen in people with advanced uncontrolled HIV."}

Lawyer Albert Watkins said it's important for senators to hear the voice of someone who was incited by Mr. Trump.\n\nWatkins said his client was previously \"horrendously smitten\" by Mr. Trump but now feels let down after Mr. Trump's refusal to grant Chansley and others who participated in the insurrection a pardon. \"He felt like he was betrayed by the president,\" Watkins said.\n\nWatkins said he hasn't spoken to any member in the Senate since announcing his offer to have Chansley — also known as Jake Angeli — testify at the trial, which is scheduled to begin the week of February 8.\n\nThe words of Trump supporters who are accused of participating in the riot may end up being used against him in his impeachment trial. Chansley and at least four others people who are facing federal charges stemming from the riot have suggested they were taking orders from the now-former president.\n\nChansley, who calls himself the \"QAnon Shaman\" and has long been a fixture at Trump rallies, hasn't yet entered a plea to charges of civil disorder, obstruction of an official proceeding, disorderly conduct in a restricted building, demonstrating in a Capitol building and other counts. He is scheduled to be arraigned Friday in Washington.\n\nIn successfully seeking his detention until trial, prosecutors said Chansley went into the Capitol carrying a U.S. flag attached to a wooden pole topped with a spear and ignored an officer's commands to leave. Prosecutors said Chansley entered the Senate chamber with a group of about 25 rioters, posed for pictures at the dais where then-Vice President Mike Pence had been minutes before, and left a note that read, \"It's only a matter of time. Justice is coming.\"\n\nThe following day, prosecutors say Chansley called the FBI Washington field office, admitted his involvement and described Pence as a \"child-trafficking traitor,\" but said he did not intend the note to be a threat. When asked about the meaning of the note, he launched into a \"lengthy diatribe\" describing current and past lawmakers including Pence, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden as \"infiltrators involved in various types of wrongdoing.\"\n\nChansley told investigators he came to the Capitol \"at the request of the president that all 'patriots' come to D.C. on January 6,\" according to court records."}

That will effectively delete facial recognition data and profiles for 1 billion users.\n\nThe move follows investigations, regulatory problems, and a class-action lawsuit, along with the increasingly scrutinous public's opinions on facial recognition technology overall. Digital rights advocates say Facebook is striking a blow against invasive surveillance, but this may be too little too late from the enormous organization. It's also not clear where other companies will fall on the issue of facial recognition.\n\nThe New York Times reported that Facebook will shut down its facial recognition system this month after all the regulatory headaches:\n\n\"When the Federal Trade Commission fined Facebook a record $5 billion to settle privacy complaints in 2019, the facial recognition software was among the concerns. Last year, the company also agreed to pay $650 million to settle a class-action lawsuit in Illinois that accused Facebook of violating a state law that requires residents' consent to use their biometric information, including their 'face geometry.'\"\n\nThe move comes after a series of high profile problems for Facebook, including a major leak about the company's misinformation peddling via advertising and a subsequent series of congressional hearings and inquiries. About a third of users have facial recognition features turned on in their Facebook settings, which is used to alert them of new photos, to root out photos stolen by fake accounts, and to help caption photos for blind users. (Facebook's automatic captioning still works, it just won't include specific user names anymore.)\n\nFight for the Future campaign director Caitlin Seeley George said in a statement that all facial recognition technology should be banned, making this a good step for Facebook. \"From misidentifying Black and Brown people (which has already led to wrongful arrests) to making it impossible to move through our lives without being constantly surveilled, we cannot trust governments, law enforcement, or private companies with this kind of invasive surveillance,\" she said."}

Rabie said the figure is based on canal revenue losses, the cost of equipment and machinery, and the manpower hours for the 800 rescuers who freed the ship. \"We will ask for a fair amount,\" Rabie said, according to a NBC News translation, without specifying who might be liable to pay. \"We saved them so much by rescuing the ship without any major damage or losses,\" he added. \"The whole ship could've been lost.\" The 200,000 ton mega-container carrier was successfully refloated on Monday, six days after coming stuck sideways in the Suez Canal.

Authorities said the backlog would be cleared by Saturday, but the maritime traffic jam could have long lasting repercussions on ports and supply chains worldwide. Rabie said he hoped a compensation agreement could be reached \"in two or three days\" and if not, Egypt might hold the ship in the Great Bitter Lake, north of the Suez Canal, where it is currently undergoing maintenance checks. \"We could agree on a certain compensation, or it goes to court,\" he said. \"If they decide to go to court, then the ship should be held,\" he warned."}

On its way from China to Rotterdam, in the Netherlands, the boat accidentally Tokyo drifted to a stop in Egypt's Suez Canal on Tuesday, where it has been stuck sideways ever since. Efforts to refloat the Ever Given so far have been futile; the heavy construction equipment and fleet of industrial-strength tugboats assigned to that job have been successful not at dislodging the ship's bow from the canal's sandy shore, but at demonstrating this big-ass boat's stupendous girth in photos. The ship, which is longer than the Empire State Building is tall, looms over literally everything—construction equipment, palm trees, nearby buildings. The Ever Given is Manute Bol to the human world's Muggsy Bogues.\n\nMy therapist had not seen the boat, even though photos of it had already begun to be manufactured into memes about life's existential problems and the stupid little things we all do to feel some control over them. I asked her to Google it in front of me, because I had become obsessed. Since Tuesday afternoon, in fact, I have thought about little else. The first photos I saw of it were taken by workers on the Maersk Denver, the ship that was immediately behind the Ever Given when a wind storm is suspected to have blown her sideways. (Yes, the boats are girls.) I spent much of yesterday hunting down photos of the boat, both in situ and in happier times. I acquainted myself with websites like VesselFinder and MarineTraffic, as well as with the concept of Suezmax and the phrase bulbous bow, which the Ever Given has and which means that she is not just on top of the sand, but also lodged inside it.\n\nI'm obsessed with the dang boat because people like me and you are not really supposed to be aware of what boats like her are up to. You're not supposed to think about, or even notice, global freight, but the Ever Given has made cartoonishly noticeable some of the crucial infrastructure of global capital, which is usually invisible in most people's daily life. She has done so with an absolutely sublime visual gag, improved by every new detail about the problems the ship is causing and every new photo of the impotent human measures being undertaken to fix them. Peruse the surrounding waterways on any of the internet's maritime trackers, and you'll find the beginnings of a far more significant problem: More than 150 other absolutely huge shipping vessels, transporting everything from live animals to crude oil, are waiting on either side; the barge ran aground at a point where the Suez has only one lane, which means that traffic is blocked in both directions."}

Rick Santorum in an interview on Monday walked back widely-criticized comments he made last month about Native American culture in the United States.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\n\"We birthed a nation from nothing,\" Santorum said on April 23. \"I mean, there was nothing here. I mean, yes, we have Native Americans but candidly there isn't much Native American culture in American culture.\"\n\nCNN host Chris Cuomo gave Santorum the floor to explain himself during a segment of \"Cuomo Prime Time.\"\n\n\"This seemed like you were trying to erase diversity in the interest of some white Christian right,\" Cuomo told Santorum.\n\n\"I misspoke,\" said Santorum, a political commentator for CNN. \"What I was talking about is, as you can see from the run-up, I was talking about the founding of our country. I had given a long talk about the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence and the ideas behind those, and that I was saying we sort of created that anew, if you will.\"\n\nHe went on to say: \"I was not trying to dismiss Native Americans. In fact, I mentioned them because yes, they were here, and they did have an impact, in fact, in this country ... I misspoke in this respect — I was talking about the founding and the principles embodied in the founding.\"\n\nSantorum made the controversial remarks during a speech at a conservative youth organization, and critics accused him of overlooking the role of Native Americans in the US and downplaying the atrocities committed against them.\n\nOn Monday, Santorum tried to distance himself from his previous statements and told Cuomo that \"the way we treated Native Americans was horrific.\"\n\nCuomo confronted Santorum over his comments, telling him: \"You're like me. You're a mutt, who came here a couple of generations ago, Rick. You ain't no pilgrim, OK?\"\n\n\"Yep,\" Santorum replied.\n\nShortly after the interview, CNN anchor Don Lemon said he was \"furious\" with Santorum's explanation.\n\n\"I cannot believe the first words out of his mouth weren't: 'I'm sorry, I said something ignorant,'\" Lemon said. \"Did he actually think it was a good idea for him to come on television and try to whitewash the whitewash that he whitewashed? It was horrible.\"\n\n\"It was so egregious and insulting,\" he added."}

Angela Paxton, left Texas and traveled to Utah last week while the state was being rocked by severe winter storms.\n\nPaxton's campaign spokesperson, Ian Prior, would not tell CNN when the couple had departed or returned but said the attorney general \"did not leave Texas until after power had returned to most of the state, including his own home.\"\n\n\"Attorney General Paxton attended a previously planned meeting with the attorney general of Utah to discuss several matters,\" Prior said, listing a law enforcement scenario simulator demonstration and \"strategizing\" on a Google lawsuit as some of the reasons for the travel.\n\nPaxton's trip, which was first reported by the Dallas Morning News, makes him the second high-profile Republican to leave the state during the crisis, after Sen. Ted Cruz was spotted on a plane headed to Cancun, Mexico, last week while millions of Texans were left without power or water. After returning to Houston on Thursday afternoon, Cruz told reporters outside his home it was \"obviously a mistake\" and that \"in hindsight I wouldn't have done it.\"\n\n\"I started having second thoughts almost the moment I sat down on the plane, because on the one hand, all of us who are parents have a responsibility to take care of our kids, take care of our family. That's something Texans have been doing across the state,\" said Cruz, who had said in an earlier statement that he had flown to Mexico because his daughters had asked to take a trip and he was trying to be a \"good dad.\"\n\nAs an official elected to federal office, Cruz doesn't have an on-the-ground role in the response to the storm, but natural disasters are often a time in which constituents reach out to their elected officials for help and access to resources.\n\nAs Texas attorney general, Paxton is responsible for overseeing key aspects of the state's response to the devastating winter storm.\n\nAs a result, he's faced swift backlash from Democratic politicians in the state, including Texas Democratic Party Chair Gilberto Hinojosa, who said in a statement, \"Texas Republicans do not give a damn about the people they were elected to represent, and they continue to focus on issues that don't affect the lives of everyday Texans to gaslight them into thinking they are doing their jobs.\"\n\nFormer Housing and Urban Development Secretary and Texas native Julian Castro similarly tweeted that Paxton and Cruz \"couldn't care less about the people they're supposed to represent.\""}

The procedures were done at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where he was transferred Wednesday night. Woods initially stayed at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center for three days following the crash, had a rod placed in his tibia and screws and pins inserted in his foot and ankle during emergency surgery.\n\nIn a statement posted to Twitter on Friday, Woods' account announced the additional surgeries.\n\nTiger has moved to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and received follow-up procedures on his injuries this morning. The procedures were successful, and he is now recovering and in good spirits. Tiger and his family want to thank you all for he wonderful supports and messages they have received over the past few days. We will not have any further updates at this time. Thank you for your continued privacy.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department indicated on Tuesday that Woods would have been transported to a facility other than Harbor-UCLA, a tier 1 trauma center, had his injuries been life-threatening. Instead, he landed at Harbor-UCLA for surgery on numerous substantial injuries in his lower right leg. The incident was ruled \"purely accidental\" following an investigation by the LACSD.\n\nOfficers also indicated that Tiger's life was saved because he was wearing his seatbelt and driving a 2021 Genesis SUV. The vehicle ended up hundreds of feet from a median, which he crossed, down at the bottom of a sloping gulley off the side of the road. According to the LACSD, Woods was alert and conscious at the scene of the crash -- despite a crushed front portion of his SUV -- before he was transported to Harbor-UCLA.\n\nAnish Mahajan, the chief medical officer of Harbor-UCLA, provided a detailed update on Tiger's surgeries on Tuesday evening following his admittance to the hospital.\n\nMr. Tiger Woods was transferred to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for continuing orthopedic care and recovery. To respect patient confidentiality, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center will not provide any further information about the patient's care. On behalf of our staff, it was an honor to provide orthopedic trauma care to one of our generation's greatest athletes.\n\nDr. Michael Zuri, a specailist in sports injuries, told CBS Sports it was likely that Woods would need additional surgeries in the near and distant future as his right leg continues to heal from extensive injuries that required screws, rods and a fasciotomy \"to relieve pressure due to swelling.\""}
